The former prime minister made the call in an opinion piece published in the Spectator Magazine on Monday. Australia gives more than $40m a year in aid to Palestine, provided through United Nations agencies and some charitable organisations. The money goes towards projects to provide Palestinian refugees with basic services such as health, education, water and sanitation. Last year, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade suspended aid to World Vision’s work in the Palestinian territories in the wake of allegations the charity’s head in Gaza funnelled millions of dollars to militant group Hamas. The organisation has denied the claims, which are subject to court proceedings in Israel. Abbott also said Australia could demonstrate “unswerving support for Israel” by joining any move by the incoming Trump administration to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Most governments have kept their embassy out of Jerusalem because they do not recognise Israel’s occupation of east Jerusalem since 1967. Noting that Israel’s GDP per person was about $40,000 a year, compared with Palestine’s of about $2,000, Abbott blamed the economic problems of the territories on “a focus on politics over economics and the all-pervading sense of grievance” among Palestinians. Last week the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, strongly indicated that Australia would not have supported a UN resolution – co-sponsored by New Zealand – criticising Israel’s settlements policy in the West Bank and east Jerusalem. The Israeli government reacted furiously when the US abstained on the resolution. The acting opposition leader, Chris Bowen, said Australian assistance to Gaza and the West Bank was vital to counter extremism and promote peace in the Middle East. “Mr Abbott is clearly using this as yet another issue to undermine Malcolm Turnbull and continue his campaign to regain the leadership by appealing to the hardliners in the Liberal party,” Bowen said. Australia’s aid program must be transparent and accountable and must reach those it was intended to benefit, he said. Abbott recently returned from a trip to the Middle East, including Israel. He attended the Australia-Israel-UK Dialogue in Jerusalem with opposition leader Bill Shorten and other federal MPs. In his article Abbott also noted that at the dialogue Professor Nir Shaviv of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem “methodically debunked the climate change theories peddled by the UN Panel”. If he was right, Abbott wrote, “countries like ours have been inflicting pointless economic pain upon themselves’.','https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jan/02/tony-abbott-australia-suspend-aid-palestinian-authority','Tony Abbott says Australia should suspend aid to Palestinian Authority',11),('business/2017/jan/01/robin-hoods-sherwood-forest-faces-fracking-threat','The latest battleground for the future of fracking in Britain looks set to be Sherwood Forest, the legendary home of folk hero Robin Hood and now the target of a seismic survey by Ineos. The chemical multinational, which relocated its headquarters back to the UK last month, appears to have agreed terms with the Forestry commission to start burying charges and spend up to two years using “thumper trucks” or vibroseis machines to search for shale gas. Campaigners have called on the government to block any possible fracking and protect the forest. According to documents obtained under freedom of information request by Friends of the Earth, Ineos could be working within 200 metres of the Major Oak, a 1,000-year old tree that in folklore sheltered Robin Hood and his merry men. Commercial fracking has yet to start in Britain, although Ineos and other firms have obtained licences from the government for shale gas exploration. The technology has been deeply controversial since tests conducted by Cuadrilla in 2011 caused earth tremors near Blackpool, but fracking operations are expected to restart in five wells in Yorkshire and Lancashire later this year. A small protest camp has been established at Kirby Misperton, North Yorkshire, at one of the wells where gas firm Third Energy has been given permission to start fracking. Guy Shrubsole, a Friends of the Earth campaigner, said he expected the move to search for shale gas under Sherwood Forest to become a new rallying point. He said: “I can’t think of anything more iconic in the English mindset to go for. You’d have thought they’d have learnt from the mistakes of some of the other fracking companies to avoid it, but they’ve gone straight for it.” Ineos told the Daily Telegraph that no decision had been made on whether fracking would go ahead under the national nature reserve, adding that “any decision to position a well site will take into account environmental features such as the Major Oak”. The firm’s shale operations director, Tom Pickering, said: “Potentially we in the UK have a huge supply of indigenous gas under our own feet. It would be simply crazy not to explore this natural resource.” However, Friends of the Earth fear that the seismic surveys alone could damage the forest, whose core is a site of special scientific interest, and its wildlife, which include rare bats and other protected species as well as ancient woodland. The Forestry commission has mandated that Ineos plants its charges at least 50 metres away from badgers’ setts and conservation sites. Ineos is a relatively new player in fracking, but was one of the big winners in the governmental handout of exploration licences, winning 21 of 159 awarded a year ago. The firm, founded by Jim Ratcliffe and with 17,000 employees worldwide, was welcomed back to the UK by the government last month as a “vote of confidence in the UK economy”, as it promised a $2bn (£1.6bn) investment in businesses including shale gas. Other moves by Ineos to conduct fracking surveys in Nottinghamshire have been rebuffed. The National Trust refused the firm permission to conduct surveys in Clumber Park, a few miles to the north of the forest.','https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/01/robin-hoods-sherwood-forest-faces-fracking-threat','Robin Hood\'s Sherwood Forest faces fracking threat',37),('commentisfree/2017/jan/01/algorithms-ai-artificial-intelligence-facebook-accountability','The past year marked the 60th year of artificial intelligence – and, boy, did it have a lively birthday. Pop open a computer science journal on your laptop during 2016 and you’d be assured that not only was progress happening, but it was doing so much, much faster than predicted. Today, AI and algorithms dominate our lives – from the way financial markets carry out trades to the discovery of new pharmaceutical drugs and the means by which we discover and consume our news. But, like any invisible authority, such systems should be open to scrutiny. Yet too often they are not open and we are not even fully aware that such systems play the roles they do. For years now, companies such as Amazon, Google and Facebook have personalised the information we are fed; combing through our “metadata” to choose items they think we are most likely to be interested in. This is in stark contrast to the early days of online anonymity when a popular New Yorker cartoon depicted a computer-using canine with the humorous tagline: “On the internet, nobody knows you’re a dog.” In 2017, not only do online companies know that we’re dogs, but also our breed and whether we prefer Bakers or Pedigree. The use of algorithms to control the way that we’re treated extends well beyond Google’s personalised search or Facebook’s customised news feed. Tech giants such as Cisco have explored the way in which the internet could be divided into groups of customers who would receive preferential download speeds based on their perceived value. Other companies promise to use breakthroughs in speech-recognition technology in call centres: sending customers through to people with a similar personality type to their own for more effective call resolution rates. It is a mistake to always decry this kind of personalisation as a negative. The futurist and writer Arthur C Clarke once noted that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Most of us will have had the awed feeling of watching a really good magic trick when their smartphone uninvitedly pops up a relevant piece of information at just the right moment – like your iPhone remembering where your car is parked. But the feeling is often tempered by a moment of doubt. Is it a bit creepy that Google knows your favourite football club? Are we being shown only the news that matches Facebook’s vision of who we are? Most of the time we don’t know because the algorithms’ internal workings remain inaccessible to us. The academic Sherry Turkle makes an interesting observation about PCs in the 1980s, when families started buying home computers and endless lines of green text gave way to sumptuous graphical user interfaces. At this point, she has suggested, computers moved from being a hobbyist machine you could open up and physically tinker with to a machine you could learn to operate immediately, even if you didn’t know exactly how it was working. Computers, Turkle playfully noted, begged to be taken not at face value but at interface value. It doesn’t take much to see that this philosophy has continued to develop over the years. This is particularly true when talking about artificial intelligence systems. Some of today’s most impressive advances in fields such as machine learning (the goal of getting a machine to, well, learn) rely on tools such as “deep learning neural networks”. These are systems patterned after the way the human brain works but which, ironically, are almost entirely inscrutable to humans. Trained with only inputs and outputs, and tweaking one or the other until the middle part “just works”, human creators have long since sacrificed understanding in favour of results. Since such tools will increasingly be used for more complex use-cases such as AI-driven warfare, prioritising patients in hospital and determining which areas of a city should be most heavily policed, questioning them is essential. We may view computers as coolly objective – hence the sci-fi trope of the machine that gains emotions and then goes wrong – but human bias and error can enter into algorithms, too. It’s when we believe that such systems are beyond question (and lack the means to question them if we change our mind) that things get problematic. So what’s the answer? This is a more complex challenge than many of the over-the-air quick fixes Silicon Valley loves to engage with. You can cut down on speech you don’t like on Twitter by banning people who say things you don’t agree with. That’s not so easy when the positives and negatives of technology are so deeply entwined. Technology in this sense is a bit like the political system: there are so many decisions to take that we hand the overwhelming majority of them to someone we trust. There is some evidence to suggest things are changing. The issue of AI accountability is shaping up to be one of this year’s hot topics, ethically and technologically. Recently, researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory published preliminary work on deep learning neural networks that can not only offer predictions and classifications, but also rationalise their decisions. Artificial intelligence achieved a lot in 2016. One of the goals in 2017 should be to make its workings more transparent. With plenty riding on it, this could be the year when, to coin a phrase, we begin to take back control.

It is a paradox that he is now heralded in some quarters as the global champion of all those causes, which everywhere seem under attack. The key to understanding this contradiction is that the pope is not himself a liberal. He is a conservative with a small c, mistrustful of all grand schemes of human betterment, whether socialist or libertarian, and he believes in sin and the devil – as do most of his 1.2 billion followers. If conservatism stands for anything more than the remorseless pursuit by the strong of their advantage over the weak, it is a profound suspicion of the human capacity to be good, a belief, as Milton put it, that we shall never cease “hammering from our flinty hearts the seeds and sparkles of new miseries for ourselves”. This isn’t the whole truth, but at a time when a world order seemingly based on rational self-interest is being consumed in greed and rage – including the “plague of terrorism” that Francis urged all to confront as it struck Turkey again – a little of Milton’s grim scepticism is salutary; even, almost, hopeful. For the pope, a world order based on the unlimited satisfaction of individual wants is unattainable, and the attempt to reach it destructive of the world around us, and of the peace of our inner worlds. As he wrote 18 months ago in his powerful encyclical on the environment: “When people become self-centred and self-enclosed, their greed increases. The emptier a person’s heart is, the more he or she needs things to buy, own and consume. It becomes almost impossible to accept the limits imposed by reality.” This attack was not confined to the one encyclical, but has been one of the most important themes of all his preaching, most recently in his New Year homily: “The lack of physical (and not virtual) contact is cauterising our hearts and making us lose the capacity for tenderness and wonder, for pity and compassion.” But, he continued, “we are not interchangeable items of merchandise or information processors. We are children, we are family, we are God’s People.” This is the development of a consistent line of Catholic criticism of the economist’s world that goes back at least​ as far as Pope Leo XIII’s 1891 Rerum Novarum, and arguably comes from the roots of western civilisation, in Aristotle and Aquinas. Catholic social teaching offers a coherent perspective on how the individual fits into society. It addresses directly the two great questions of our time: how the economy should be arranged to benefit everyone, and how our societies should treat the natural environment. Pope Francis has been an astonishingly eloquent advocate for human rights, for the environment, for peace and against the ravages of capitalism. He doesn’t do fluffy. In fact, at times, he sounds like a pure revolutionary. “We should be particularly indignant at the enormous inequalities in our midst,” he wrote in his 2015 encyclical. “We fail to see that some are mired in desperate and degrading poverty, with no way out, while others have not the faintest idea of what to do with their possessions, vainly showing off their supposed superiority and leaving behind them so much waste which, if it were the case everywhere, would destroy the planet. ... We continue to tolerate that some consider themselves more human than others.” With a passion perhaps possible only to a South American, he loathes the turbocharged US model of capitalism unleashed by Ronald Reagan: he entirely rejects the idea that greed restrained only by self-interest operating through a market will make the world just or good. His Catholicism is almost the polar opposite to the dominant strains of white American evangelical Christianity. He unequivocally opposes torture and the persecution of refugees, and even the death penalty, which are all causes dear to religious Republicans. More Americans support torture as an instrument of government policy than do the inhabitants of Iraq, Sudan or Afghanistan. With a series of dramatic gestures – visiting refugee camps; taking migrants into the Vatican; publicly washing the feet of a Muslim woman – the pope has demonstrated that he wants his church to stand alongside refugees and migrants. As archbishop of Buenos Aires he would visit the slums – and take a bus to get there. These are gestures eloquent of a much deeper intent. They set him against much of the modern world and the regimes in both Moscow and Washington. But they have also aroused bitter and well-funded opposition within his own church. The Vatican is a deeply and perhaps necessarily reactionary organisation, but an intelligent conservative like Pope Francis knows when times have changed and when to adapt. A reactionary confuses the present with the eternal, and thus can’t admit any change at all. The enemies around him Reactionaries must always lose in the long run. The world does change, and the change can’t be forever denied. But within the Catholic church they can and sometimes do manage to hold their positions for centuries. This is the dilemma that the pope faces as he tries to help the church come to terms with feminism. The Catholic church is a deeply patriarchal organisation: no one ever called a pope the Holy Mother; at the same time it is dependent on women whose work and devotion sustains the whole edifice. The concessions to feminism that he proposes don’t go as far as they might. He maintains the ban on women priests, and the complete opposition to abortion – although all priests may now forgive women who ask for it. But he has moved decisively to allow parishes to recognise some second marriages as real ones. He has been denounced for this by the reactionaries within the church as a heretic, a destructive progressive, and a man whose policies must lead to a historic schism and break with tradition. At the same time he has greatly disappointed progressives who had hoped for some shift in substance on the full acceptance of gay people and on the role of women in the church’s hierarchy. A champion of humanity Once more the apparent paradox dissolves in the light of the fact this is a conservative who believes that sin can corrupt anything, even, or perhaps especially, the church he heads. Church law and church rules can themselves become unrealistic schemes for organising society, as destructive in their dogmatic application as the precepts of Ayn Rand. His reactionary enemies, already praying and plotting for his succession, want a pope to proclaim “absolute moral norms that prohibit intrinsically evil acts and that are binding without exceptions” – which might sound reasonable until you realise they are not quoting a denunciation of war or slavery, but Pope John Paul II denouncing contraception. Yet in a world full of bewildering change, progressives as well as conservatives need to remember that moral absolutes exist and that there are some evils with which it is always wrong to compromise. Their form changes. A quarter of a century ago the Soviet Union fell. The attitudes that shaped the church then will not help it – or us – now. Global poverty, global greed, and the destruction of the environment are what threaten us today, and, however unlikely, Pope Francis is a champion of humanity against these evils.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/01/the-guardian-view-on-pope-francis-championing-humanity','The Guardian view on Pope Francis: championing humanity | Editorial',42),('commentisfree/2017/jan/02/trump-brexit-left-progressives-aghast-they-should-be-emboldened','In 2017, how might progressives win? Even posing the question feels odd – almost a category error – since “winning” scarcely exists as a referent in so much of progressive practice. The late Peter Cook used to perform a sketch in which he played a leftie working for the media empire of Lord Beaverbrook (think Rupert Murdoch). Cook assures his friend that he remains as radical as ever. “There are about 10 of us on the paper, young, progressive, liberal people who don’t believe a word we are writing, and whenever the old man has a party – a cocktail party – we all gather together down the far end of the room and drink as much as we can – we really knock it back – we drink and drink and drink – trying to break him from within; then – quite openly, behind our hands – we snigger at him.’ The friend looks doubtful: “Well, it doesn’t seem very much to me – sniggering and tittering.” “A titter there, a titter here,” says Cook. “It all adds up.” That’s very familiar today. On the left, we spend our time calling out and shutting down, lolling and meming and dropping mics. But winning? What does that even mean? Let’s put the problem another way. Traditionally, progressives defined themselves, at least in part, by a desire for change. The right defended the status quo; the left agitated to overthrow or at least ameliorate it. Progressives sought progress, movement, transformation, forcing the old to give to the new until we’d built a modern Jerusalem. The instability of 2016 will continue. You can feel it everywhere: all that is solid preparing to melt into air. With change so palpably afoot, this should be our time. So why isn’t it? In 1939, WH Auden wrote The Unknown Citizen to satirise the managerial revolution already then under way. Today, the poem reads like an eerie anticipation of liberal incredulity at Brexit and Trump and the other recent upheavals. Was he free? Was he happy? The question is absurd: Had anything been wrong, we should certainly have heard. In theory, progressives recognise the necessity of fundamental social change. In practice, we’ve responded to explosive manifestations of discontent with a mixture of fury and disbelief, aghast not just at the reactionary sentiments expressed but at the very existence of a dissatisfaction about which we knew nothing whatsoever. All over the world, pollsters report deep unhappiness with the institutions of liberal capitalism. Yet somehow the left – a movement dedicated to social transformation – has become the defender of a status quo that no one much else likes. Francis Adams was also a poet (though far less distinguished than Auden). In 1889, he explained his parallel career as an activist: “Five years ago, I broke up my health in the struggle then just beginning to organise the unskilled London labour. It seemed a failure. But I never despaired, or saw cause to despair. There was a splendid foundation of hate there. With hate, all things are possible.” It’s difficult to imagine a progressive saying that today: the formulation sounds more like a grab from one of those well-coiffured Nazi boys currently clinging to Trump’s coattails. Actually, though, Adams was a gentle and sensitive man, a rare opponent of the anti-Asian racism dominating the Australian labour movement. What he meant was that the London workers found their situation intolerable – and their justified anger fuelled the New Unionism that transformed British politics. Well, there’s a splendid foundation of hate today, too – and if we don’t build something positive from it, the edifices that will inevitably emerge will be very ugly indeed. Unfortunately, so much of what passes for activism now centres on an individualised moralism, less about changing the world than about making yourself feel (or perhaps sound) good while all about you everything remains exactly the same. In 1959, Raymond Williams described the seemingly insurmountable gulf between the progressive intellectuals of his day and the great bulk of the population. “Nothing,” he wrote, “has done more to sour the democratic idea among its natural supporters, and to drive them back into angry self-exile, than the plain, overwhelming cultural issues: the apparent division of our culture into, on the one hand, a remote and self-gracious sophistication, on the other hand, a doped mass.” Since, then, of course, that division has only widened. The academic Colin Crouch describes a tendency to “post-democracy”, in which “public electoral debate is a tightly controlled spectacle, managed by rival teams of professionals expert in the techniques of persuasion, and considering a small range of issues selected by those teams [while] the mass of citizens plays a passive, quiescent part, responding only to the signals given them.” We all know exactly what he means. But that’s why it’s worth rereading Williams. After all, many progressives reacted to Brexit and to Trump by demanding more rather than less state control over the citizenry. Aghast at the reactionary ideas that emerged during those votes (the misogyny, the xenophobia, the outright racism), they concluded that ordinary people couldn’t be trusted and needed better, more efficient management from the political class. To put it another way, confronted by widespread hatred for “post-democracy”, they doubled-down on the “post’ bit rather than the “democracy” aspect. Williams suggests a very different orientation. “So who then believes in democracy?” he asks. “The answer is really quite simple: the millions … who still haven’t got it where they work and feel. There, as always, is the transforming energy … ” He sees the resistance to top-down management, the desire for self-expression and self-determination in the workplace and the school and the home, as an opportunity for the left, not a threat. “The business of the socialist intellectual is what it always was: to attack the clamps on that energy – in industrial relations, public administration, education, for a start; to work in his own field on ways in which that energy, as released, can be concentrated and fertile.” It’s a challenging formulation as we approach 2017, flying in the face of what’s become progressive common sense: the condescending conviction that only enlightened liberal stewardship stands between civilisation and the hordes of tabloid-reading Morlocks. But Williams recognises that, too. “The technical means [of facilitating participatory democracy] are difficult enough,’ he says, “but the biggest difficulty is in accepting, deep in our minds, the values on which they depend: that the ordinary people should govern … ” That’s not to deny the genuinely disturbing racism manifesting in the US and across Europe. On the contrary, it’s to suggest a strategy – or at least the raw beginnings of one – to combat it. Williams’s point is that a left orienting to participation, to mass involvement and to democracy stands a better chance of overcoming the demagoguery of the far right through what he calls “the transforming energy” of the masses, since people exercising some control over their workplaces, their universities, their homes and cultural lives are less susceptible to the imaginary “solutions” of scapegoating and bigotry. No one can offer a blueprint for activism in 2017. The only certainty in times like this is that certainties will be confounded. Nonetheless, it’s difficult to believe that, in societies governed by some of the least popular leaders on record (from Trump to Turnbull), the next 12 months won’t bring further eruptions of discontent. How then will we respond? The temptation will be, once again, to defend liberal values by reinforcing the institutions of liberalism. But that’s not going to work. Quite simply, progressives must discover progress. Rather than buttressing a moribund status quo, the left needs to place itself on the side of change. That’s how we win – by reclaiming the notion of a better future from the reactionaries and demagogues.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/02/trump-brexit-left-progressives-aghast-they-should-be-emboldened','Trump and Brexit left progressives aghast.

But when Olivier Giroud blurred the line between the virtually real and the gloriously tangible, he did more than set Arsenal on their way to victory over Crystal Palace. He lit up the Emirates Stadium and provided a memory for years to come. Giroud’s 17th-minute opener recalled the finish of Henrikh Mkhitaryan for Manchester United against Sunderland on Boxing Day. There were shades of a scorpion kick, albeit with only one leg; a rainbow flick or whatever else the gamers want to call it. But when Giroud’s back-heeled flick – recalled from a distance behind him and on the run, too – arched in off the underside of Wayne Hennessey’s crossbar, the stadium and the watching TV millions felt their jaws drop. Even Giroud looked a little stunned. Arsenal coasted to the points thereafter, with Alex Iwobi providing the tempo and incision in the No10 role in the absence of Mesut Özil, who was ill. Iwobi added the second goal; a looping header after Palace had left him unmarked only four yards out. Palace’s defending continues to be a cause of high anxiety. Sam Allardyce’s team had a brief flurry around the hour mark but it was not an afternoon when the club’s new manager could trumpet too many positives with any conviction. It said much that he substituted Yohan Cabaye, Andros Townsend and Christian Benteke well before the end, with one eye, perhaps, on conserving energy for the home game against Swansea City on Tuesday. Giroud’s goal transcended the occasion and if the finish was a thing of exquisite class, it was worth going over every detail of the buildup, including the striker’s role in it, which was crucial. After Lucas Pérez – who looked off the pace on a rare Premier League start – had slid in to intercept on the edge of his own area, Héctor Bellerín initiated the break with a sharp pass up to Giroud but it was what happened next that really got Arsenal moving. With his first back-heel, he found Granit Xhaka and he played in Iwobi who, in turn, made the right pass forward to Alexis Sánchez. Giroud had bolted up in support but, when Sánchez’s cross arrived, it was a full yard behind him. No problem. Giroud adjusted his body shape and, in a moment of improvisational genius, he had reached back his left boot, located the ball and flicked it with his heel over his head and towards the roof of the net. Hennessey could do nothing to keep it out. The first thought was of Mkhitaryan but Giroud was further out than the United forward – he was about 12 yards from goal – and the goalkeeper had looked better placed. As the Arsenal supporters who filed past the press box were also keen to point out, Giroud was onside; Mkhitaryan had been just ahead of the last man. Whatever the arguments, it was plain that Giroud had illuminated this game to a degree that went beyond merely shaping it. In classic Giroud and Arsenal style, he had been guilty of a bad miss from an easier chance on seven minutes, after Xhaka’s dinked pass out to Nacho Monreal and the full-back’s low, first-time cross. In front of goal, Giroud could not set his feet in time and Mohamed Elneny’s follow-up shot was headed away by James Tomkins. Giroud had sorted himself out by the time that Sánchez crossed for him shortly afterwards. It was only Giroud’s second Premier League start of the season but he now has five goals in the competition and the statistics show that they have come at a rate of one every 69.8 minutes. The next best record in the top flight belongs to Watford’s Stefano Okaka, who has scored once every 97.5 minutes. Arsenal called the tune and it said everything that when Cabaye had a shot on target in the 37th minute, which was the definition of routine for the Arsenal goalkeeper, Petr Cech, the travelling fans celebrated wildly. “We’ve had a shot, we’ve had a shot,” they chorused, sarcastically. Palace’s chaotic streak at the back, which Allardyce has been charged with stamping out, was evident in first-half stoppage time, when a Bellerín cross sparked such panic that the only surprise was the Keystone Cops did not arrive on the scene. With Martin Kelly all over the place, Iwobi won the ball and Sánchez had a chance from close range. His shot, though, was too close to Hennessey, who blocked. Arsène Wenger would lament his team’s failure to kill the game sooner than they did. Palace were poor in possession in the first half but they had what Allardyce described as “our defining moment” on 47 minutes, when Townsend crossed for Benteke and one of the best headers of a ball in Europe found himself up against Bellerín at the far post. He failed to get a clean connection and the effort bobbled wide. The visitors had their purple patch after Iwobi’s goal, which followed Monreal’s cross and Scott Dann’s diversion high into the air. Benteke worked Cech with a header from a corner and Cabaye went close with the follow-up while Kelly swung and missed when well placed and Cech was made to save by Townsend. This game, however, was all about one player and one moment.','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/01/arsenal-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report','Olivier Giroud’s brilliant back-heel helps Arsenal sink Crystal Palace',49),('football/2017/jan/01/arsene-wenger-olivier-giroud-crystal-palace-work-of-art','Arsène Wenger described Olivier Giroud’s spectacular goal in Arsenal’s 2-0 home win against Crystal Palace as a work of art, and said it must rank in his all-time top five over his 20-year tenure at the club.

Alex Iwobi scored Arsenal’s second to crown an impressive individual display, which lifted his team back into third place in the Premier League, above Tottenham Hotspur, who had won 4-1 at Watford earlier in the day. But the occasion at the Emirates Stadium was all about Giroud’s moment of magic, which carried shades of Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s finish for Manchester United against Sunderland on Boxing Day. “It was an exceptional goal, because it was at the end of a fantastic collective movement, which is what our game is about,” Wenger said, with a nod towards the box-to-box counterattack. “After that, it was a reflex. Any goal-scorer is ready to take any part of his body, even if it’s the little toe, to score a goal and Olivier had that kind of reflex. He transformed that goal, I would say, into art. “It was art because of the surprise, because of the beauty of the movement and because of the efficiency of the movement. That will be remembered as the ‘Giroud goal’, which nobody will forget. Every striker is certainly remembered for one or two or three special goals and that will certainly remain with him forever. “Olivier brings the unexpected and we all come to football to get the unexpected. I have been spoiled in my career because I had many great strikers but that is certainly in my top five [of great goals].” Héctor Bellerín, the Arsenal right-back, said that he “couldn’t believe it” when the goal went in but Giroud was modest. “I have maximum luck,” he said. “I was off balance and I tried to deflect it – in this position, you can’t do something else. I’ve never done this before, so it’s all about luck. It’s a great feeling.” Wenger was asked to list the other goals in his top five and, off the top of his head, he actually named five. “I remember [Dennis] Bergkamp at Leicester and at Newcastle; Thierry Henry at Real Madrid and at Liverpool, and Kanu at Chelsea. It’s difficult for me to say, over 20 years, when we score about 70, 80 per year. By 20, it makes 1,600. It’s hard, in a second, to get the best five. “The importance of the game matters, and also when it’s 0-0. What is maybe not acknowledged enough by people, maybe even me, is that Olivier scores important goals. “He equalised at Man United this season [in the 89th minute] with the special header and he scored [the winner] against West Brom in the 86th minute. He scores goals that have weight in the result of the team.”','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/01/arsene-wenger-olivier-giroud-crystal-palace-work-of-art','Arsène Wenger calls Olivier Giroud goal against Crystal Palace ‘a work of art’',23),('football/2017/jan/01/bournemouth-arsenal-match-preview','Bournemouth brushed aside Swansea City on New Year’s Eve and return to home soil hoping to close out a team at the opposite end of the table, Arsenal.

Manager appeared to be sharing a joke with player, one he declined to expand on later, but their body language said it all. Smiles, a warm embrace, mutual bonhomie, and with regard to Costa the concrete sense that he is entering 2017 in a far happier mood than he did 2016. This time last year the forward was in the midst of a personal crisis, having scored just six times for a Chelsea side making a mockery of their status as league champions, and was spending more time picking fights with opposition players than terrorising them with his talents. Now he is the key figure of the team that sit six points clear at the top of the Premier League on the back of a record‑equalling 13-game winning run. Costa has 14 goals, making him the division’s top scorer, with his latest against Stoke City typifying the 28‑year‑old at his barnstorming, ruthless best, the man who spearheaded Chelsea’s title success of 2014-15 and appears ready to do so again. “The team has changed, not just me,” he said. “Last season we felt a frustration. We didn’t give the account of ourselves we should have done. We weren’t the team we should be. I wasn’t the player I should be. There were various issues but this season it has changed. The manager has come and applied his ideas. Things are going well.” Of that there is no doubt. Conte has revitalised Chelsea, tactically and in terms of their spirit, which could be seen at the weekend in what the Italian described as the toughest challenge his team have faced during their winning sequence. Stoke played with aggression and assurance and twice pegged back the hosts. But those in blue kept on believing, kept on driving forward, and eventually triumphed 4-2. It was fitting that Costa sealed the three points with the fourth goal, having delivered another fine front-man display. He was a constant menace and did not react to the rugged manner in which those in the visitors’ ranks, Ryan Shawcross in particular, looked to keep him at bay. Last season Costa would have lashed out – or accused Shawcross of smelling rotten, as he did when the pair clashed at the Britannia Stadium 14 months ago – but here he kept his calm, something he says is the result of accepting referees in this country are “against me” and: “If they’re not going to change, I had to change.” Eyebrows may well be raised at that statement and it’s worth noting that for all his “changes”, Costa has already served a one-match suspension this season. But he definitely seems calmer and he delivered the perfect response to Stoke’s attentions with a vicious strike past Lee Grant on 85 minutes having floored Bruno Martins Indi with brute strength and persistence. Costa has now been involved in 19 goals this season – more than any other player across Europe’s top five divisions. “Things are coming out well for me this season,” he said. “The truth is that the manager is good with the players, every time making jokes and that’s good for us, to have a manager who is not just a boss but a person we can talk to, someone whose support we can count on. We love him more all the time.” That love is clearly mutual – Conte describes Costa as an “important player”, and Chelsea fans may well shudder upon being reminded that the pair came close to not working together at Stamford Bridge. “Yes, yes, I was about to leave [in the summer],” said Costa. “I had the possibility of going back to Atlético [Madrid] because of a few things; the family, the life I have there. I wanted to change for family reasons but, well, it wasn’t to be and I continue to be happy here. “It was important that the manager from the very first minute said he counted on me.” Costa’s importance to Chelsea can be further seen in the fact his 14 league goals have come in 13 games. He has failed to score in only seven appearances in all competitions, and in only three of those did he complete 90 minutes. When Costa has played this season, he has tended to score. It should come as no surprise, then, that he is the latest figure to be linked with a move to China, with reports on Sunday claiming that Tianjin Quanjian are planning to make an £80m bid for the Brazil-born Spain international. Despite the size of the fee, it seems inconceivable Chelsea would sanction the move, and for Costa there must surely be the desire to see out a campaign in which he is on course to secure another Premier League winner’s medal and be named player of the year. As he said himself: “I am very happy, very content.” Chelsea’s collective focus now turns to visiting Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday and making history: no English club has won 14 successive top-flight games during a single campaign. Conte described the match as “the biggest challenge” Chelsea have faced since the first of their 13 victories – at Hull on 1 October – while from Costa came the insistence that the leaders are fully aware of what awaits them at White Hart Lane, a venue where they have not won since 2012. “It’s a London derby so the match is played a bit stronger,” he said. “But that’s no problem. We go there looking to do the best we can.”','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/01/diego-costa-antonio-conte-chelsea-premier-league','Diego Costa’s loving feeling keeps him firing for in-form Chelsea',7),('football/2017/jan/01/georginio-wijnaldum-urges-liverpool-step-up-pressure-on-chelsea','Georginio Wijnaldum has said it is essential Liverpool follow victory over Manchester City with another three points at Sunderland on Monday to increase the pressure on Premier League leaders Chelsea. Liverpool are the closest challengers to Antonio Conte’s side having moved four points ahead of City with a hard-fought win at Anfield on New Year’s Eve. Jürgen Klopp’s team, who remain six points behind the leaders, kick off at struggling Sunderland less than 44 hours after the conclusion of the City match and may be without their captain, Jordan Henderson, as well as the confirmed absentees Philippe Coutinho and Joël Matip. Henderson was withdrawn with a heel injury against Pep Guardiola’s team, although it is not the same heel that sidelined the midfielder for sustained spells last season. Chelsea do not play until Wednesday’s awkward assignment at Tottenham Hotspur and Wijnaldum, who secured Liverpool’s win over City with an outstanding header, believes Sunderland is an opportunity for Klopp’s team to pressure the leaders by cutting the gap to three points. The Holland international said: “You always have to put pressure on an opponent. We just have to win the game. Will it put pressure on them? I don’t know, maybe. Sunderland is a tough game as they also want to win because of the threat of relegation. Chelsea are flying right now and doing great but we have to focus on our own game and we will see if we come closer but the main thing is to keep doing what we are doing now, win our own games and not look at Chelsea because we don’t control that performance. “We have to give 100% and show how good we are. We can go far but we have to show it game by game. It is going well now but we don’t know how it will be going in two months so we must make sure we go all the time.” Klopp said it must be “annoying” for Chelsea to have won 13 league games in succession and find Liverpool still on their coat-tails, and Wijnaldum credited the manager for instilling in his players the belief to beat Guardiola’s expensively assembled side. “He just gives us confidence. In my opinion he does not do a lot special, just gives us the confidence we need, the confidence in our own quality and that we are a good team,” the midfielder explained. “He spoke in the team meeting and said, ‘We have to show our quality and show them how good you are.’ “I was not here before Klopp came so I can’t give my opinion on how the football has changed but in my opinion it is great to work under the manager. He gives players a happy feeling to play for Liverpool. What he wants is that we have joy in the things we do – training, games – and that is important for a footballer.” Wijnaldum also claimed Quincy Promes, his international team-mate, would succeed at Liverpool should Klopp develop his interest in the Spartak Moscow midfielder this month. “I think he knows how great Liverpool is, I knew it before I came here,” said the summer recruit from Newcastle United. “I don’t know if everything is true about what they say as I don’t speak with him about that. Of course I want him to come to Liverpool because I know he is a good player and also a good person who can help the team but it is something for the manager and the scouts, not for me.”','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/01/georginio-wijnaldum-urges-liverpool-step-up-pressure-on-chelsea','Georginio Wijnaldum urges Liverpool to step up pressure on Chelsea',9),('football/2017/jan/01/manchester-united-zlatan-ibrahimovic-critics-eat-their-balls-middlebrough-football','Zlatan Ibrahimovic believes his 17 goals for Manchester United have made his doubters “eat their balls” and that José Mourinho’s side can still win the title. Saturday’s 2-1 victory against Middlesbrough at Old Trafford was a fifth straight league win and takes United to 36 points, 13 behind the leaders, Chelsea, as they travel to West Ham United for Monday’s late afternoon kick-off. United needed goals from Anthony Martial and Paul Pogba on 85 and 86 minutes to overcome Grant Leadbitter’s strike with a quarter of the game to go but the home side felt they should have been ahead before half-time. Ibrahimovich had what appeared a legitimate finish struck off by the referee, Lee Mason, for his collision with Víctor Valdés despite this clearly occurring after the No9 made contact with the ball. The finish would have taken the Swede to 51 goals in 2016, level with Lionel Messi’s highest mark for the calendar year. Yet Ibrahimovic was content with the three points and in his own particular fashion took personal satisfaction from the stellar start to his United career after his summer move from Paris Saint-Germain. “I had a fantastic year, I am not complaining. I came to United, my first six months here has been more than amazing. I am super happy and let’s hope we can continue the ride and keep going. I feel good. I don’t know how many years I have left but I am enjoying the football. I came to the Premier League and everyone thought it would not be possible but like always I make them eat their balls.” Asked to explain this, the 35-year-old said: “It gives me a lot of energy, trust me. A lot of energy because they get paid to talk shit and I get paid to play with my feet, that’s how I enjoy it.” United are trying for a sixth consecutive league victory for the first time in two seasons. Ibrahimovich said of their form: “With every game you win, you get confidence. We haven’t lost for the last 10 games [actually 12], and it was important to win against Middlesbrough. We had to work hard for the win and the important thing is the three points because we want to come closer to the top and we are losing 1-0 and we should have had the goal, I scored. “Why he whistled, I don’t know. At first he gave the goal and after 30 seconds, he changed his mind. There was not a lot to speak to him because if you open your mouth, they give you a yellow and I was like: ‘Listen, you just took a goal from me, and now you want to give me a yellow card.’ OK, we keep playing and conceded a goal, it was easy for them and after we were working and then it was 1-1, and 2-1 within a minute. “That was not important – to level with Messi. The important thing was to win. For me the win is the same if I would beat Messi or not. Hopefully we can still win the league. We had our dips and we were winning and losing and winning and losing and hopefully the other teams can do some mistakes and we can close the gap closer and come into the top four.” Ibrahimovic has never played two matches in 48 hours, as he will do when lining up at West Ham, with Mourinho confirming he will start there. “It’s crazy,” said the centre-forward. “There is no superman, there is no strength that can recover from a game so fast and I cannot do nothing about it. If the coach wants me to play, I will play. But let’s be realistic, from a game you need to recover two or three days.” A happy Mourinho said: “Zlatan’s disappointed because in this moment he should be celebrating being top scorer in 2016. He did it. But he will start on Monday. You can tell [Slaven] Bilic that.” West Ham are 12th with 22 points after Saturday’s 1-0 defeat at Leicester City, who visit a Middlesbrough side four points above the drop zone on Monday. Leadbitter said: “We have a little league table that we want to finish top of, and that has to be our priority this season. One of the teams in that league is coming up on Monday at home and we have to look forward.”','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/01/manchester-united-zlatan-ibrahimovic-critics-eat-their-balls-middlebrough-football','Manchester United’s Ibrahimovic says he has made critics ‘eat their balls’',6),('football/2017/jan/01/mauricio-pochettino-spurs-chelsea-premier-league-white-hart-lane','Mauricio Pochettino wants to harness the sort of feeling that surrounded Leicester’s run to the title last season when Tottenham face the leaders Chelsea on Wednesday and believes the rest of the Premier League will be cheering for his team. Tottenham pulled to within 10 points of Antonio Conte’s team by defeating Watford 4-1 on Sunday. Pochettino suggested the chasing pack, led by Liverpool, who are six points behind Chelsea in second, will now will the home side to win at White Hart Lane, claiming that when Tottenham were fighting at the top with Leicester, it was their then-rivals who attracted similar goodwill. “Maybe we will feel how Leicester felt last season,” the Spurs manager said when asked whether he expects the likes of Liverpool and Arsenal to be rooting for Tottenham to stop what currently seems an irresistible force – Chelsea made it 13 wins in a row with a 4-2 triumph over Stoke on Saturday. “It was all the teams with them and against us. Maybe [Chelsea] will feel the same as us last season.” It is not an outlandish thought that a Tottenham win would bring them back into contention, such is their current level of performance, but Pochettino was keen to point out that the division as a whole might benefit from Chelsea’s winning run coming to an end. “Chelsea arrive in a very good shape, we too, and it will be a very tough game but a great opportunity for us to try and stop them and reduce the gap,” he said. “I think it is important for the Premier League and for us that we try and win. Then our challenge is to be in the top four.” The latter, at least, is reality at present and Pochettino was delighted with the performance that took Tottenham above Manchester City on goal difference. Two goals apiece from Harry Kane and Dele Alli saw Spurs record a fourth successive victory. “I think it was nearly a perfect game,” said Pochettino. “The shame was that we conceded a goal in the last minute but there were a lot of positive things and I’m very happy. Now we have two or three days to try and prepare in the best way for Chelsea.” Pochettino’s players adapted well to his switch to a three-man defence, a system he has felt comfortable using since the autumn, but he gave no hint that he would approach the Chelsea match – for which Kyle Walker and Jan Vertonghen are available after suspension – similarly. “We’ll see,” he said. “The formation we choose to play is not important – most important is the animation and how we move the ball. Today was a game where, from the outside, we can see the players were enjoying playing football on the pitch. Most important is the idea, the philosophy, and what we want to do with the ball – I think you give too much importance to the shape.”','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/01/mauricio-pochettino-spurs-chelsea-premier-league-white-hart-lane','Mauricio Pochettino reckons everyone else wants Spurs to beat Chelsea',29),('football/2017/jan/01/sam-allardyce-football-crystal-palace-manager-premier-league-fixture-sacked-arsenal','Sam Allardyce, after winning one point from his first two games in charge of Crystal Palace, has called for the Premier League fixture organiser to be “sacked”. The former England manager, who left his position with the national team after only one match following an undercover newspaper investigation, is now pointing the finger at fixture congestion. Yohan Cabaye, Christian Benteke and Andros Townsend were all substituted by Allardyce with Palace losing 2-0 at Arsenal on Sunday afternoon as the manager began to turn his attention to Tuesday’s home game with the bottom side Swansea City. “We’ve been dealt the blow of not having enough recovery time between now and Tuesday night, why can’t we play Wednesday?” asked Allardyce. “I don’t know who does the fixtures but he needs sacking really. “Swansea played yesterday, have 24 hours on us. They’re such big games with so much at stake, you want a fair crack at it, and it’s unfair when you’re playing [Sunday] and Tuesday night. I was disappointed in our first-half performance [against Arsenal]. “We gave much too good possession away. None more so than the [Giroud] goal. That was simple possession given away on one of our attacks in the first half. It was a brilliant piece of skill, how he took the goal, but our passing wasn’t good enough.” Allardyce is now looking to the transfer window to help out his Palace squad. “Two things [need] to happen for the team to get better and produce more results: get the team fitter and buy players in. Two if possible, three if the finances will allow,” he said. “I want to lift the squad. It lifted the whole place last year at Sunderland.”','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/01/sam-allardyce-football-crystal-palace-manager-premier-league-fixture-sacked-arsenal','Sam Allardyce says Premier League fixture organiser should be sacked',4),('football/2017/jan/01/stoke-city-jack-butland-miss-rest-season-ankle-injury','Mark Hughes has revealed that the Stoke City goalkeeper Jack Butland could miss the rest of the season due to the injury he sustained while playing for England 10 months ago. Butland fractured his right ankle close to half-time of the 3-2 victory over Germany in Berlin on 26 March. The player left on a stretcher and was forced to miss the European Championship in France. He was, however, expected to return for Stoke’s first Premier League match of the season, at Middlesbrough, but aggravated the ankle just 24 hours before that game and has suffered a number of setbacks to his recovery since. A further operation last month was intended to mean a return to action in March, but Hughes, speaking after Stoke’s 4-2 defeat at Chelsea on Saturday, and in the context of tieing up a long-term deal for loanee goalkeeper Lee Grant, said the 23-year-old may not play again during the current campaign. “That’s a priority for us because we’re in a little bit of a situation with Jack Butland being unavailable for any number of months and he might not come back this season,” said Hughes. “He may well get back April/May time, we’re not sure. But we’re more comfortable with his situation now and understand what the problems have been. So he’ll be fine when he gets back.” Butland was in excellent form for Stoke before his injury and was deemed a certain member of Roy Hodgson’s squad for Euro 2016. Sam Allardyce was also known to view Butland as a serious contender to Joe Hart as England’s No1 during his brief spell in charge of the national team. Having managed Butland while in charge of England Under-21s, Gareth Southgate may well be keen to involve him at senior level, and would have potentially been able to do so for the friendly away to Germany on 22 March and World Cup qualifier at home to Lithuania four days later. However, the earliest Southgate might be able to select Butland is likely to be for the qualifier against Scotland at Hampden Park on 10 June. In Butland’s absence, Grant, 33, has impressed following his arrival from Derby County at the end of August. He made another string of eye-catching saves at Stamford Bridge and is expected shortly to turn his loan deal into a transfer, thought to be in the region of £1.5m. Derby had originally wanted closer to £4m for the player. “We lost Jack the Friday before the first game of the season so had to move quickly,” said Hughes. “Thankfully our goalkeeping coach Andy Quy had worked with Lee at Derby, so he knew him. It was still a risk. He’d had 300-odd games at a good level but had never played in the Premier League. But credit to him, he’s proven he’s a Premier League keeper.”','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/01/stoke-city-jack-butland-miss-rest-season-ankle-injury','Stoke’s Jack Butland could miss rest of season with ankle injury',8),('football/2017/jan/01/stoke-city-watford-match-preview','There has been little festive cheer for Stoke after the fixture computer handed them trips to Anfield and Stamford Bridge in between Christmas and new year and despite flattering to deceive before losing both games, the visit of Watford gives them a chance to end on a high.

The Frenchman has found himself down the pecking order in recent months, demoted to second choice as collateral damage to Alexis Sánchez’s reinvention as a spiky central striker. One thing does seem certain, though. Whatever direction Giroud’s strangely divisive five-year Arsenal career takes from here, however the club’s hotly-contested modern history ends up remembering him, he is unlikely to have a better moment, in isolation, than the opening goal here. Olivier, old boy, we’ll always have Palace. What are we calling it then? A Henrikh? A studs-up, reach-back semi-scorpion? Perhaps the greatest no-look donkey-kick breakaway volley you’re likely to see outside the pixelated world of early 1990s arcade machines? Certainly Henrikh Mkhitaryan does seem have been on to something with his discovery of the sole-of-the-boot, reach-around volley. Giroud’s version, the opener in this 2-0 defeat of a disappointing Crystal Palace, was even better. The build-up was wonderfully slick. Lucas Pérez won the ball and slipped it to Héctor Bellerín. Giroud’s back-heel found Granit Xhaka, who passed to Alex Iwobi. He did exactly the right thing at exactly the right speed, driving forward and zipping an instant pass to Sánchez. Sánchez paused, looked up and floated a cross just behind Giroud as he rumbled into the box. Hmmm. What to do now? Hang on. In a moment of extreme, imaginative spatial awareness Giroud stretched his left foot up behind his shoulder and sent the ball arcing off his studs past his own left ear and over Wayne Hennessey. With an added gloss the ball even had the presence of mind to clang in off the underside of the crossbar, thereby adding a 20% premium on goal of the season scores, a principle known as Yeboah’s Law. Giroud, charming as ever, laughed afterwards and said his finish was lucky, that he was off balance and just made something up in the moment. It was certainly a fluke in the sense that nobody could realistically hope to do it again. As the ball crossed the line there was an odd moment of hush around the Emirates, the air seeming to disappear out of the stadium then rush back in with a gulp at the pure audacity of a moment that had little in common with the angsty bustle that made up most of the opening 45 minutes. Or indeed little in common with the recent trajectory of Giroud’s Arsenal career. The absence from recent starting XIs is a consequence in part of his own late return from the Euro 2016 final. But Giroud remains an oddly divisive figure, a cumbersome No9 who can look both immobile and also razor sharp, blunt and brilliantly bullish, at times all within the same attack. His start here was just his second in the league this season. Arsenal have looked sharper and more direct in his absence. But he still has six Premier League goals in his last four starts, albeit across seven months since the end of last season. Indeed, his goalscoring record is good throughout his entire time at Arsenal, even if the impression remains of a fine plan B dressed up in the ill-fitting tinsel of a first choice A-lister. The transition from Robin van Persie, a glistening, pedigree, title-winning striker replaced by a hopeful workhorse seemed to sum up, for some, the frustrations of the late austerity years. Giroud scores at a similar rate to the man he replaced. But critics will say he just doesn’t seem to do so at the right time, or against the right teams, or with the right degree of match-sealing elan. Shortly before his goal here he missed an absolute sitter, failing to connect in front of goal as Nacho Monreal flashed a volleyed cross though the six-yard box. The ball was skimming and slick on the surface. But being in place to prod those in is pretty much the job, not the one-off worldie back-flick stuff. In one sense even that wondrous opening goal was simply a large, quite slow man falling over to brilliant effect, a moment of pub-football art. Giroud’s own reaction was lovely, pure joy but also laughter. In the seats the home fans also giggled and danced and hugged rather than just punching the air and acting as though this was anything other than an isolated moment of extreme skill, plus an indication of the basic fun, the occasional silliness of sport. Arsenal scored again on 56 minutes, this time through a well-placed header from Iwobi. Giroud’s moment aside Iwobi was their best player and most significant presence. Given a chance to play at No10 in Mesut Özil’s absence through illness, Iwobi had a fine game. Socks half-rolled down, not exactly quick but persistent, not exactly powerful but tenacious, he was careful with the ball, and always looking to drive forward and inflict pain on the Palace defence. Arsène Wenger was generous in his praise afterwards. Seasons rarely turn on fine moments, and Arsenal’s fans will take just as much heart form Iwobi’s craft as they will from a goal that will live long in the memory.','https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/jan/01/donkey-scorpion-olivier-giroud-volley-arsenal-crystal-palace','Donkey or scorpion? Olivier Giroud’s volley defies classification | Barney Ronay',21),('football/blog/2017/jan/01/love-hate-january-transfer-window','And so it begins … again. A rolling, meandering soap opera that never really stops started in earnest on Sunday as the new year heralded the opening of the January transfer window. An often tedious month-long orgy of will-they won’t-they drama, whisper and counter-whisper, unhappy Arsenal fans and sightings of Robert Snodgrass, it slowly builds to a climactic all-singing, all-dancing Sky Sports show-stopper hosted by an enthusiastic Scotsman who wears a yellow tie. We have been here before, many times. Fourteen, to be precise. Made compulsory by Fifa for the 2002-03 season, the January transfer window is one of two registration periods in which Premier League clubs are permitted to buy players they may or may not have been linked with by assorted TV and radio shows, newspaper gossip columns, football websites and social media accounts run by teenage schoolboys from football hotbeds such as Ludlow and Stow-on-the-Wold. Originally introduced as part of a compromise with the European Commission in order to preserve contractual stability for footballers and clubs while simultaneously allowing movement of the former at certain times of the year, the January window has since eclipsed the League Cup to become the third biggest competition in English football. The inaugural window was “won” by Birmingham City, who signed the World Cup and European Championship-winning striker Christophe Dugarry on loan from Bordeaux and ensured their Premier League survival with the help of four goals from the Frenchman in their final five matches of that season. And two years ago Crystal Palace came up trumps by paying just £6.8m to Manchester United to re-sign Wilfried Zaha, a fine, if occasionally gravitationally challenged, winger who recently made headlines after becoming embroiled in a disagreement with a man dressed as a giant hornet. When first mooted by Fifa in the early 1990s, the idea of introducing transfer windows received almost unanimous backing from English football’s overlords, who – rather naively, it turned out – hoped they might help reduce the often disruptive influence of nefarious agents around football clubs. In May 2002, however, the Premier League and Football League joined forces to fight against the imposition of domestic transfer windows due to the financial implications they might have in the wake of that year’s ITV Digital fiasco. “We have charged the FA with responsibility to use the position and influence they have on Fifa committees and as a national association, to mount a full-blooded lobbying campaign to get these rules changed,” thundered a Premier League spokesman at the time, before what is perhaps the only recorded historical example of his august employers failing to get their own way. As well as Dugarry, the first January window marked the arrival of cult hero Yakubu Aiyegbeni in England following his move from Maccabi Haifa to Portsmouth. The departure of Jonathan Woodgate from Leeds to Newcastle also made headlines, as did Robbie Fowler’s move from Leeds United to Manchester City. In total, Premier League clubs spent £35m between them in that particular window, coincidentally the same amount Liverpool would pay Newcastle for Andy Carroll in January 2011 and £95m less than the clubs of the top flight spent this time last year. Twelve months ago, some wildly excitable soothsayers predicted that Premier League clubs would spend more than £1bn in January, but they eventually coughed up a comparative pittance of £130m. Despite the frenzied excitement it prompts among football fans, the January window is not without its critics. Arsène Wenger and Harry Redknapp are among them, the former known for his extreme frugality, while the latter has long been a reluctant poster-boy and punchline for the often ill-advised wheeler-dealing and horse-trading for which this time of year is increasingly renowned. Famous for his out-of-the-car-window appraisals of assorted “triffic” targets on Sky Sports News, Redknapp was more enthusiastic than most when it came to January panic buys during his time as a manager, but claimed – in the face of all evidence to the contrary – not to enjoy the mayhem of the mid-season livestock mart. Three years ago, he likened that year’s January window to “gang warfare”, saying “every agent seems to be trying to screw each other” in the scramble for money. A few days later, Harry was involved in one of the great deadline day farces. Having driven down to London from the Midlands in what his then manager Steve Clarke described as “an act of total lunacy”, a forlorn and frustrated Peter Odemwingie was left sitting and seething outside Loftus Road in his parked car as West Brom and Redknapp’s QPR failed to agree terms on his transfer. Despite the suspicions of some Arsenal fans who may not be aware of its existence, Wenger has long been critical of the January window, stating it is “unfair”, because championship rivals from the same league can move players between them in a premeditated bid to undermine his team. As conspiracy theories go it’s a mite tinpot and tenuous, but there can be no doubt the current system is far from perfect. With teams scrapping around the foot of the table, the January window breeds no end of panic and desperation while allowing big clubs to unsettle the better players at struggling sides before poaching them. Long may it continue; after 14 years we wouldn’t have it any other way.','https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/jan/01/love-hate-january-transfer-window','Love it or hate it, the January transfer window provides unique excitement | Barry Glendenning',13),('football/blog/2017/jan/01/pressure-grows-on-pep-guardiola-manchester-city-toil','Pep Guardiola wished the assembled media a happy new year at the start of his post-match press conference and extended the seasonal goodwill message to their families when he left the Anfield stage. It was a nice touch by the Manchester City manager but the niceties were part of a performance better than that produced by his team at Liverpool and exposed by an angry, exasperated exchange with Txiki Begiristain shortly afterwards. There was no goodwill to be found in defeat by Jürgen Klopp and falling 10 points adrift of Chelsea, the leaders. Press duties completed, Guardiola headed back to the makeshift dressing rooms in the bowels of Anfield’s new main stand where he met Begiristain, City’s director of football and a man with some serious questions to answer over the club’s expensive and erratic recruitment drive. Guardiola, pacing up and down, scratched his head, pulled at his tie and began punching his fist into the palm of his hand as he dissected City’s display with his former Barcelona colleague. They have trailed and recovered before but that was at a club attuned to Guardiola’s methods and vice-versa. A revealing glimpse into genuine frustration and the performance that provoked it were reminders of how much work is required to recreate that understanding at the Etihad Stadium. “The manager was angry at half‑time,” Yaya Touré admitted. “When you are losing like that and Liverpool are the better side then it’s not going to be happy at half-time. It was disappointing and we all felt that. Of course he is going to be angry. He is a manager who can be angry. We have to sometimes improve and react to situations, and of course we knew Liverpool would be waiting when we lost the ball and they did that to score. So he will be angry for everything that is happening. “We are not going to be perfect. There are times when we won’t take opportunities but we can take opportunities from this too. Anfield is not easy but we can learn from this and what the manager says about it. When you lose games, what do you have to do? You are disappointed and you want to bounce back. We don’t want to let the gap grow much more between us and Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham. So we have to react. We will use it – we are not going to give up. We will go to the&nbsp;end.” Touré and co responded to their manager’s criticism, controlling possession in the second half and forcing Liverpool into a retreat when David Silva switched to the centre in place of the subdued Kevin De Bruyne, but not to the extent of creating one chance of note. Klopp’s team were restricted as an attacking threat, too, but having punished City’s weakness in the air early, when Georginio Wijnaldum produced an outstanding leap and header to convert Adam Lallana’s eighth-minute cross, their compact shape held firm. The Liverpool manager had bemoaned the freedom with which Joe Allen roamed between his midfield and defence in their previous outing, against Stoke City. He ensured there was no repeat against Manchester City with a more protective midfield trio of Wijnaldum, Jordan Henderson and Emre Can. Raheem Sterling, fading amid the hostility that greeted his latest return to Anfield, De Bruyne, Silva, in the first half, and Sergio Agüero, throughout his first appearance in 28 days, were comprehensively shackled. Klopp had the answers to City’s array of individual talents. His team have collected 13 points from 18 while Philippe Coutinho has been injured and, as the Brazilian nears fitness, so Liverpool have emerged as formidable challengers to Chelsea. Klopp said it must be annoying for Antonio Conte’s team to have won 13 consecutive league games and still found Liverpool hanging on six points behind. Equally, how annoying must it be to have won 12 of the last 16 league games and sit second? “We came from eighth position last year so we don’t think about being champion or whatever this year, but we are much better than last year and the position is completely different,” said Klopp. “We are fine. If anyone else thought we had to be champion this year then maybe it seems different to them but we are fine. We are where we are and if it ends there then cool. “If we are still there five matches before the end and are only a few points behind then we will think about something else but not in this moment. I’m not like this. I have had much more difficult situations in my life than being second in a very difficult league. We are happy about our way and what the rest is doing we can have no influence on until we play them. That’s all we can do. I’m not annoyed. Not for one second. “I won a league twice and I honestly didn’t think about the opportunity until really late. We have targets. We are ambitious. You saw it again against City how ambitious the boys are but talking about it doesn’t bring you one point. You have to work. When you see the final line and if you are still in and around then the pressure will increase. You could see the pressure here – not because we didn’t want to lose the game but because we wanted to win it. That is really pressure against a very good side. You do the analysis and think: ‘Oh my God, I don’t want to show the boys all of this because they are a really good side.’ I know there is criticism of their defending or whatever but they play some of the best football in the world and you have to defend it. We did it. I’m happy with our situation in the table at the moment.” Klopp can be content not only with Liverpool’s league position but how his team have developed rapidly according to his managerial ideals. Guardiola, between the new year wishes, admitted he is unsure when City will do likewise. “I don’t know, I’m not able to tell you that,” he said. “Jürgen is here more than one season, more than one year. I’ve been here just six months and the way we want to play in the league is not that simple. We need a little bit more time but I’m a guy who is so optimistic and we’re going to try.”','https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/jan/01/pressure-grows-on-pep-guardiola-manchester-city-toil','Pep Guardiola feels pressure as tempers fray and Manchester City toil | Andy Hunter',5),('media/2017/jan/01/watership-down-was-no-utopia-for-the-does','Trevor Masters (Reasons to be cheerful about the world in 2016, Letters, 31 December) thanks the Guardian for being here to help us retain our sanity in the coming year, and cites examples of content to back up the claim.

For the way forward is not one nationwide progressive alliance, but rather multiple progressive alliances. To achieve an overarching national agreement is probably impossible. But progressive alliances can and already are forming – in individual parliamentary seats, across counties, across cities, sometimes at a council level, sometimes at parliamentary level. They’ll have different compositions in different places, according to local circumstances, but will be all the stronger for that, and more resilient. If talks break down or promises are broken in one place, it won’t bring the whole edifice down. As for what it is for: getting rid of the Tories is a worthy goal, but a bigger, and even more important, prize is getting a fair voting system; electoral reform that will finally give Britain a democracy, a government that reflects the will of the people. Neatly, that would then remove the need for electoral alliances, for a PR-majority parliament, with a genuine will to act, only needs to be achieved once. That’s a prize worth sacrifice and political pain along the way.

In her video message May acknowledged how divisive June’s referendum had been and said both sides would be in her mind as she prepared to trigger article 50. “I am there to get the right deal not just for those who voted to leave, but for every single person in this country,” she said, counter to recent hints that the government is preparing a hard Brexit, which would see the country leave both the customs union and the single market. Farron, whose party is campaigning for a second referendum on any exit deal finalised with the EU, said: “After months of platitudes and driving us headlong towards a hard Brexit out of the single market, threatening jobs and our economic security, a few empty words are utterly meaningless. “If the prime minister cannot even deliver on the words she gave when she campaigned for remain, why should we believe her now? In all of this she has Labour holding her hand, marching towards a disastrous Brexit.” In recent days, leave campaigners have stepped up efforts to push for what they term a “clean break’ with Brussels, with the UK cutting all formal ties with the bloc.

There might have been some truth in it then but, these days, gold prospectors could do better by sampling termite mounds and leaves from acacia trees. New research in Western Australia reveals where remaining gold deposits might be hiding. Across the world, most of the easy gold (outcropping at the Earth’s surface) has already been found and gold miners have to be a bit more cunning. One area that hasn’t been searched thoroughly is underneath sediments and soils. But how does a modern gold prospector know where to start digging? Ravi Anand, from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), and his colleagues gathered hundreds of samples of sediments, soil and acacia leaves from Moolart Well gold deposit, 400km north-east of Kalgoorlie. After analysing the gold content of all the samples they showed that clusters of gold occurred in zones rich in organic carbon (carbon derived from living material). Their findings are published in Geology. Anand and his colleagues believe that much of the gold in the older sediments came from underlying gold-bearing rock, via chemical and biological processes when the climate was humid. Subsequently, gold was transferred into younger sediments by the action of burrowing creatures, erosion and flooding, during the dry climate phase of the past few million years. The samples from termite mounds and acacia leaves reveal that gold is preferentially absorbed by living material, and suggests that digging deep under gold-rich trees and mounds could lead to veins of gold.','https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jan/01/gold-western-australia-miners-termites-acacia-trees-terrawatch','Look to the leaves for clues to gold deposits',16),('science/2017/jan/01/the-january-night-sky-meteors-planets-moon-stars-starwatch','The crescent Moon stands between the brilliant evening star Venus and the much fainter Mars on the 2nd.

What conceivable rationale is there for engaging very young children with ICT screen technologies when it will inappropriately accelerate early child development, distort the natural development of the young child’s delicate growing senses and displace equivalent learning achievable through real, embodied human interaction? We’ve no idea what the long-term neurological, social and emotional impacts will be of exposing children to ubiquitous screen technologies; and until we do, a responsible precautionary principle is urgently called for, with any guidelines being evidence-based and grounded in reputable research.

A fifth of babies do not receive the recommended reviews after they turn one, and one in four miss out at the age of two, according to the government’s commission on social mobility. Health visitors, responsible for assessing a child’s early years development, are supposed to carry out checks straight after birth, at six to eight weeks, at one year and then at between two and two-and-a-half years. However, the commission found that one in five children had not received the mandatory 12-month check by the time they reached 15 months old. London children were the least likely to receive the right number of health visits, the report found, with fewer than half receiving the final two checkups. A survey of parents found that the vast majority wanted the health visits to continue, with just 5% saying they did not feel they required advice during their first six months as a parent. “Despite the conventional wisdom that parents fear interference from the ‘nanny state’, in reality many say that they welcome advice in the early years of their child’s life,” the commission said. It said it was concerning that one in four two-year-olds did not have their health and education needs reviewed by a professional. “Despite this being a crucial period for families, there is still too little support for parents in the earliest stage of their child’s life. With the socioeconomic gap in outcomes emerging early, providing support to parents at this point could reap dividends for social mobility later on in life.” The Conservative party’s 2010 manifesto included a key pledge to increase the number of health visitors. NHS Digital figures show the number of full-time or equivalent health visitors in England fell by almost 1,000 between October 2015 and August 2016. In December a survey of health visitors by the Institute of Health Visiting found that 85% of respondents felt their workload had increased in the last two years. Some were having to look after between 500 and 1,000 children, when the maximum recommended is 250. Labour said the commission’s figures showed the government was failing to invest in early years support. Emma Lewell-Buck, the shadow minister for children and families, said: “Becoming a parent for the first time is an exciting but scary time and it is shocking that not all parents are getting the support they need. “The Tories promised more health visitors by taking away money from Sure Start Centres. Six years later we have lost over 700 centres and we are still waiting for the health visitors. The Tories have completely failed to invest these crucial early years.” A spokesperson for Public Health England said: “Ensuring every child has the best start in life is one of our key priorities. We are supporting local authorities in commissioning services that support families and provide early help when needed. “We are also working with councils to give health visitors professional guidance and leadership, as well as evidence of what works, to help them meet their public health responsibilities.” The commission also said parents were finding it more difficult to access local children’s centre services, citing a 2015 survey which found more than 60% of children’s centre managers said they were cutting back on services to meet their budgets. Government figures in December revealed that 156 Sure Start children’s centres had closed in England in 2015, almost double the number in the previous year.','https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/01/one-in-four-babies-miss-out-on-health-visitor-checks-social-mobility-commission','One in four UK babies miss out on health visitor checks',14),('society/2017/jan/01/richard-baker-obituary','My husband Richard Baker, who has died aged 66 of cancer, was a sailor, museum attendant, writer and gardener and, for more than 30 years, lead builder of the Skinningrove bonfire, east Cleveland. Thousands flocked annually to his beautiful, enormous sculptures of dinosaurs, goblins, ships, castles and more, built from scrap wood at this spectacular community event. Richard invited contributions from everyone, whatever their abilities, encouraging people to value their addition, as he did. When darkness falls on Skinningrove each 5 November, this huge fire is a magical sight. In 2015, it featured as the Guardian’s Picture of the Day. The son of a naval officer, Christopher Baker, and his wife, Jean (nee Crabtree), Richard was born in Dunfermline when his father was stationed at Limekilns. When his father was posted to New Zealand, the family spent three years living near Takapuna beach. They returned to Blakeney, Norfolk, and then settled in nearby Cley. Richard went to school in Blickling, then boarded at King Edward VII grammar school, King’s Lynn, before embarking on a degress in English and American studies at Nottingham University. On graduating he became a contributor to alternative publications and later he wrote about English street life, using Hogarth’s drawings as his starting point. Richard and I met in 1974 at Theatre Centre, Kensal Green, north-west London, where we were both community arts workers. We were briefly engaged in that year, but did not marry until 2003. Between 1979 and 1993 we were based in Stockton-on-Tees and began visiting Whitby, which we grew to love. We started the Skinningrove bonfire along with local people in 1980. When my work took me around the country, Richard would often find new things to do too. He was, by turns, a proofreader, shepherd, barman, beach cleaner, clown, busker, musician, roadie, gardener and maker of giant puppets. In 1993, we moved to Dawlish, in Devon, but continued to return to the north-east to build the bonfire. We finally retired to Whitby in 2007. Richard was a well-known Church Street character and guide on ghost walks; he was in his element as a performing storyteller. He also worked in the Captain Cook Memorial Museum. When he saw the replica ship HM Bark Endeavour on its return to Britain in 1997 it was love at first sight.

Dr Helen Stokes-Lampard condemned the policy, a key Conservative pledge, as unrealistic and said it was ignoring the lack of demand among patients to see GPs at weekends and a serious shortage of family doctors. The government has promised to ensure that people in every part of England will be able to see a GP from 8am to 8pm every day of the week by 2020 as a key element of its push to create a “truly seven-day NHS” by the end of the current parliament. “It’s unrealistic in the current climate. We haven’t got the people, we haven’t got the resources. If you give people access on a Sunday afternoon they’re not going to have access on a Tuesday morning. They can’t have it all”, the chair of the Royal College of GPs said in an interview. Calling for surgeries weekend opening to be restricted to Saturday mornings, Stokes-Lampard said: “We should be responding to what is needed in an area, and balance that realistically by what can be provided safely. Because quite frankly if you open on a Sunday afternoon but you’re closed on a Tuesday morning, who’s going to benefit?. There is so little demand from patients to see a GP on Sundays that plans to compel at least one surgery in each area to open on that day by 2020 should be dropped, she said. Nor do many people want to attend a surgery on a Saturday afternoon, she added. David Cameron pledged access to GPs from 8am to 8pm seven days a week at the Conservative party conference in 2014, and established a £50m “challenge fund” to deliver it. Some surgeries that have begun opening at weekends, however, have scrapped their experiment because of the small numbers of patients seeking appointments on Saturdays and Sundays. A relentless rise in the need for care is prompting more GPs to retire early or move abroad, leaving the profession facing a growing workforce crisis and patients facing long waits for appointments, Stokes-Lampard said. As a result “we’re layered too thin at the moment, we’re spread too thin. We can’t sustain a good five-day service at the moment, a seven-day service is unrealistic. If we can’t provide eight to six Monday to Friday because we’re stretched to breaking point, we’re certainly not going to be able to provide seven days a week.” She said general practice was “closer to the edge than it has ever been in living memory”, and cast serious doubt on ministers being able to fulfil another key NHS pledge – to increase the number of GPs in England by 5,000 by 2020 compared with 2015. It will be very hard to deliver that number without many GPs coming from overseas or former doctors being persuaded back into work, she said. The Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb, who was a coalition health minister until May 2015, denounced the pledge of access to GPs all day and every day as a “superficially attractive gimmick”. “This target is driven by seductive headlines, not sound policy. It will distort priorities and resources away from action which could make a real difference to people’s lives, such as ensuring that people have both their physical and mental health needs effectively met in primary care,” he said. “No one believes that there will be sufficient resources to deliver this plan. The risk is that it will leave dangerous gaps in provision during the week. “Pursuing superficially attractive gimmicks like this amounts to a smokescreen for the dire threat the NHS and care system now faces as it is starved of the resources it needs to provide effective, prompt and safe care.” The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: “These serious doubts about a flagship government pledge will raise widespread concerns. It’s yet another warning about the scale of the underfunding and understaffing now impacting our NHS. “In her six months as prime minister Theresa May has shown no regard for the state of the NHS, so it’s no surprise it now looks like her own manifesto commitments will be broken. “But in 2017 the government simply must not carry on ignoring the warnings. Instead they need to come forward with a genuine plan to give the NHS and social care the resources they need to deliver the very best care every patient deserves.” The Department of Health insisted the government would achieve its ambition of seven-day opening, and that the policy was popular. “This is a common sense reform with wide public support, and one we will deliver”, a spokeswoman said. “People don’t just get ill Monday to Friday, nine to five, and 18 million patients now have weekend and extended access to a GP, which has already shown evidence of relieving pressure on other parts of the NHS. “To deliver our pledge, we are putting an extra £2.4bn into GP services, which will help expand the workforce.”','https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/01/seven-day-nhs-plan-puts-weekday-surgeries-at-risk-warns-top-gp','Seven-day NHS plan puts weekday surgeries at risk, warns top GP',24),('sport/2017/jan/01/gary-anderson-peter-wright-pdc-world-darts-championship','Gary Anderson is one game from true greatness. Only Phil Taylor and Eric Bristow have won three consecutive world championships, but Anderson has the chance to join that club after an ultimately comfortable 6-3 win over Peter Wright in the semi-final. It was his 17th victory in a row at Alexandra Palace, and he has the aura to match. For so long Anderson was the underachieving genius of darts. He won his first world title two years ago at the age of 44, beating Phil Taylor 7-6 in a classic final, and followed up by retaining his title with formidable authority a year ago. Once he struggled under extreme pressure; now he is a big-game specialist, who saves his best darts for the biggest tournament of all. Anderson was never behind in a contest that was both high-class and nervy: the scoring was relentless, with 25 180s, yet both players were unusually fragile on doubles. Wright came back from 3-1 to 3-3 before Anderson ran away with the match by taking the final eight legs. There was not much between the two but the timing of Anderson’s big scores and big finishes – particularly a 157 to stop Wright’s fightback and go 4-3 up – was decisive. “I’m very proud of winning the world championship twice,” said Anderson. “This year I just wanted to get past the first round and see what happens. The crowd have been amazing. I feel comfortable up here, for some strange reason. I knew I was scoring well – the 180s are back – and although I missed a few doubles I was glad to get over the line. I don’t want to give the title up.” In the previous two rounds Anderson survived ferocious assaults from Benito van de Pas of the Netherlands and Dave Chisnall from St Helens. It was expected that he would get an even greater test from Wright, the world No3 who was playing beautifully. It is a reflection of the monstrous standard of modern darts that although Anderson and Wright averaged 103.45 and 99.83 respectively, it felt like the two Scotsmen were not at their best. Wright had taken out 53% of his doubles in the tournament; against Anderson that figure dropped to 30. It was an insurmountable malfunction. He started the match with a 180 only to miss six darts at the double to win the first leg. It set the tone for a traumatic start. By the time Wright hit a double at the 11th attempt, Anderson was well on the way to a 2-0 lead. Wright had darts to win four of the first five legs but lost the lot; and when he dragged the second set back to 2-2, Anderson threw six perfect darts to extinguish any hope. When the fourth set also went to a decider on the Anderson throw, he hit consecutive 180s once again. At that stage he seemed in complete control, only for Wright to drag the match back to 3-3 with a break in the sixth set. Anderson missed two darts to win both the fifth and sixth sets. He did not make the same mistake in the seventh. With Wright waiting on 70 – and with the darts should the set go to a fifth leg – Anderson took out a devastating 157. It was a hold of throw but a break of Wright’s spirit. He did not win another leg as Anderson stormed through the last two sets. “I’ve got no excuse, I didn’t play well enough,” said Wright. “I didn’t feel comfortable on the stage. My first dart wasn’t going in the treble 20, and that makes it really difficult. I really struggled to get the pitch of my darts right. And then when he gave me chances at doubles, I missed them as well. I’ve only been playing with these darts since mid-November so I’ll get better. Once I win a major I’ll win a few. Gary took care of me tonight and beat me up, and I hope he wins his third world title.”','https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/01/gary-anderson-peter-wright-pdc-world-darts-championship','Gary Anderson sees off Peter Wright to stay on track for PDC World Darts treble',10),('sport/2017/jan/01/gloucester-northampton-premiership-match-report','The new year does not always guarantee a fresh start but Northampton may at least feel that their luck is turning. A match they rarely looked like winning was gifted to them when Gloucester’s David Halaifonua was sent to the sin-bin for a deliberate knock-on and the Saints awarded a penalty try seven minutes from time. Stephen Myler could not miss the conversion on his 300th Northampton appearance but for Gloucester, who were leading by six points at the time, it was a bitter pill. Luther Burrell’s pass was heading to the replacement Harry Mallinder who had George North – back from his latest break following a head injury, outside him – but a try was not a certainty as Halaifonua attempted to intercept. Northampton’s director of rugby, Jim Mallinder, felt that the referee, Matt Carley, made the right decision: “We were going to score that. It was a clear overlap so it was the only decision the referee could make.” His opposite number, David Humphreys, however, felt Ben Morgan’s disallowed try, when Gloucester were 9-3 ahead, was more costly. “We’re devastated. It’s frustration, disappointment. We felt like we’ve been on the wrong end of decisions these last couple of weeks. Rather than focusing on the penalty try, Ben Morgan believes he was over the line but unfortunately there were not enough camera-angles to prove it.” Until that point, it had been a match typical of both sides’ seasons. Northampton were at least spirited in defence – Courtney Lawes excelled at second-row – but they were helped by Gloucester’s inability to take advantage of their territory and possession. It was, truth be told, a poor match, not helped by the dreadful conditions which considering the plight of these two sides in recent years, rather aptly left them stuck in the mud. Northampton, though, are up to sixth after back-to-back wins, can enjoy some good fortune after their latest travails with Dylan Hartley and the situation over their handling of North’s head injury, and may move up to fifth if they beat Bristol on Saturday. “I’m very pleased, I think it was a little bit of a dogfight,” added Mallinder. “We want to come down here and scrap for a win so it’s a very positive start, a very happy new year.” North was conspicuous in the first half, only in so far as his white jersey was pristine throughout whereas his team-mates were covered in mud. It was not a day suited to wings but for club and country North is far too often on the periphery. His first touch came after 13 minutes, successfully claiming a high ball, but it was not until the stroke of half-time that he received a pass. Whether it is an inability to get him the ball, or an effect of his series of head injuries, it is a terrible shame. It was during this fixture a little more than three years ago when North produced a devastating burst of power and speed to leave defenders strewn all over the field and set up the Premiership’s try of the season, but he looks a shadow of that player at present, even if the coach was pleased with his contribution. “[He is] really pleased to be back playing. He’s been training well and it’s good to see him out there,” Mallinder said. “Not [a day for wings] in terms of ball in hand and superb attacking rugby. But an important part to play and I thought he was safe in front of the high ball.” Some of the handling on show was dreadful and not all of it can be blamed on the slippery ball, but Matt Kvesic shone for Gloucester in the first half and one thundering tackle on Kieran Brookes just before the half hour stopped Saints a metre short of the line. By that stage Gloucester had converted territorial dominance into only three points with a Billy Burns penalty from the left, but the fly-half added two more before the interval. Eight minutes into the second half Northampton were off the mark with a penalty for Myler in front of the posts. Gloucester responded and after their forwards had laid siege to the Northampton line the home side thought they had scored through Morgan in the left-hand corner only for replays to prove inconclusive. Myler then exchanged penalties with Burns but more handling errors let Gloucester down as they sought the try to put the match to bed. They could not find it and after a brief period of pressure from Northampton, Halaifonua digressed, and the match was snatched from Gloucester’s grasp.

ITV Racing’s impressive roster of talent did not combine to make the powerful, confident first broadcast for which producers must have hoped as the channel ended its 30-year absence from the track but there were enough promising signs to suggest that future efforts will leave this first spin far&nbsp;behind. It was a brave decision to ditch the on-course studio employed by Channel&nbsp;4 and put the main presenters in the middle of the paddock and on balance it still feels like the right call, drawing the viewer right into the atmosphere of the day’s racing. Unfortunately, the atmosphere on New Year’s Day at Cheltenham was sopping wet. “We want to go where the people at the track go,” was the advance word from the editorial team, thinking of the paddock and the betting ring, but that laudable ambition was foiled as almost the entire crowd sought shelter in the racecourse’s sundry bars and bistros. Overhead shots showed that, most unusually, the steps around the famous Cheltenham winner’s enclosure were deserted while ITV’s plucky front men stood alone, huddled under umbrellas. “At least we’ve got a nice day for it,” was the game beginning from Ed Chamberlin, poached from Sky Sports to be ITV’s face of horse racing. He claimed to be with those noted former jockeys Sir Anthony McCoy and Luke Harvey, but that had to be taken on trust at first, their faces obscured by raindrops on camera lenses. “It’s wet, it’s miserable but it’s going to be terrific,” we were assured, a promise backed up by a montage of clips from ITV’s rich racing heritage, making early reference to Nijinsky and Lester Piggott, John Oaksey, Dickie Davies, Arkle and sun-soaked shots of Tattenham Corner. Then, deflatingly, came the first live action, a four-runner novice chase in which the expert commentary of Richard Hoiles was quite hard to hear for the first mile, because of the volume at which hoofbeats from the track were also played. The graphics, which seemed to use up only a portion of the available screen, proved hard to read and not just for this writer, judging by Twitter complaints. And just at the point when viewers may have begun to harbour doubts, Matt Chapman dropped a clanger during his betting ring beat by playing an impromptu game of “hair or no hair” with a bookmaker. Quite why anyone should be interested in what a middle‑aged man keeps under his bobble hat is hard to fathom. Chapman has waited an age for his debut on one of the main channels precisely because he has sometimes extemporised as oddly as this on At The Races, but he is self-aware and ditched some of the wackier stuff in recent years. Surely only an excessive desire to entertain can account for him going immediately off-piste on his ITV debut. He will not have impressed many of those unfamiliar with his work but he will get lots more chances. Hardly any racing broadcasters have his capacity to inform, provoke and engage, and perhaps he will give us a smoother run, now that the air is out of his tyres. As the programme progressed, Chapman fared better despite suffering as badly as John McCririck ever did from the sort of fools who want to shove themselves into an on-air shot. Chapman may eventually need a couple of heavies to keep such folk at bay. The best of this first ITV show was an affectionate portrait of the trainer Jonjo O’Neill, making splendid use of archive film of his glory days in the saddle during the 70s. “You’ve been in racing for 50 years,” the interviewer said. “Sure, I’m only a baby,” O’Neill replied with a smile. On this evidence, features are going to be a very strong point for ITV. Pre-race analysis needs some work but we can doubtless expect better when the quality of racing is stronger than it was here. The show gathered strength. Harvey did well to spot Daryl Jacob’s foot slipping out of his stirrup as the jockey fought a close finish and lost. A camera in the weighing room caught Sam Twiston-Davies’s reaction as he watched his younger brother, Willy, riding his first Cheltenham winner. McCoy had the best line, telling Chamberlin: “In sport, anything’s possible. Who’d have thought of Leicester ruling the Premier League? Or that you’d go from a nice, warm studio working with great pundits in Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher to standing out in the rain at Cheltenham with Luke Harvey and me?” Indeed, there may be some mileage in giving McCoy the role of comedy curmudgeon, a series of surprise winners leading him to grouse that only the weather forecaster had got anything right. There certainly seems to be some creative tension between him and Chapman. “We have survived, just,” Chamberlin concluded. The social media response to his show was by then so varied that one news outlet called it “the most divisive thing since Brexit”. Now that everyone involved has been blooded, it may be a relief to move to the calmer backwaters of ITV4 for two months of low-key jump racing. By the time of the Cheltenham Festival in mid-March, we can all hope to see a more polished performance.','https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/01/itv-racing-stumble-cheltenham-debut-ed-chamberlin-tony-mccoy-horse-racing','ITV Racing team falter at first fence on their Cheltenham debut',36),('sport/2017/jan/01/leicester-saracens-premiership-match-report','Manu Tuilagi could not have worse luck if he throttled several black cats. Eight minutes into the sixth match of his latest comeback, he made a typical outside break that it took three tacklers to thwart but lay on the ground clutching his right knee and had to be helped off, little more than 24 hours after the Lions centre had been named in the England squad. His impact in possession was missed by the Tigers, who lacked a focal point in the tightest of matches and slumped to their second home defeat of the campaign. Instead of going to Brighton for a two-day training camp on Sunday night, Tuilagi had another visit to hospital to look forward to and a scan. “At least his groin is fine,” said the Leicester director of rugby, Richard Cockerill, referring to the problem that had played a large part in restricting the midfielder to 38 appearances in four seasons. “He got a bang on the outside of his knee and these things need up to 48 hours. I saw him at half-time: he smiled and I laughed. We crack on, don’t we?” Crack was the word for Leicester, who tried going toe-to-toe with the most obdurate of opponents but tripped themselves up. In a match played in drizzle after a morning of heavy rain, the ball spent much of the time in the air, Ben Spencer, the day after he made England’s elite squad, getting the better of Ben Youngs, not least because of the protection he was given at the breakdown. Spencer had the time to hang his kicks and give his chasers every opportunity of either catching the ball or hitting the defender who had taken possession. Meanwhile Youngs was rushed into decisions by Maro Itoje, who capped another eye-catching performance by making an unusual charge-down, sliding in football style after Owen Williams had kicked with his left foot and getting the ball rather than his opponent’s ankle. Leicester achieved a surprising measure of dominance up front, Ellis Genge, looking to give the watching Eddie Jones a nudge after the head coach left him out of the national squad, and Dan Cole winning a succession of penalties in the scrum. But so convincingly had Saracens won the kicking game that only two were within the kicking range of Owen Williams. It was from a kick that Saracens scored the only try of the game after 54 minutes, seconds after Williams had hooked a 35-metre penalty that would have put the Tigers 12-6 ahead. As Leicester looked to play the ball on their own 10-metre line, Rhodes again showed his nuisance value and Youngs had not got the ball firmly in his grasp when he looped a pass to&nbsp;Williams. As the fly-half tried to take the ball above his head he was unnerved by the looming presence of Brad Barritt, who seized possession and set up a ruck. Saracens went left, where Owen Farrell used the threat of the 22st Will Skelton outside him to commit Mike Williams to cover the second row. That created a hole which Cole, standing inside Farrell, was never going to fill and the outside-half ran in from 30 metres for the score that came to be decisive. When Leicester’s moment came 13 minutes from time, they lacked the same calculation. Barritt’s chip just inside Leicester’s half was blocked by Jack Roberts and Tuilagi’s replacement Tom Brady carried the ball into Saracens’ 22 where, tackled by Alex Goode, he passed to Roberts outside him. The timing was wrong and Barritt tracked back to make up for his mistake. The two incidents marked a crucial difference between the sides and, while it was Saracens’ first league win here since 2013, Leicester have won only four of the last 17 Premiership meetings with the champions. Sarries closed the gap with the leaders, Wasps, to one point with a victory that was achieved without the Vunipola brothers and the England second-row George Kruis, who is unlikely to play again this month after suffering a broken cheekbone but is expected to be fit for the start of the Six Nations. Sarries’ kicking game helped compensate for the drop in rushing metres in the absence of the Vunipolas on a day when territory was king. Leicester took the lead on 10 minutes with the first of Williams’ four penalties but he missed two others, including one from just wide of the posts at the end of the first half when Leicester had for the only time in the match made their scrum dominance count near their opponents’ line. Cockerill reached for the word hindsight when asked if another scrum and with it the prospect of a penalty try would have been the better option, but Saracens, who lost Chris Ashton to a head injury in the second half, would still have found a way to win. The Tigers have been able for the most part to mask their shortcomings at home this season after being exposed away which is why the latest loss of Tuilagi is so cruel. He was in full flow, leaving Farrell grasping air and Marcelo Bosch hanging on grimly when Sean Maitland clattered the centre from behind and caught his right knee. Accidents happen to Tuilagi more often than most and England again look like having to prepare for a tournament without him.

The pair looked beaten as the 2-1 favourite, L’Ami Serge, went clear on the run-in but Kelly regathered her mount and drove him back in front as the line came. Kelly and her stepfather, Nick Williams, who trained both her winners, have had a troubled start to this jumps season. From April to December, she managed only three victories, while Williams’s stable had just a couple more. Their period in the doldrums was the more surprising for following so soon after a Grade One success with Tea For Two last season and Agrapart’s win in the Betfair, Europe’s most valuable handicap hurdle. The 23-year-old Kelly said after Agrapart’s return to the winner’s enclosure in this Grade Two: “This horse is a legend. I knew he had a great shout. We came in quietly at 16-1 but the way he won the Betfair, I knew he’d stay further and it’s rained all day, which was always going to suit him. “It’s been a real hard season up to now. I know I’m trying my best out there and it is difficult, watching race after race with no real results. Fingers crossed this continues now. “I had a double at Towcester on Boxing Day a few seasons ago and in point-to-points back in the day, but this is easily my most significant double.” Kelly is the only woman to have ridden a Grade One winner in British jump racing. While professional female jump jockeys remain in short supply, five of them enjoyed wins around the country yesterday, the others being Lucy Alexander, Lucy Gardner, Megan Carberry and Bridget Andrews. Williams said Agrapart would now be aimed at the Stayers’ Hurdle over an extra half-mile, since the horse might lack the pace for races over the Relkeel distance once the ground dries up in March. But the Stayers’ has a strong favourite in Unowhatimeanharry and bookmakers were sufficiently relaxed about the threat posed by Agrapart to leave him on 33-1. Coo Star Sivola, who also scored for Kelly and Williams, is probably not good enough for a place in the Festival’s Neptune Novice Hurdle. The trainer suggested he might line up instead in the Martin Pipe Handicap, a race for conditional jockeys in which Kelly is able to take part. Nicky Henderson was foiled by the defeat of L’Ami Serge, whose jockey, Daryl Jacob, had a mud-slathered boot slip out of its stirrup in the closing stages. But the Lambourn trainer won the other Grade Two on the card when Whisper held off the odds-on favourite, Clan Des Obeaux, by half a length. Twice a Grade One winner over hurdles in years gone by, Whisper was in lifeless form last season but is unbeaten in two runs this winter, both over fences at Cheltenham. On this occasion, he benefited from a badly timed mistake by his main rival at the second-last. “He’s just tough and genuine and is a real friend,” said Henderson, who suggested the nine-year-old’s Festival target would be the JLT, while adding the caveat that Whisper may yet step up to three miles for the RSA. “The key question now is whether he has a run before the Festival. He doesn’t need to have one.” Willy Twiston-Davies rode his first winner at Cheltenham aboard Cogry, five years after being unseated from Baby Run with the Foxhunter Chase at his mercy. The jockey has been riding on the Flat for most of the intervening period but has recently taken a break from that and suggested here that the endless round of all-weather racing had ceased to grip him. The jockey’s father, Nigel, who trains Cogry, was delighted for his son and also for the horse, who was seeking a boost to his confidence after two falls, an unseat and a brought-down, from four starts over fences this season. “That’s what they both needed,” said Twiston-Davies Sr. “The horse had a miserable time and none of those things had been his fault. Ever since his last fall we thought we would give up over fences for one or two races. His jumping was just impeccable. It was so great that William could ride him.”','https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/01/lizzie-kelly-big-double-cheltenham-agrapart-women-riders-horse-racing','Lizzie Kelly back in the headlines with big double at Cheltenham',27),('sport/2017/jan/02/short-memories-as-australian-selectors-return-to-all-rounder-obsession','Australia’s squad for the summer-ending Sydney is often anomalous. A turning wicket, a dead series or even a new year can lend an incongruity to the summer preceding it. Mitch Marsh and Peter Nevill batted at three and four respectively at the SCG last year. It’s where Colin Miller once opened the bowling and Stuart MacGill would always get a game. Of all home Tests, this is the one where the course, broadly speaking, truly appears to dictate the horse. In that sense it’s a convenient setting for selectors to mask the abandonment of its short-lived “six specialist batsmen” policy, instead racing back into the arms of the all-rounder who can “do a bit of both”. Their fondness for the player who serves as insurance against fast bowling fatigue and injury is well understood, even if said player’s actual effectiveness isn’t. Australia’s recent series losses to England, Sri Lanka and South Africa were largely built on paltry batting returns; securing twenty wickets was rarely an issue. Hilton Cartwright might promise the fast bowling cadre an extra breather, but at what cost to Australian runs? Glibly speaking, cricket teams have 11 players and the sixth spot is its mathematical middle. As such, the style of player selected there reveals much about the team’s approach. Amid the extensive praise for Asad Shafiq’s superb innings in Brisbane laid an uncomfortable question for Australia: when was the last time a number six influenced a match so heavily for the men in green and gold? Beneath it sits a deeper question at the heart of Australia’s approach to its number six role: what does the team need more help with? Batting or bowling? Australian cricket – so often purveyor of confidence and simplicity – is unaccustomed to tying itself in philosophical knots, though something shifted about ten years ago. After a reasonably stable commitment to six batsmen, four bowlers and a keeper, selectors uncharacteristically uprooted policy. Maybe it was Adam Gilchrist’s retirement, maybe it was Andrew Flintoff’s destruction, maybe they were scared of life post-Warne (some of us still are), but from late 2005, selectorial orthodoxy was abandoned in a desperate search for an Australian all-rounder to call its own; someone to win matches with profound contributions in both disciplines, who could compound that value by shouldering a load that would leave their specialists fresh. In other words, someone approaching the perfect cricketer. Throughout history, there hasn’t been many. Of course, Australia never found its Freddie. It found Shane Watson, though to most he never seemed enough. As the search continues, history will be increasingly kind to him. The futility of Australia’s search revealed more about the rare brilliance of Flintoff than anything else. Unable to find an antipodean equivalent Australia lowered its bar a little. Instead of an intense, passionate, match-winning heartthrob with bat and ball, it’s since sought players who can “help out a bit” in both parts of the game; the real “chip in” Test cricketer. After Watson, Mitchell Marsh was bequeathed the role. He proved able-enough foil with the ball, providing those so-treasured 10 to 15 overs to relieve the bowling cartel. But he didn’t score enough runs and people started to pine again for a Real Australian Number Six. And besides, what good was a potent attack if it had no runs to bowl to? Marsh, as bowling all-rounders are wont to do, bolstered the bowling but robbed the batting. The role has always had the feel of robbing Peter to pay Paul. So selectors reverted to the pre-2005 convention. Six batsmen, four bowlers and a keeper. Callum Ferguson and Nic Maddinson – earmarked prodigies from successive generations – were brought in to once again uphold the lofty traditions of the position once held by proper run scorers: Walters, Waugh, Ponting and Martyn, to name a few. Both selections polarised opinion, but there was a deeper point beneath. Australia had shifted strategy. Once again, they would select the best players in each of cricket’s primary disciplines. The role-player was vanquished. But the break-up always felt temporary. Unhelped by Maddinson’s quadruple failures, Australian bowling coach David Saker’s recent comments suggested the all-rounder – once it got its act together – would always be welcomed back in the house. Put forward by Cricket Australia to speak at a Test match press conference on behalf of the Australian Cricket team, in Australian cricket uniform, as one of its senior coaches, he claimed to be an outsider without influence as he unequivocally plumped for another bowler to help the quicks. “We are desperately looking for that all-rounder who can bowl some overs for us,” Saker said. The comments arrived after Pakistan had posted 450 in Brisbane followed by 443 on a comatose MCG wicket. Naturally, if you’re overworked and unsupported you appeal for help. Nurses, teachers and anyone who’s ever had a tough job will empathise. It’s uncertain whom Saker was referring to by “we”. Further, how Nic Maddinson was to interpret those comments ahead of his final, and failing, shot says much about how temporary he really was, and how wedded Australia is to the all-rounder number six. So Australia returns to the role player. It’s a curious phenomenon in long form cricket. For a game requiring such exclusive expertise in two separate disciplines – where being proficient at even one is hard enough – how teams can contrive to find a place for someone not singularly expert in either appears counterintuitive. And whereas Australia’s batting group waited years for a policy shift, two long innings’ was all it took for a reversal. This turnaround reveals much: how important Australia’s fast bowlers are to winning, how little it trusts its spinners, and how reliant it is on the triumvirate of Smith, Warner and Khawaja to post competitive totals.','https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/02/short-memories-as-australian-selectors-return-to-all-rounder-obsession','Short memories as Australian selectors return to all-rounder obsession | Sam Perry',28),('sustainable-business/2017/jan/01/sustainable-technology-2016-climate-change-environment','It’s been a rollercoaster of a year. In the world of sustainability alone, we saw the landmark Paris climate change agreement come into force; learned how rising temperatures in the Arctic are negatively impacting local residents; and watched as the world’s top conservationists mourned the declining state of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. And then, a bombshell: a certain “short-fingered vulgarian” won the US presidential race and called into question everything from America’s basic environmental protection to Nasa’s ongoing climate change research. Corporate America took evasive action, signing a letter telling Donald Trump it is serious about sustainability, while others began unpacking Trump’s emphasis on “clean coal” and what it really means for the future of energy in the US. But it hasn’t all been doom and gloom. While the rest of the world struggled to come to terms with the aforementioned craziness, innovators, scientists and tech heads worked quietly from the sidelines to come up with solutions. And some succeeded: from a trashcan that sucks up ocean garbage to a drone that delivers vaccines to endangered ferrets, here are our top picks for this year’s best sustainable tech. A trashcan for the ocean It’s no secret that our oceans are turning into swirling garbage dumps. There are some 5.25tn pieces of floating plastic debris in the oceans right now, and it’s estimated that some 8m metric tons of plastic waste enter global waters every year. Earlier this year, Peter Ceglinski and Andrew Turton, two surfers from Australia, came up with a device they’re calling the Seabin – a kind of submersible garbage can that captures floating trash. Picture a cylinder, with the upper opening just below the surface of the water. An electric pump draws water through the bottom of the cylinder, creating a vortex around the upper edge that pulls in water and floating trash. A bag filter, made of natural material, collects the trash and allows water to pass through. After raising more than $267,000 in an Indiegogo campaign to help build the device, Ceglinski and Turton are keen to start selling the Seabin to marinas around the world. First stop: Miami, Florida, where Miami Beach’s marinas manager wants to start using the Seabin in 2017 to counter the bags, bottles, paper plates and forks found daily in the water. A handheld cancer-detecting device Earlier this year, British-based tech firm QuantuMDx developed a new, low-cost diagnostic DNA analyzer the size of a smartphone which is being billed as a “handheld lab”. The device – called Q-Poc – can accurately diagnose everything from cancers to infectious diseases in minutes. Although it is currently in alpha testing stage, the company hopes to get the product in the hands of doctors by early 2018. Q-Poc runs on a solar-powered battery and it’s designed to read biological samples submitted via a credit card-size cartridge. It can work with a range of sample types: swabs can be used to detect sexually-transmitted infections, while saliva is used to detect tuberculosis. (Tests for other diseases will be added at a later date.) The device uses mobile technology, enabling the test results to be geo-stamped and shared in real time. The prospect of a speedy diagnosis at a patient’s side is exciting, particularly in countries where access to medical care is a challenge. Subject to regulatory approval by the World Health Organization (WHO), QuantuMDx hopes to initially roll out the Q-Poc unit in South Africa, before expanding to other markets. Stuff you can eat (instead of throwing it away) It was a big year for edible everyday items, like cutlery and beer cans. First up, an Indian cutlery company, Bakeys, invented cutlery that you can eat as a way to tackle plastic waste in oceans and landfill. (Welcome to a new geological epoch of trash – scientists are calling it the manmade Anthropocene.) Plastic cutlery significantly contributes to this problem – estimates suggest the US alone uses 40bn plastic utensils a year. Hence the need for edible versions. Bakeys makes vegan-friendly cutlery from rice, wheat and an ancient grain called sorghum, which was picked because it doesn’t go soggy when immersed in liquid. The cutlery comes in three flavors: savory (salt and cumin); sweet (sugar); and plain. And, if you’re wondering – it kind of tastes like a dry cracker. Why not wash down the cutlery with an edible beer holder? Americans are consuming more beer it seems – 67bn beer cans each year, apparently. According to the Brewers Association, this number is expected to grow significantly as craft breweries get more popular. The problem is that plastic beer can holders pose a threat to fish and marine wildlife when they end up in the ocean. Saltwater Brewery, based in Florida, has come up with a solution: biodegradable, edible beer pack rings made from wheat and barley waste. The rings disintegrate within two hours of being in the ocean, which prevents fish or other sea animals getting stuck. They’re also harmless if ingested by curious fish. More than 50 craft breweries have already contacted Saltwater expressing an interest in using the edible rings. The brewery is now developing metal molds capable of making 400,000 rings per month and hopes to build a centralized production facility by 2017. A drone that helps endangered species One of 2016’s most heartwarming stories revolved around a cunning plan by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) to bombard a ferret habitat in Montana with a vaccine administered via specially designed drones that can “shoot” pellets in three directions at the same time. All this in a bid to save the endangered black-footed ferret. The vaccine pellets are actually intended for the prairie dog population inside the habitat at the UL Bend National Wildlife Refuge. The ferrets are dependent upon prairie dogs for food and shelter, but a flea-borne disease called sylvatic plague has slowly been killing the prairie dogs off. The FWS came up with a “glorified gumball machine” to spit out the vaccine pellets. The machine which can be attached to a drone which uses GPS to drop the pellets throughout the habitat. Oh, and if you’re wondering: the FWS said lab tests show that prairie dogs find the bait in the vaccines “delicious”. Using 3D printers to eliminate plastic waste As we’ve established, humans produce a lot of trash – apparently of the more than 300m tons of plastic produced globally every year, one refuse truck’s worth ends up in our waters, landfills and streets every minute. One of our favorite stories this year came from India, where a local entrepreneur has set up a production facility at a local rubbish dump, where waste pickers convert high-density polyethylene (HPDE) – mostly used for plastic bottles – into 3D printing filament to eventually be sold to 3D printing companies. The market for 3D printing filament – the majority of which is made from virgin plastic – is growing rapidly. A recent report predicted the 3D printing materials market will grow by nearly 266% in the next five years. And, while the market for ethical filament is still relatively small, the greatest potential 3D printing seems to be offering the developing world is employment – there are an estimated 15 million people globally who currently make their living from waste picking, for example.','https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jan/01/sustainable-technology-2016-climate-change-environment','The five innovations that shaped sustainability in 2016',3),('tv-and-radio/2017/jan/01/sherlock-benedict-cumberbatch-review-james-bond-margaret-thatcher-mark-gatiss-steven-moffat-detective','Spoiler alert: this review contains spoilers to the Sherlock episode The Six Thatchers, which aired on 1 January 2017. It may have been discussed in advance for featuring the destruction of one strong Englishwoman – the plot involves the smashing of six statues of Margaret Thatcher – but the New Year’s Day episode of Sherlock will make headlines after transmission for the annihilation of another. Mary Watson, the wife of Holmes’s sidekick, shockingly became – following Matthew Crawley in Downton Abbey and Nigel Pargetter in The Archers – the latest fictional character sacrificed over the festive period. Sherlock co-creators Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss also work on Doctor Who, which was awarded the other prime seasonal slot on the BBC on Christmas Day. But although the franchises have to some extent overlapped, both tending towards tragicomic love stories, viewers knew that as Amanda Abbington lay slain on the floor she would not shimmeringly regenerate into another actor. The Arthur Conan Doyle story on which Gatiss based his script has busts of Napoleon being smashed by an intruder. Here, the French emperor’s replacement with the former British prime minister has led to some muttering about the BBC’s supposed leftwing bias. But the point, as Sherlock immediately realises, is that the vandal has no political motivation: he’s looking for something hidden inside a head. In one respect, Gatiss has even depoliticised the original, which is filled with references to immigrants and refugees, “the outcasts of Europe”. A new sub-plot involving the historical decisions of a villainous woman in Whitehall also logically seemed to lead to Thatcher, but the script again opted to give the BBC press office a quiet holiday. The bulk of the rewrite, though, stayed scrupulously close to the source. In The Adventure of the Six Napoleons, Watson notes Holmes “being more nearly moved by the softer human emotions than I had ever seen him”. And Benedict Cumberbatch, in The Six Thatchers, is duly allowed far beyond his usual constricted emotional range. In the middle of the last decade, two veteran fantasy brands – Doctor Who and James Bond – simultaneously hit on the idea of casting classical actors (Christopher Eccleston and Daniel Craig) who could play a Time Lord or a spy with the intensity of Hamlet. Continuing the trend, Cumberbatch stalks Baker Street like a Danish prince with a decisive streak. But this time, as if blurring with Craig, he became a sort of 00221B. The episode felt very Bond overall – Holmes has never done so much running towards or away from explosions. And thanks to the dramatic impact achieved by director Rachel Talalay, the murder of Mary matched the death of M in Skyfall. Confronted with a dead friend, her widower and their motherless baby, Cumberbatch’s face (mainly required to remain blank) painted a picture of pain and confusion. And with Mary taking a bullet meant for Sherlock, Martin Freeman’s Watson let out an extended, escalating, animalistic moan. It’s unclear how Gatiss specified the sound in the script but, for King Lear, it was written as the hardest line in theatre: “Howl, howl, howl, howl!” During a Q&amp;A session after a premiere screening on 19 December, Freeman and Abbington discussed the weirdness of a real-life couple acting the tragic end of a relationship. But soon afterwards, it emerged that the context was uncanny: the actors had actually separated shortly before filming. Moffat and Gatiss told the same press conference that they were unsure if the remaining cast could be united for future series. Ominously, the last episode in this run, which airs on 15 January, is called The Final Problem – the name of the Conan Doyle story in which Holmes dies. Sherlock detectives will deduce a possible significance from this being the only one of the 13 episodes to use an original title without any alteration. But even if the worst were to happen, fans of this super-intelligent and hyper-entertaining show – which reached new heights of action and emotion in The Six Thatchers – will note that Conan Doyle, after his Final Problem, had to bring the character back by popular demand.','https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/01/sherlock-benedict-cumberbatch-review-james-bond-margaret-thatcher-mark-gatiss-steven-moffat-detective','Sherlock review – Cumberbatch channels Bond in the most explosive outing yet',12),('uk-news/2017/jan/01/fireworks-launch-hull-uk-city-of-culture','Thousands of people gathered to watch fireworks and a spectacular opening installation to launch Hull’s year as the UK’s City of Culture on Sunday. Sean McAllister, a documentary filmmaker from Hull, said the Made In Hull event – a city-wide artistic installation around major landmarks – would show people that the city had hidden culture. A huge audience packed in to Queen Victoria Square to watch as stories of the city and its people over the last 70 years were projected on to nearby buildings. McAllister said: “We’re finally going to share our secret. If you’re from Hull, we always knew we had culture, it’s just the world didn’t know, so the secret’s out. Finally we’ve had to let them in. In a way we’ve kind of had these doors up to keep everybody out of our culture. “It’s just for us, we’ve had it as a subculture but, damn it, we’ve finally had to open the door to the international world and let them in. They can come and see what we’ve been enjoying.” From the devastating bombing during the second world war, to the disappearance of its fishing fleet in the 1970s due to the cod wars, to the decimation of its shipping industry, Hull has struggled during the last seven decades. Hull city council leader Stephen Brady called it “a city that had lost its confidence”. But he believes Hull’s tenure as UK City of Culture 2017 will breathe new life into the city. Hull is the second city to be given this honour, following Derry-Londonderry four years ago. It was selected in 2013 from a shortlist which included Dundee, Leicester and Swansea Bay. More than £30m is being spent on the year’s events and £25m has been invested in revamping the city centre and refurbishing the Ferens Art Gallery and the city’s main theatre. This, Brady says, is an attempt for the city to entice new businesses and employers who will bring their staff with them and create more jobs. The city recently secured a £310m commitment by the German-owned firm Siemens to build new offshore wind turbines in the city, creating up to 1,000 jobs. “We did it with Siemens and we can do it again. We want people to stay here, we want there to be opportunities. This year is so important in so many ways, we need it to breathe life into Hull and keep it buoyant for future generations,” he said. Brady, a former butcher’s boy who grew up in a three-bedroomed terraced house with his eleven siblings, says it was about time to change the conversation about his home city. He said: “Hull is a city like no other, it is more like a large village. “There is also the fact that it is the end of the line in terms of road and rail networks. There is essentially nowhere beyond, which gives it a very isolated feel. We needed something to keep people here, bring in new talent, jobs, employers. Getting this City of Culture status has been as sweet as a nut.” Celebrations began in earnest on Sunday night with the official opening spectacular. Thousands of people lined the waterfront for a fireworks display to mark the beginning of Made In Hull, as its historic buildings become backdrops for projections illustrating and celebrating more than 70 years of the city’s history. The crowd in the city centre square – where one of eight art installations will be located for the next week – chanted a countdown before a projection of a propeller was beamed on to the Ferens Art Gallery building. The crowd then fell silent as they watched Hull’s history, from pilot Amy Johnson’s solo flight to Australia in 1930 to the present day, projected around the square. Other installations in the Made In Hull event include Hullywood Icons, featuring local people recreating images from classic films, and a multi-screen and sound installation recreating the club scene in 90s Yorkshire. Sunday may be the official opening but the buzz began over the summer, when US artist Spencer Tunick convinced 3,200 locals to strip naked and have themselves painted blue for his trademark photographs around Hull’s landmarks celebrating the city’s relationship with the sea. Other events planned over the year include a visit by the Turner prize, plus a one-off gig from David Bowie’s old backing band, the Spiders from Mars. Brady, 70, who has been council leader since 2011, admits that some may have trouble coming to grips with some of the “wackier” installations, but he will be gritting his teeth and trying new things. Hull has ambitions to become the next Liverpool, which reinvented itself following its year as European Capital of Culture in 2008. The status earned the city bumper visitor numbers and a multimillion-pound boost to its economy. The festival year saw 9.7m visitors to the city, an increase of 34%, and generated £753.8m for the economy. Brady said: “The perception of Liverpool was forever changed after its city of culture year and that’s what we are hoping for here. We don’t want to return to our sleepy old times again – we want others to say it is a wonderful place that they will return to again and again.” So far, there have been upgrades to streets and public buildings in Hull city centre. The improvements include the makeover of Humber Street in the old Fruit Market, where galleries and other artistic businesses are based. A £700,000, 350-seat outdoor theatre will also be built in the city’s disused Central Dry Dock. One of its most famous sons, the poet Philip Larkin, once said it is “a city that is in the world, yet sufficiently on the edge of it to have a different resonance”. Brady said: “We are not a people that shout loudly or sing our own praises like others. We quietly go about our own way. But now those barriers are coming down and we will not disappoint.” Forthcoming events With a budget of £32m, there is expected to be a blizzard of arts and culture in the city over 365 days. These are some of the events taking place in the first three months.

Much of the UK saw New Year’s Day downpours, but the rain will give way to a frosty start to the year as temperatures fall below zero as far south as the Chiltern Hills, where sleet and snow are possible. Temperatures are set to drop to their lowest point so far this winter, with forecasters predicting a possible -7C (19.4F) in Wales and the Scottish Highlands. Sophie Yeomans, a meteorologist at the Met Office, said: “We’ve got a cold front across the south of the country. The rain should clear, but moving in behind that we have a lot of cold air coming from the north. It’s going to be very frosty at night and temperatures will drop below zero.” A level two warning has been issued, which lasts until 3pm on Tuesday. Yeomans said: “Cold weather alerts are given to let people know it’s going to be quite cold and they should put the heating on. “There is also a yellow warning for across the north, Scotland and parts of Northern Ireland, which is to warn people about ice that could cause hazardous conditions on the roads.” The lowest temperature for the UK at this time of year was -18.5C, recorded in Braemar, Aberdeenshire, in 1962. The weather is set to warm up slightly later in the week, but Yeomans said temperatures were only likely to rise by a couple of degrees. Public Health England also issued warnings about the upcoming cold spell. People were advised to turn their heating on, keep an eye on elderly neighbours and stay tuned to weather forecasts. Dr Thomas Waite of PHE’s extreme events team said: “Every winter thousands of people die because of their exposure to cold weather, and doctors’ surgeries, hospitals and other parts of the NHS are kept busy as people fall ill. “That’s why it’s really important that we all do everything we can to ensure everyone stays well this winter. The elderly, very young and those with pre-existing health conditions are most at risk during cold weather. “Keeping homes heated to at least 18C is a great way to avoid the health problems from cold, as is stocking up on food and medicine before cold weather sets in and wearing lots of thin layers, instead of fewer thick ones.”','https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/01/icy-weather-to-follow-new-year-downpours','Icy weather to follow new year downpours',33),('us-news/2017/jan/01/barack-obama-donald-trump-twitter','Barack Obama on Sunday used Twitter, a medium notoriously favoured by the man who will succeed him in the White House, to tout his achievements in office. “As we look ahead to the future,” Obama wrote in his first tweet, “I wanted to take a moment to look back on the remarkable progress that you made possible these past [eight] years.” From 20 January and for the next four years, barring unforeseen circumstances, Obama’s place in the Oval Office will be taken by the businessman Donald Trump. On Sunday Trump’s incoming White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, told ABC’s This Week the president-elect would continue to use Twitter to announce policy and make comment on current events. The medium, he said, was a way to avoid mainstream media outlets and get his message directly to the American public. Despite widespread concern over the flagrant provocation and outright disregard for protocol displayed by many of Trump’s tweets, Spicer said: “You know what? The fact of the matter is that when he tweets, he gets results.” In an interview with CBS 60 Minutes after his election victory over Hillary Clinton, Trump said that he would now be “very restrained, if I use it at all” regarding social media. He has not achieved that aim. On 28 December, to take one among many examples, he used Twitter to say: “Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks. Thought it was going to be a smooth transition – NOT!” On Sunday, the subject of that tweet sent out sober comments about a number of results he has achieved. “Facing the worst financial crisis in 80 years,” he wrote, “you delivered the longest streak of job growth in our history. “After decades of rising healthcare costs, today nearly every American now has access to the financial security of affordable healthcare.” The latter tweet spoke to a key concern among Democrats, as Trump and Republicans in Congress consider ways to repeal the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. Obama is reportedly arranging a meeting with congressional Democrats to consider ways to preserve his signature legislative achievement. The president’s next tweet hinted at progressive fears over Trump’s nomination of a number of climate change deniers to key positions in his cabinet. Obama continued: “We traded foreign oil for clean energy, we doubled fuel efficiency standards [and] we acted on a global scale to save the one planet we’ve got.” He added: “We brought home more of our troops [and] strengthened US leadership– leading with diplomacy [and] partnering with nations to meet global problems.” Obama also said: “From realizing marriage equality to removing barriers to opportunity, we’ve made history in our work to reaffirm that all are created equal.” In conclusion, the president tweeted: “It’s been the privilege of my life to serve as your president. I look forward to standing with you as a citizen. Happy New Year everybody.” Obama’s @POTUS Twitter account has 12.9 million followers, compared with 18.3 million for @RealDonaldTrump. As of 5pm ET on New Year’s Day, the president-elect had not tweeted anything since a series of celebratory tweets and retweets sent shortly before the turn of the year. Not long before that, he tweeted a supposedly conciliatory message: “Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don’t know what to do. Love!”','https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/01/barack-obama-donald-trump-twitter','Obama treads on Trump\'s Twitter turf to reflect on presidential achievements',15),('us-news/2017/jan/01/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-russia-hacking-sean-spicer','As Russian diplomats expelled by Barack Obama left the US on Sunday, Donald Trump’s incoming White House spokesman attempted to cast as a diplomatic triumph the president-elect’s controversial response to intelligence community reports that Moscow sought to influence the presidential election. “That’s actually good for our country,” Sean Spicer told ABC’s This Week, referring to Russian president Vladimir Putin’s decision not to pursue immediate retaliation. “So everyone wants to talk about the tweets that he sends, but I want to focus on the action that he’s getting. Donald Trump’s not president yet and he’s getting action, successes and wins both abroad and here at home.” Trump’s decision to praise Putin, question intelligence findings and repeatedly say the US should “move on” places the president-elect at odds not just with the current White House, but with his own party in Congress. On Thursday, Obama ordered the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomatic personnel and the closure of estates in Maryland and New York used by embassy staff. The expelled personnel left Washington on Sunday, Reuters reported, citing a Russian news agency report. “The plane took off, everyone has left,” Reuters quoted the embassy’s press service as saying, from a report in RIA. On Friday, contrary to the view of his foreign ministry, Putin declined to respond to Obama’s move, signalling that he would rather wait to gauge relations with the Trump administration. As is his wont, and to familiar uproar, Trump expressed his approval on Twitter. “Great move on delay (by V. Putin),” he wrote. “I always knew he was very smart!” On Sunday, Spicer, formerly chief strategist and communications director of the Republican National Committee, said Obama’s measures were unlike any “in modern history for any action” and could prove too far-reaching. “I think one of the questions that we have is, why the magnitude of this?” he said. “I mean you look at 35 people being expelled, two sites being closed down, the question is, is that response in proportion to the actions taken?” Spicer and Trump’s comments stand in sharp contrast to views held by Republicans in Congress. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said the White House had “not yet dissuaded [Russia] from attempting to breach our cybersecurity systems, or harass our diplomats in Moscow”. House speaker Paul Ryan called the sanctions “overdue” and “an appropriate way to end eight years of failed policy with Russia”. Leading Republicans have joined calls for a bipartisan congressional investigation. Arizona senator John McCain scheduled a hearing on foreign cyber threats for 5 January, and called senior intelligence officials to testify. On Sunday, speaking in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, McCain said: “We will strongly urge our colleagues toward more meaningful and stronger sanctions against Russia because of their attack on the United States of America.” Spicer also expressed concern that Obama had acted to Trump’s political disadvantage and pointed to what he said was a lack of public response to China’s hacking of the federal government’s network in 2015, breaches that exposed sensitive information belonging to more than 22m federal employees and contractors. “A White House statement wasn’t even issued,” Spicer said. “No action publicly was taken. Nothing, nothing was taken.” He added: “So there is a question about whether there’s a political retribution here versus a diplomatic response.” In his own remarks to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate on Saturday night, Trump again expressed doubt over the US intelligence consensus regarding Russian breaches of Democratic party infrastructure. “I just want them to be sure, because it’s a pretty serious charge,” he said. “If you look at the weapons of mass destruction” – a reference to justification for the invasion of Iraq under George W Bush in 2003 – “that was a disaster, and they were wrong.” Trump, who has long advocated for warmer relations with Russia, pressed his view that the US does not know for sure who was behind the cyber-attacks, which he has suggested could have been carried out by China, another state or “someone sitting on their bed weighing 400lbs”. Asked on Saturday about the reported discovery that Moscow could be behind malware found on a laptop owned by a Vermont electricity utility, Trump questioned the premise. “It could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don’t know so we cannot be sure,” Trump said, adding that more would be revealed on “on Tuesday or Wednesday”. The president-elect is set to meet intelligence officials this week, a meeting to which he agreed after the announcement of the Obama sanctions, despite repeating his wish for the American people to “move on” from the issue. Echoing his vague and much-discussed remarks earlier this week about security in the “age of computer”, he said his 10-year-old could “do anything with a computer”, advocated the use of couriers to transfer information, and said: “I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove.” Responding to Trump’s comments, Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives’ intelligence committee, told ABC the president-elect stood alone in questioning the conclusions of US intelligence agencies. “This is the overwhelming judgment of the intelligence community and, frankly, all of the members of the intelligence committees in Congress, Democrats and Republicans,” Schiff said. “None of us have any question about this. The only one who does, apparently, is Donald Trump.” Schiff warned that Trump would face bipartisan resistance if he tried to lift the Obama sanctions. “The reaction is going to be even more vigorous, I’m convinced, in favor of stronger sanctions against Russia,” Schiff said. “You’re going to see Democrats and Republicans, like McCain and [South Carolina senator Lindsey] Graham and others, come together with a strong [congressional] sanctions package because frankly even though what the administration did was more than symbolic – it was very meaningful – it is not enough to deter Russia.”','https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/01/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-russia-hacking-sean-spicer','Trump spokesman on Russia: president-elect already getting \'wins\' abroad',38),('us-news/2017/jan/01/second-avenue-subway-new-york-new-year','New Yorkers got their first chance to ride a new subway extension on Sunday, after almost 100 years of planning and construction. To loud cheers, the first Q train to run from 96th Street in Manhattan to Coney Island set off soon after noon. New York governor Andrew Cuomo was aboard to celebrate an engineering project his administration has made a matter of state and city pride. “It’s the inaugural ride,” Cuomo told a large crowd who pushed their way into the subway cars. “It’s exciting, and it’s a great way to start the new year here in New York.” The completion of the $4.4bn Second Avenue line – technically a four-stop extension of the Q – is a substantial achievement for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The line was conceived in 1929, at the height of the Jazz Age, and its construction started 45 years ago, in 1972. It stopped soon after when the city ran out of money. The project restarted in 2007 and was completed on time. The nearly two-mile segment adds stations along Second Avenue in the Upper East Side, at 96th, 86th and 72nd streets, and a new connection to an existing line at 63rd. City planners have long considered the extension critical to easing congestion on a system that carries 5.6 million riders on an average weekday. On Sunday, Second Avenue residents expressed excitement over their new mobility but also anxiety over whether the line would hasten gentrification in an area widely regarded as one of the last comparatively affordable spots in Manhattan, a borough where the average apartment price hit $2m last year. “The rents might go up a bit but it’ll bring way more customers to the restaurants on Second Avenue,” said Pam Miller, who was riding the Q with her son, Ben. Makeup artist Toby Klinger, 36, said the extension would make the area more livable. “I’ve been living on Second Avenue almost my whole life and we’re already seeing rapid gentrification,” she said. Klinger rejected the notion that with the help of the new line and the planned closure and renovation of the L train to Brooklyn, the Upper East Side might become a new Williamsburg – home to a surging population of millennials in hipster uniform. “I like being the only hipster,” said Klinger. “It used to be a very diverse neighbourhood with a mixture of white, black, Latino and Arab families, and it’s becoming a place for young professionals to dock their iPhones. The character of the neighbourhood is changing completely.” Alan Behr, a lawyer, said the opening would allow a far easier commute to Midtown. The construction of the line had already changed the neighbourhood, he said, with local stores losing business as a result of the disruption. Behr, 62, doubted the new line would lead to a rapid transformation. “The Upper East Side is a much quieter neighborhood than downtown,” he said. “When a woman was killed in a hit and run at 10.30 at night, nobody saw it because everyone was asleep. “But in New York, when you can get from here to there, it’s always a pro. Anything that gets mass transit running faster is a good. The prices may go up but at least we’re going faster. This is our first new foray into mass transit, and that’s important for us.” Amid the positivity, there were some dissenting voices. Bienvenida Rodriguez, who said she had lived in the neighbourhood for 37 years, said the construction had been “noisy and scary”. “We’ve had explosions,” she said, “sometimes we had no water. It’s been rough for the people living here. I hope now it won’t be dangerous but I’m afraid the homeless will come here now. So we’re praying for the best.” Other passengers, however, noted that the new stations were a vast improvement on the city’s existing stations, many of which date to the early 20th century. The new stations feature striking artwork. At 96th Street, the transportation authority commissioned Sarah Sze, who represented the US at the Venice Biennale in 2013. Her new works use the intense blue of Spanish pottery. At 86th Street, Chuck Close has created 12 large-scale portraits of subjects including composer Philip Glass, the late Lou Reed and three other painters, Cecily Brown, Alex Katz and Kara Walker. Elsewhere, there is work by Vik Muniz, Jean Shin, Zhang Huan and Sienna Shields. “It’s fabulous,” said another passenger, Lauren Michaels. “The trains are bright, the concourse is clean and I’ve been reading about the artwork, which looks pretty interesting. “I like the way they chose a different artist for each station, and actually doing art. Let’s see how it wears.” More than2,000 people worked on the extension, tunneling through granite and digging through sand and mud. The line is also meant to run north through Harlem and ultimately into the Bronx but no date has been set for that phase of construction. “This was a long time coming,” noted Cuomo as the first train pulled out. Disembarking at 86th Street, the governor offered a jovial assessment of his trip. “There’s no steering wheel and no brakes so it was a good thing they wouldn’t let me drive,” said Cuomo, who is reported to be eyeing a 2020 presidential run against another prominent New Yorker, Donald Trump. “I was along for the ride. It was the first ride and it was a great one.”','https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/01/second-avenue-subway-new-york-new-year','Second Avenue subway gives New York reason to cheer – and fear – the new year',20),('us-news/2017/jan/01/standing-rock-protest-minneapolis-nfl-football-game-vikings','In Minneapolis on Sunday protesters unfurled a banner protesting the Dakota Access oil pipeline, high above the field during an NFL game between the Minnesota Vikings and the Chicago Bears. The protest continued through the game, though play was unaffected. The banner, which read “Divest #NoDAPL” and carried the US Bank logo, was hung in the US Bank Stadium by two people. One of the protesters, wearing a No4 Brett Favre Vikings uniform, rappelled down the banner. Members of the media were reportedly sent a message that said the stunt was designed to urge US Bank to divest from the pipeline project, which is run by Energy Transfer Partners, a Dallas-based company. At halftime, stadium manager SMG released a statement that said: “Two individuals appear to have climbed over a guard rail to access the ridge truss. “We immediately dispatched on-site Minneapolis police and fire departments to the scene and cleared the seating section.” The company said it was working to end the protest “with all stadium partners” and with a “primary focus on the safety of the fans and these two individuals”. Construction on the Dakota Access pipeline was halted in North Dakota in December, after months of confrontation between law enforcement agencies and a coalition of Native Americans and environmentalists protesting potential damage to water resources and tribal sites. In December, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune, protesters with similar demands entered Wells Fargo’s offices in the city and blocked employees on their way to work. Protesters also briefly locked doors to a Wells Fargo branch. In 2014, at an All-Star baseball game at Target Field in Minneapolis, a protester gained access to the large video board and unfurled a banner that read: “Love water not oil.” Organisers of Sunday’s protest contended that US Bank has tens of millions of dollars in credit lines active with the pipeline’s parent company. “The pipeline’s route violates treaty rights of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and poses a significant threat drinking water and the health of the Missouri river,” their message to media reportedly said. Despite the decision by the US Army Corps of Engineers to deny a permit for the pipeline to go under the Missouri river near Standing Rock, there are fears that the incoming Trump administration will reverse that decision and permit the the pipeline’s completion. Energy Transfer Partners, in which Trump was revealed to have invested, took the decision to halt construction to court.','https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/01/standing-rock-protest-minneapolis-nfl-football-game-vikings','Standing Rock protesters unfurl banner over field at Minneapolis NFL game',18),('world/2017/jan/01/john-kerrys-challenge-to-israel-on-a-two-state-solution','One state in which a Jewish government rules the entire territory from the Mediterranean to the Jordan and controls a Palestinian Arab population that equals the number of Jews is not the only option. There could be a single state of all its citizens, controlled by a democratically elected parliament and government in the interests of all its citizens (Kerry accuses Israel of undermining peace hopes, 29 December). This would not be a bizarre arrangement. In fact, all civilised nations apart from Israel are governed in this way. Your Q&amp;A section says that “This would effectively be the end of the Jewish homeland, and thus unacceptable to the vast majority of global Jews and many others.” First, the “Jewish homeland” was formed by taking the land of another people, the Palestinians. And most Jews today, as shown by their distribution around the world, have no need for a Jewish homeland. There is also no evidence to show that a single democratic state covering Israel, the West Bank and Gaza would be unacceptable. There are many Jews in the US and the UK who recognise that an ethnically defined state is an anachronism in the modern world. They see that a state of and for all its citizens is the only just route to peace. Even in Israel itself, where the grip of Judaism on the apparatus of state control is increasingly resented by many secular Jews, there is a growing one-state movement. The time has come to face the facts. The rightwing racists who run Israel in the face of all principles of democracy that apply in the rest of the world have to be removed by democratic means so that Israel and Palestine can be governed as one state in the way their citizens deserve. Karl Sabbagh Author, Palestine: A Personal History • The prime minister was absolutely right to criticise John Kerry’s speech on Israel and settlements (Report, 30 December). First, it is legitimate to question why the US secretary of state found it so important to focus his final days in office on Israel’s settlement policy when so much of the world is in flames, so much of the Middle East is in ruins, and when much of that is a direct result of President Obama’s and Kerry’s failures in office. This selectivity in itself invites criticism on the grounds of a lack of even-handedness. Second, while one may disagree with Israel’s settlement policy (as many in Israel do), to suggest that settlements are the obstacle to peace is plainly wrong. Israel had to fight three wars for survival (1948, 1956 and 1967), long before there was an occupation or settlements. In 1967, Israel’s offer to return the territories, in exchange for peace – an offer embedded into UN resolution 242 – was rejected by the Palestinians and Arabs. In 2000, Israel made generous offers to create a Palestinian state, but this too was rejected, and when Israel implemented a unilateral and complete withdrawal from Gaza (2005), all it got in return was a barrage of rockets. The real impediment to peace and to the two-state solution is that the Palestinians (and many Arabs) refuse to concede Israel’s right to exist. They do not dream of a state alongside Israel, but one in place of Israel. The issues are existential, not territorial. Had it been otherwise, the problem would long have been solved, just as it was when Egypt made peace with Israel in 1979. Joshua Rowe Manchester • Reacting to John Kerry’s assessment that Benjamin Netanyahu’s government is the “most rightwing coalition in Israeli history”, Theresa May’s spokesman said she “thought it was not appropriate to focus … solely on the issue of Israeli settlements” and continued: “The government believes that negotiations will only succeed when they are conducted between the two parties, supported by the international community.” The fly in that ointment is that the present creeping annexation of Palestinian territory, while never-ending “negotiations” continue, suits the Netanyahu government. Without external pressure, such as trade and cultural sanctions on Israel, there is nothing to prevent the latticework that is Palestine from being eaten away to the point where it is as no longer viable as a state. Eddie Dougall Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk • In the international angst over Israel it is surely worth remembering those acts of generosity to beleaguered Jews shown by the international community: the Balfour Declaration of 1917, which “favoured the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people”, followed by its implementation through the state of Israel in 1948. To this neutral observer things started to go wrong only when Israel decided in 1967 that it would no longer accept the borders provided for it 19 years earlier. That seems to have been the key action from which the whole tragedy has ensued. Somehow we need to find a way back to first principles on this matter.

Data and anecdote, backed up by doctors and trade unions, suggest the EU’s most chaotic state is in the midst of a public health meltdown. “In the name of tough fiscal targets, people who might otherwise survive are dying,” said Michalis Giannakos who heads the Panhellenic Federation of Public Hospital Employees. “Our hospitals have become danger zones.” Figures released by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control recently revealed that about 10% of patients in Greece were at risk of developing potentially fatal hospital infections, with an estimated 3,000 deaths attributed to them. The occurrence rate was dramatically higher in intensive care units and neonatal wards, the body said. Although the data referred to outbreaks between 2011 and 2012 – the last official figures available – Giannakos said the problem had only got worse. Like other medics who have worked in the Greek national health system since its establishment in 1983, the union chief blamed lack of personnel, inadequate sanitation and absence of cleaning products for the problems. Cutbacks had been exacerbated by overuse of antibiotics, he said. “For every 40 patients there is just one nurse,” he said, mentioning the case of an otherwise healthy woman who died last month after a routine leg operation in a public hospital on Zakynthos. “Cuts are such that even in intensive care units we have lost 150 beds.” “Frequently, patients are placed on beds that have not been disinfected. Staff are so overworked they don’t have time to wash their hands and often there is no antiseptic soap anyway.” No other sector has been affected to the same extent by Greece’s economic crisis. Bloated, profligate and corrupt, for many healthcare was indicative of all that was wrong with the country and, as such, badly in need of reform. Acknowledging the shortfalls, the government announced last month that it planned to appoint more than 8,000 doctors and nurses in 2017. Since 2009, per capita spending on public health has been cut by nearly a third – more than €5bn (£4.3bn) – according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. By 2014, public expenditure had fallen to 4.7% of GDP, from a pre-crisis high of 9.9%. More than 25,000 staff have been laid off, with supplies so scarce that hospitals often run out of medicines, gloves, gauze and sheets. In early December Giannakos, a nurse by training, led a protest march, which started at the grimy building housing the health ministry and ended outside the neoclassical office of the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras. At the ministry, hospital technicians erected a breeze-block wall and from it hung a placard with the words: “The ministry has moved to Brussels.” Few advanced western economies have enacted fiscal adjustment on the scale of Greece. In the six years since it received the first of three bailouts to keep bankruptcy at bay, the country has enforced draconian belt-tightening in return for more than €300bn in emergency loans. The loss of more than 25% of national output – and a recession that has seen ever more people resorting to primary health care – has compounded the corrosive effects of cuts that in the case of public hospitals have often been as indiscriminate as they are deep. Pressure to meet creditor-mandated budget targets means that in 2016 alone, expenditure on the sector has declined by €350m under the stewardship of Syriza, the leftist party that had once railed against austerity, said Giannakos, citing government figures. More than 2.5 million Greeks have been left without any healthcare coverage. Shortages of spare parts are such that scanning machines and other sophisticated diagnostic equipment have become increasingly faulty. Basic blood tests are no longer conducted at most hospitals because laboratory expenditure has been pared back. Wage cuts have worsened the low morale. “The biggest problem is shortage of staff because people are retired and never replaced,” said Dr Yiannis Papadatos, who runs the intensive care unit of one of the three paediatric hospitals in Athens. “Then there’s the problem of equipment and, periodically, lack of supplies like gloves, catheters, and cleaning tissues.” Small acts of heroism have done much to keep the broken system afloat: doctors and nurses work overtime, with donors and philanthropists also helping. Papadatos said: “I was brought up partly in Kenya by parents who emphasised the virtues of helping others. These days I spend a lot of time going round asking friends, or the private sector, for help when our hospital runs out of supplies. The monitors we use to track heart rhythms, blood pressure, that sort of thing, were all donated. People like to give. It makes them feel good.” Unionists argue that healthcare is an easy target because successive governments have refused to properly tackle tax evasion, the biggest drain on public coffers. In a rare public admission, the International Monetary Fund recently conceded that cuts had been so brutal “basic public services such as transport and healthcare are being compromised”. But at a time when the Greek debt crisis has flared again, after Tsipras’s controversial announcement of a series of welfare benefits, there are many who fear worse is to come. One of them is British-trained Dr Michalis Samarakos, who believes that while the health system is in need of further reform it also runs the risk of running out of specialists and clinical trainees. Already there has been a massive exodus of doctors abroad, mostly to Germany and the UK, as a result of lack of opportunity. “The best are leaving because their potential cannot be developed here,” he said. “I can see it teaching sixth-year students at Athens University, everyone wants a reference, everyone wants to go. “It’s become a growing problem. We don’t have nephrologists, for example, because there are no prospects for specialists, either in or out of the system [in private practice]. “Trainee doctors are the backbone of any hospital – without them hospitals can’t function. Unless there is a big change, I worry greatly that things can only become worse.”','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/01/patients-dying-greece-public-health-meltdown','\'Patients who should live are dying\': Greece\'s public health meltdown',40),('world/2017/jan/01/russian-envoys-leave-us-hack-sanctions-putin-trump-cia','A plane carrying 35 Russian diplomats, expelled from the United States over Moscow’s alleged interference in the presidential election, took off from Washington on Sunday, Russian news agencies reported. “The plane has taken off. Everyone is on board,” said the Russian embassy in Washington, quoted by the state-owned Ria Novosti agency. Relatives of the diplomats were also on board, making 96 in all. The expulsions were part of a package of sanctions ordered by President Barack Obama on Thursday. US intelligence says the Kremlin ordered a hack-and-release of emails from within the Democratic party and Hillary Clinton’s campaign in an effort to put Donald Trump in the Oval Office. Moscow has denied the allegations. Thirty-five Russians, described as intelligence operatives based at the Russian embassy in Washington and the consulate in San Francisco, were given 72 hours to leave the country. Obama also ordered the closure of two Russian compounds in New York and Maryland that the US says are used for intelligence-related purposes. Economic sanctions were also announced against Russia’s FSB and GRU intelligence agencies. President Vladimir Putin has ruled out sending home US diplomats in retaliation – a move interpreted as a sign that he is looking to Trump to rebuild US-Russian ties after his inauguration on 20 January. On Saturday, Donald Trump again expressed his scepticism over whether Russia was responsible for the computer hacks. In remarks to reporters upon entering a New Year’s Eve celebration at his Mar-a-Lago estate on Saturday night, Trump warned against being quick to pin the blame on Russia. “I just want them to be sure, because it’s a pretty serious charge,” he said. “And if you look at the weapons of mass destruction, that was a disaster, and they were wrong.” US intelligence officials have said that they are confident Russia was behind the US election hacks , which could have played a role in Trump’s defeat over Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The Washington Post also reported on Friday that Moscow could be behind malware found on a laptop owned by a Vermont electricity utility. In response to that discovery, Vermont governor Peter Shumlin said: “One of the world’s leading thugs, Vladimir Putin, has been attempting to hack our electric grid, which we rely upon to support our quality of life, economy, health, and safety.” At Mar-a-Lago, Trump said: “I think it’s unfair if we don’t know. It could be somebody else. I also know things that other people don’t know, so we cannot be sure.” Asked what that information included, the president-elect said: “You will find out on Tuesday or Wednesday.” He did not elaborate, although in a statement released on Thursday in response to Obama’s sanctions, he said he would meet intelligence officials.','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/01/russian-envoys-leave-us-hack-sanctions-putin-trump-cia','Russian envoys leave US after sanctions for alleged hacks',2),('world/2017/jan/01/turkey-nightclub-shooting-reina-nightclub-istanbul-victims-search-continues','Istanbul is on high alert as the hunt for a gunman, who fled after killing 39 people at a nightclub on New Year’s Eve, continues. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan vowed in a statement that Turkey would fight terrorism “till the end” following the attack at Reina in Istanbul’s upmarket Ortaköy neighbourhood. “Turkey will stand together and not give passage to dirty games of terrorists,” he said. Mehmet Görmez, Turkey’s most senior Muslim cleric, condemned the attack as “savagery” and a “massacre that no Muslim conscience can accept”. There was condemnation from around the world as well as inside Turkey. The US State Department described the attack as “heinous” and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said it was “hard to imagine a more cynical crime”. The attack came at the end of a year of terrorist incidents across Europe, including the driving of a truck into a Christmas market in Berlin earlier in December. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, sent her condolences to the victims of the Istanbul attack, saying “terrorists ... have carried out an inhumane and devious attack on people who wanted to celebrate the new year together”. A Downing Street spokesman said Theresa May had written to Erdoğan after the attack to offer her condolences. “She said her thoughts were with the Turkish people after this further devastating terrorist attack, and confirms the UK stands ready to help,” No 10 said. In his new year’s address, Pope Francis said: “Unfortunately, violence has stricken even in this night of good wishes and hope. Pained, I express my closeness to the Turkish people. I pray for the many victims and for the wounded and for the entire nation in mourning. “I ask the Lord to sustain all men of good will to courageously roll up their sleeves to confront the plague of terrorism and this stain of blood that is covering the world with a shadow of fear and a sense of loss.” The gunman entered Reina, a club on the Bosphorus that has long been a favourite of tourists, a little after 1am, shot a police officer and then opened fire inside the club with a Kalashnikov rifle, before fleeing the scene. Istanbul’s governor, Vasip Şahin, told reporters: “At 1.15am, a terrorist carrying a long-barrelled weapon martyred the police officer waiting outside, and then martyred another citizen to enter. He then carried out this violent and cruel act by spraying bullets on innocent people who were celebrating the new year.” The interior minister, Süleyman Soylu, said the gunman was still at large, after reports initially said the attacker was killed. Police were deployed around key areas of the city and several roads near the scene of the attack were closed off. Witnesses described scenes of chaos as revellers attempted to flee, some even throwing themselves into the Bosphorus to escape the gunfire. Outside Şişli Etfal hospital, Sinem Uyanık said she had been at the club with her husband, who was wounded in the attack. “Before I could understand what was happening, my husband fell on top me,” she told Associated Press. “I had to lift several bodies from on top of me before I could get out. It was frightening.” She said her husband’s condition was not serious. It was unclear how the attacker managed to escape from the club, which is just across the street from a police station. One report suggested he abandoned his weapon and mingled with the crowd outside pretending to be an injured civilian. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack. Turkey’s prime minister, Binali Yıldırım, said an investigation into the identity of the gunman was ongoing but he was not prepared to share details yet. There was conflicting information on Sunday evening about the identities of the foreigners who were killed in the attack. Selin Doğan, an opposition politician from Istanbul who toured the hospitals and the morgue at the forensic institute, said the dead included citizens from Saudi Arabia, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Tunisia, Kuwait and Israel, as well as a Belgian-Turkish dual national and a Canadian-Iraqi. The Jordanian foreign ministry said three of its citizens were also killed in the attack. Among the victims was a Tunisian couple and twins from Saudi Arabia. Doğan said the dead all had gunshot wounds and that 11 bodies had been delivered to their families. Turkey has endured numerous terror attacks over the past year by Islamic State militants and Kurdish separatist groups. Three weeks ago a twin bombing outside the football stadium in the district of Beşiktaş killed 46 people, most of them police officers, two hours after a football match. The latest attack has again shaken a country that endured a string of high profile bombings, including in the busy Atatürk airport last summer and near the Hagia Sophia mosque, as well as an attempted military coup in July. Shortly after the nightclub attack, relatives of local staff gathered outside the police cordon to await news of their loved ones. Two men collapsed in tears and sobbed upon receiving news that a relative had died in the attack. Another man who was in the club described a chaotic scene with people rushing for the exits, but was in too much shock to offer a detailed account of the assault. At the forensic institute in Istanbul, some families gathered to collect the bodies of the victims. Stephanie Deek, a Lebanese woman, said her friend was with her husband at the club when the attack happened. “They were just tourists, married for five months, and they wanted to find the perfect place to spend New Year’s Eve,” said Deek. The husband, a 35-year old Lebanese man called Haykal Musallem, was in the bathroom when the attack began. His wife rushed out of the club, while he apparently attempted to jump into the Bosphorus to flee, but was killed. “I’m feeling so sad,” she said. “I can’t even talk or express my feelings.” But there was also anger at what some saw as heightened polarisation and rhetoric in the run-up to the attack. Conservative clerics and media outlets have railed against the sinfulness of new year’s celebrations in recent days. Tabloid newspapers with deeply religious audiences ran headlines such as: “This is a last warning: do not celebrate” and: “Down with your civilisation” with images of party-goers next to images of deprivation in Syria, where nearly half a million people have been killed in an ongoing civil war. The target of the attack prompted some observers to see it as directed against Turkey’s secular character, in the midst of an ongoing struggle to define the republic’s identity. Akif Hamzaçebi, a lawmaker from the Republican People’s party (CHP), described the assault as an “attack on a way of life” and and said it was “savage”. “The aim is to plant seeds of hatred among society,” he said, speaking after visiting the wounded in Istanbul’s Şişli Etfal hospital. “We do not want to live with the acceptance of terror and the state should teach a lesson to the terrorist organisations.” An influential CHP deputy from Istanbul, Gürsel Tekin, said at the hospital: “In the coming days we should be talking about this – in the last week there were so many messages which can damage our social peace but none of these messages were investigated. Those responsible should resign.” Gülsin Harman contributed to this report','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/01/turkey-nightclub-shooting-reina-nightclub-istanbul-victims-search-continues','Turkey nightclub shooting: Istanbul mourns as police hunt gunman',25),('world/2017/jan/02/beautiful-and-doomed-new-zealands-capital-begins-the-fight-of-its-life','Ringed by golden beaches and temperate Pacific seas, Kaitaia is unconscionably pretty, dotted with flaming red pohutukawa trees and blessed by year-round blue skies. The town of 5,000 people on the northern tip of New Zealand’s North Island should be known as a holiday resort, but instead it has been dubbed the murder capital of New Zealand after four homicides and six suicides in a single year. “It is like the town has become haunted,” says Nina Griffiths, 18, who lost two friends to suicide this year. “People say you have to get out of Kaitaia, you have to get out of this shithole. There is a sense of hopelessness if you stay here ... we don’t feel like our lives are valued enough to put effort in to save them, and make sure this never happens again.” Kaitaia is the last major stop on state highway one in the far north; 300km from Auckland or a $150 plane ticket out. Half the town earn less than NZ$20,000 a year, and 60% are Maori, with unemployment at more than double the national average. While it is pretty, the town is also remote, poor and increasingly stigmatised as the place dreams go to die. “We are a community that feels doomed,” said He Korowai trust chief executive Ricky Houghton in October, still reeling from the suicide of his nephew, and four other young men aged under 25. “If these deaths happened anywhere else in New Zealand it would be front-page news - a crisis. But because it’s Kaitaia we’re forgotten, no one cares what happens to us. People think there is no future for the people here.” Senior leaders openly acknowledge that Kaitaia has a range of entrenched and long-standing social problems, including a lack of viable employment, isolation and strong gang and drug links. But they also say 2016’s glut of deaths may finally prove a turning point for their “forgotten” town – that the deaths have spurred a formerly broken community to unite and stick up for itself in a way they haven’t seen in decades. Earlier this year, Kaitaia fire chief Colin Kitchen considered quitting his job after attending two hangings and a stabbing homicide in a 24-hour-period. “Our town has been knocked for sure, we’re still in shock. When it happens once or twice, well sadly that is expected, but when it keeps happening you think ‘what the hell is going on here?’ I did feel at one point that I would have to walk away from it, that I’d had enough,” says Kitchen, who has been with the fire brigade for more than four decades. “But if we stepped away from it, who would look after our community, and what kind of message would that send, if the leaders desert? I think this year has been so bad it’s been a wake-up call, and I am finally starting to see things turn around. The town is getting stronger and regrouping.” By August six people killed by their own hand had passed through the Kaitaia morgue. With some of the strictest guidelines in the world for the media reporting on suicides, the slew of “sudden deaths” fuelled Kaitaia’s reputation as the murder capital of New Zealand, and rumours in town twisted and warped, with some hearing as many as 15 people had died. Griffiths was feeling sick to the guts. Traumatised by the futility of her friends’ lives so bluntly ended, but also frustrated by the community’s initial response – which she describes as muted and repressed, with people referring to the deaths as “passings” instead of suicides and murders. Griffiths felt Kaitaia – and young people especially – had two options: implode, or change, fast. “This town is so small everyone was affected by the deaths, literally everyone,” says Griffiths, who has received a NZ$10,000 AMP scholarship to set up a youth space in town, intended as a retreat for vulnerable kids. “People are always asking me when we go away for sports events and stuff – ‘oh so you’re from the murder capital.’ And that doesn’t help us feel better about ourselves, or our town. It makes us feel really embarrassed of where we live and this past year there has not been a lot of pride around here.” In July Griffiths contacted comedian and mental health advocate Mike King, begging him to travel north and facilitate a straight-up conversation about suicide in Kaitaia. Suicide professionals tried to dissuade her, as they had attempted to dissuade King when he visited in 2013, saying discussing the deaths in a public forum could inspire copycats or “stir up emotions”. But Griffiths ignored their warnings and went ahead with the meeting – attended by hundreds – all desperately seeking guidance from King on how to stem the flow of young lives. King and Griffiths say most of the suicide prevention teams in Kaitaia refused to attend. “I know for a fact that Nina got a lot of flak for organising the meetings, and told she was a silly little girl who didn’t know what she was doing,” says King. “But she was absolutely right, her approach is backed up by the latest research, that talking about suicide is what communities need to do. There are a lot of young people up there who feel like no one cares about them, and no one loves them, they feel hopeless. Until that is addressed and brought into the light, the stats will continue to rise.” Griffiths’s determination to face the deaths head-on may have inspired others to reject the mounting negativity surrounding their town, and since August a small but perceptible change has begun, with no more homicides or suicides recorded. The Facebook group ‘I love Kaitaia’ has hundreds of members, and bumper stickers and T-shirts with the slogan are worn proudly by the town’s residents. Musicians have written songs extolling the virtues of their Far North paradise, and trees have been strung with streamers; the once-weed strewn garden beds planted with red and pink geraniums. Formal and informal mentoring and guardian relationships are also tentatively being broached. In a coup for the town, last week the Warriors rugby league team flew in on the royal air force DC3 for a three-day visit, with the sole mission of lifting morale. “Being dubbed the murder capital made people really angry, and they wanted to fight back, because we love our home,” Griffiths says. “We don’t want to be defined by death.” In New Zealand, crisis helplines can be found here.

I had always loved swimming but had to give it up until my mother bought some Lycra fabric from Lincraft and sewed me a fluorescent pink-and-blue two-piece wetsuit with a matching swimming cap. The local pools refused to admit me wearing the suit but I was free to go to the beach. So go to the beach I did. And yet the feeling that I belonged at the beach, that it was a public space in which I was “in place”, sometimes eluded me. The belief that the beach is open to all runs deep in Australia. Wendy Garden, the curator of last year’s art exhibition On the Beach, wrote that beaches occupied “a privileged place in the national psyche”. “The beach is seen as a great equaliser, where racial, social and gender differences are subordinate to the common pursuit of pleasure in the surf and sun.” But like many of our public spaces, the iconic space of the Australian beach has always privileged a white sensory landscape. What looks and feels and sounds and smells as though it belongs is a function of power relations. Since last summer, events in Europe have sharpened potential conflicts over who and what belongs on the beach. After the terrorist attack in Nice in May, French mayors banned women from wearing burkinis on the beach in dozens of resorts and promised to defy a court ruling that the bans were illegal. At least one woman was fined by police for not wearing an outfit deemed to respect “good morals and secularism”. No such legal moves have been seriously proposed for Australian beaches but the climate is far from relaxed. Speaking to Muslim women from diverse walks of life about their relationship with the beach, what is striking is how their bodies, specifically their dress, have become the dominant site for contests over what is considered “in place” and “out of place” on Australian beaches. Whether it be a hijab over a rash vest and activewear leggings, or the burkini, it seems that the “Muslimness” of this form of dress has the capacity to provoke wary and sometimes hostile reactions. Many of the women I spoke to had a sense that their burkinis and hijabs were considered “out of place”. The staring, the double looks, the raised eyebrows. “It’s this feeling that the beach and hijab don’t mix,” says Sarah, a 28-year-old lawyer (all interviewees asked for full names to be withheld). “People are locked into thinking there’s only one way to dress and enjoy the beach.” Samah laughs when she tells me that before owning a burkini, she wore tights, a long shirt and hijab to swim in and “lay on the sand”. “One time a guy looked at me while we were in the water,” she recounts. “He shook his head with pity and said, ‘Isn’t it a shame you can’t enjoy the sun?’ I laughed it off and responded that I was enjoying the sun. “Mind you, the guy was wearing a long-sleeve rashie and swim cap. I had more skin exposed than he did!” Growing up in Queensland, the beach has always been part of Aisha’s life. But when she started wearing hijab, she says she stopped feeling comfortable because of “how people would stare”. She opted for secluded beaches despite her concerns about swimming in places with no flags or lifeguards. “It was the only way I could feel at ease to swim,” she says. For some the beach has become the opposite of the peculiarly relaxed space of Australian myth. Hana, a 25-year-old journalist, was on the northern beaches of Sydney last month and interpreted the stares she received as a kind of “disgust” that questioned her right even to be on the beach. She says she decided against wearing her burkini and “watered down” her outfit of swimming cap, black tights with board shorts on top and long-sleeve rash vest, to make it less “confronting”. “I can go anywhere in Australia and I feel so comfortable,” she says, “but the beach is the one place that I am fearful of because of the reaction I always receive.” The norms and rules that have been allowed to dominate Australian beaches mean a bathing suit is internalised as natural, much in the same way that in India it is perfectly “natural” for women to wear saris and swim in the ocean. In Egypt, women jump into the Mediterranean wearing their hijabs or niqabs without issue. Another woman, Az, says it is not the job of Muslim women to prove they belong on Australian beaches. What is needed is to hold the mirror up to society and understand why we deem some forms of dress acceptable and others unacceptable. Yet many Muslim women do struggle to overcome the attitudes of others. Sana spent years on what she describes as “a journey of confidence-building” to wear a burkini at the beach. For years she chose not to wear it because she grew up “with a feeling that only people who dress and look a certain way have claim to the beach. The beach is a space which, due to so many societal factors, is synonymous with whiteness, blond-haired, sunburnt-white skin and definitely not fully dressed women.” This is about much more than bikinis v burkinis. Muslim women are particularly aware that what they wear on the beach and how they behave can be used as ammunition for wider culture wars about a mythical “Australian way of life” and “Aussie values”. Anisa is married with three children and her concerns about being a “hijabi at the beach” have deepened since the French bans. “Some women are brave and don’t care,” she says, “but I feel so self-conscious and as though people are judging me and my husband because he’s wearing ‘appropriate’ swimwear whereas I am fully covered. “You can almost feel how they are viewing us as this controlling Muslim man and his poor oppressed wife – if only they knew the real dynamics!” A cultural studies professor, Suvendini Perera, has argued that veiling has become the ultimate marker of cultural difference and that the veiled Muslim woman is “a kind of limit-figure for the nation in the values debate”. It is the awareness that their bodies are repositories for other people’s narratives and stereotypes that burdens all the women I spoke to. And yet many Muslim women resist the negative responses of others to lay claim to their beach space. Abs tells me she “self-counsels” herself: “I constantly tell myself not to care what others are thinking of my appearance. This self-counselling empowers me to enjoy myself and my time with my children.” Samar is just as resolved to ignore the “stares and weird looks” and “rock the burkini when I’m swimming”. For Layla, for whom the beach “washes away stress and anxiety”, presumptions that she cannot swim and is “weighed down” by her burkini only make her laugh. It’s not simply that these women use the beach in spite of being positioned as “out of place”. They seek to redefine “out of place”, challenging dominant assumptions and sensory reactions to their presence. Layla’s relationship with the beach has evolved from a site of resistance to the staring and comments, to a place which she says she has “trained myself to think of as my space too”.','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/02/burkinis-and-belonging-its-this-feeling-the-beach-and-hijab-dont-mix','Burkinis and belonging: \'It\'s this feeling the beach and hijab don\'t mix\'',19),('world/live/2017/jan/01/istanbul-nightclub-attack-dozens-killed-new-years-eve-mass-shooting-live-updates','Several foreigners including many nationals of Arab countries were among the dead, officials said on Sunday. AFP have put together a breakdown of the nationality of the dead and wounded known so far given by their respective countries. Saudi Arabia – Riyadh’s consulate in Istanbul said that Saudis were among the victims, but gave no figures. The Asharq Al-Awsat newspaper however quoted a consulate source as saying that five Saudis including two women had died and 11 other people were injured. Al-Arabiya television also spoke of five dead and nine wounded. Jordan – The foreign ministry in Amman said three Jordanians were killed and four injured, the official Petra news agency reported. Iraq – A spokesman for Iraq’s foreign ministry said that three Iraqis died in the attack. Lebanon – The Lebanese foreign ministry announced the death of three Lebanese and said another four were wounded. “I was saved by my passport which I was carrying right near my heart,” one of the injured, Francois al-Asmar, told Lebanese television from his hospital bed. Tunisia – The Tunisian foreign ministry said on its Facebook page that two Tunisians died, with media reports saying the victims were a businessman and his wife. India – India’s external affairs minister said two nationals were among the dead, naming them as Abis Rizvi, the son of a former MP, and a woman, Khushi Shah. Israel – The Israeli foreign ministry said a young Arab Israeli woman, 18-year-old Lian Nasser, had died. Belgium – Belgium’s foreign ministry confirmed that a man in his 20s, a Belgian-Turkish dual national, was killed. France – Paris said a French-Tunisian dual national woman had died along with her Tunisian husband. It was not immediately known if they were among the dead listed by Tunis. Another three French people were injured, the foreign ministry said. Libya – One Libyan was killed and three others hurt in the attack, according to the north African country’s foreign ministry. Morocco – Three Moroccans were wounded, the MAP news agency quoted the embassy in Ankara as saying. Hello, Nicola Slawson here in London, taking over from Jamie. Here’s an update from our correspondent, Kareem Shaheen, in Istanbul: One important question that has been raised is how the assailant managed to escape even though the police response was quite swift to the attack, since there is a police station just across the street from Reina. There are over 300 security cameras in the club and the surrounding area so investigators are combing through security cam footage. One theory, believed by some who have seen some of the footage, is that the attacker, who left his gun at the scene, may have pretended to be an injured civilian in the immediate aftermath and chaos. A manhunt is on for an attacker who shot dead 39 people and wounded 69 others during a New Year’s Eve celebration at an upmarket Istanbul nightclub. Turkish officials said it was a lone gunman but some survivors described seeing multiple attackers. A Turkish opposition MP said at least 24 of those killed were foreign nationals, higher than the 15 cited by Turkish interior minister Suleyman Soylu. CHP MP said 11 Turks, seven Saudi Arabians, three Iraqis, two Lebanese, two Tunisian, two Indian and a Kuwaiti, a Syrian, and an Israelis are among the dead. A Belgian citizen who is originally Turkish, and a Canadian-Iraqi were also killed, she said. The Jordanian foreign ministry said three of its citizens were killed. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack on the Reina club,which is thought to have had up to 600 people inside at the time. The club is an exclusive hotspot popular with tourists and local residents that sits on the bank of the eastern side of the Bosphorus. President Tayyip Erdoğan said Turkey would “fight to the end” against all forms of terrorism. He accused the perpetrators of trying to “create chaos, demoralise our people, and destabilise our country”. Witnesses reported a rush for the exits, bodies lying on the floor and people jumping into the water to escape the gunman. One survivor said the gunman shouted “Allahu Akbar” (God is greatest) during the attack. There has been condemnation from across the world with the US State Department describing it as “heinous” and Barack Obama offering his condolences. The Russian president Vladimir Putin said it was “hard to imagine a more cynical crime” and Pope Francis said he was praying for the victims. Leanne Nasser, 19, from the Israeli-Arab town of Tira Nasser was killed while celebrating with three friends. Her friend Ruaa Mansour, also 18, was moderately wounded in the attack. The other two friends were unharmed. A Lebanese man, Haykal Musallem, was at the club with his wife of five months when he was killed, a friend said. A security guard at the club, Fatih Çakmak, Turkish police officer, Burak Yildiz, 22, and 47-year-old travel agent Ayhan Arik, were also reportedly killed. Çakmak reportedly survived twin bombings outside a football stadium in Istanbul on 10 December, which killed 45 people. Mehmet Görmez, Turkey’s most senior cleric, has condemned the attack as “savagery” and a “massacre that no Muslim conscience can accept”. Conservative politicians and media who criticised the concept of New Year celebrations have come under scrutiny in the wake of the attack. An opposition politician called for those responsible for “messages which can damage our social peace” to resign. France’s foreign minister says one French citizen was killed and three others wounded in the New Year’s shooting attack at a crowded Istanbul nightclub, AP reports. Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said in a statement that a woman with both French and Tunisian citizenship died in the attack early Sunday. Ayrault says the woman’s Tunisian husband also died. Due to the presence of French citizens among the casualties, the Paris prosecutor’s office says it has opened a criminal investigation for “terrorist murders and attempted murders.” An assailant opened fire at the Reina nightclub during New Year’s celebrations, killing at least 39 people. Turkish authorities said foreigners from “many different nationalities” are among the wounded in the attack. French President Francois Hollande says in a statement that France “will pitilessly pursue the fight” against terrorism with its allies. Hi, Jamie Grierson in London here, taking over from Haroon. Here’s some updated advice from the UK’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). A brief statement on the department’s website reads: On 1 January 2017, there was an attack on the Reina nightclub in Ortakoy, Istanbul, causing a large number of casualties. There is an ongoing police operation in Istanbul as a result of the attack, and the attacker may still be at large. You should exercise vigilance and caution at this time, and follow the advice and instructions of the security authorities. Charbel Wardini, from Lebanon, told AP that his 26-year-old brother, Elias, was among those killed in the attack. He said: I lost my brother because of terrorism. If you tell me terrorism, I will go fight against them. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said seven Lebanese were wounded in the attack. Lebanon’s foreign ministry reported earlier that the daughter of member of parliament Estephan El Douaihy was among those injured. The Lebanese government plans to send a jet to Istanbul on Sunday night with a medical team and relatives of the wounded in order to bring them back to Beirut. The foreign ministry in Amman has said three Jordanians were killed and four injured, the official Petra news agency reported. At the forensic institute in Istanbul, Kareem Shaheen spoke to Stephanie Deek, a Lebanese woman whose friend was with her husband, Haykal Musallem, at Reina when the attack happened. Musallem was killed. Deek said: They were just tourists, married for five months, and they wanted to find the perfect place to spend New Year’s Eve. She said when the attack happened the husband was in the bathroom and the wife at the table. She ran out when the shooting started but the husband was caught in the midst of the attack and died. Deek tried to contact them as soon as she heard of the attack, and was there to try and identify the body but had to wait outside and was visibly agitated. She said: I’m feeling so sad. I can’t even talk or express my feelings. Selina Dogan, a CHP [the main opposition party] MP who toured the hospitals and the morgue, said 11 Turks, 24 foreign nationals and four whose nationality has yet to be ascertained were killed in the attack. She said the nationalities of the dead included Saudi Arabian (seven) Iraqi (three), Lebanese (two), Tunisian (two) Indian (two) and one each from Kuwait, Syria, and Israel. A Belgian citizen who is originally Turkish, and a Canadian-Iraqi were also killed. One of the Kuwaiti wounded told visitors that the assailant was shouting “Allahu Akbar” (God is greatest). The survivors they spoke to all said there were multiple assailants, although Turkish authorities have said there was a lone attacker, and some said they were in contact with each other on walkie talkies. All of the dead had gun wounds caused by a Kalashnikov assault rifle. Of the dead, 25 are men and 14 women. Eleven bodies have already been handed over to their families for burial. Two of the dead are believed to be Saudi twins but they haven’t been formally identified yet. Five Saudi citizens were killed in the attack and 10 more injured, according to the al-Riyhadh website (Arabic link), quoting the country’s acting consul general in Istanbul. Another Lebanese man, Haykal Mousallem, was killed in the attack, his relatives have told Reuters. Earlier, the family of Elias Wardini told Lebanon’s New TV that they had been officially informed of his death. Lebanon’s National News Agency said several other Lebanese nationals were wounded in the attack. Turkish media say the victims of the attack include a police officer and a travel agent, AP reports. State-run Anadolu news agency reported that the body of 22-year-old police officer Burak Yildiz was en route to his hometown in the southern city of Mersin. Yildiz, who had been on the force for one-and-a-half years, was shot and killed outside the Reina nightclub. Private Dogan news agency reports that 47-year-old travel agent Ayhan Arik, a father of two, was another of the first victims of the early morning attack. The news agency says the gunman shot Arik in the head outside the club. The Turkish prime minister has also said the reports that the attacker was dressed as Santa Claus are untrue. Turkish authorities are starting to uncover evidence about the attack on the Reina nightclub but there is no clarity yet on who was responsible, Turkish prime minister Binali Yildirim said. When asked by reporters who might have been behind it, he answered: Some details have started emerging, but the authorities are working towards a concrete result. Police and security officials will share information as it becomes available during the investigation. Israeli, Lebanese, Libyan, Moroccan, and Saudi Arabian citizens were among 39 people killed when a gunman opened fire in an Istanbul nightclub during a New Year’s Eve celebration, Turkish authorities said. Another 69 people were injured. At least 15 of the dead are believed to be foreign nationals. Interior minister Süleyman Soylu said that the gunman was still on the run, contrary to earlier statements by authorities that the assailant had been killed. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack on the Reina club, which is thought to have had up to 600 people inside at the time. The club is an exclusive hotspot popular with tourists and local residents that sits on the bank of the western side of the Bosphorus. President Tayyip Erdoğan said Turkey would “fight to the end” against all forms of terrorism. He accused the perpetrators of trying to “create chaos, demoralise our people, and destabilise our country”. The city’s governor, Vasip Sahin, said the attacker, armed with a long-barrelled weapon, killed a policeman and a civilian outside the Reina club at about 1.45am before moving inside. Video footage showed an apparent assailant dressed in black, in contradiction to a report suggesting he was wearing a Santa Claus costume. Witnesses reported a rush for the exits, bodies lying on the floor and people jumping into the water to escape the gunman. The club’s owner said extra security measures had been brought in in the past 10 days after US intelligence reports suggested a possible attack on crowded places in the city. There has been condemnation from across the world with the US State Department describing it as “heinous” and Barack Obama offering his condolences. The Russian president Vladimir Putin said it was “hard to imagine a more cynical crime” and Pope Francis said he was praying for the victims. Leanne Nasser, 19, from the Israeli-Arab town of Tira Nasser was killed while celebrating with three friends. Her friend Ruaa Mansour, also 18, was moderately wounded in the attack. The other two friends were unharmed. Mehmet Görmez, Turkey’s most senior cleric, has condemned the attack as “savagery” and a “massacre that no Muslim conscience can accept”. Conservative politicians and media who criticised the concept of New Year celebrations have come under scrutiny in the wake of the attack. An opposition politician called for those responsible for “messages which can damage our social peace” to resign. The family of a Lebanese citizen who went missing after an attack in a nightclub in Istanbul said they have received news he was among those killed, Lebanon’s New TV reported. The channel said the family had been officially informed of Elias Wardini’s death. These pictures show flowers left at the scene of the attack. Some of the marginal newspapers with a very conservative following like Akit and Milli Gazete published front page features yesterday on NYE celebrations. In Milli the headline was: “This is the last warning, don’t celebrate”. In Akit, the front page said “Down with your civilisation”, with pictures side by side of people in Syria and people partying. An influential CHP deputy from Istanbul, Gursel Tekin, said at the hospital: In the coming days we should be talking about this - in the last week there were so many messages which can damage our social peace but none of these messages were investigated. Those responsible should resign. This is a list of terrorist attacks in Turkey since the summer of 2015, via the New York Times: This is the scene at Sisli Etfal hospital where wounded and survivors were taken last night. There are few families as the nightclub is a known destination for foreigners, so many of the casualties do nOt have family here. Many roads in the city are closed off as they search for the attackers. There are two foreigners at the hospital who are wounded and in a critical condition. There is also a wounded Turkish man who was shot in his spine and is getting psychological support and treatment. Opposition CHP lawmaker Akif Hamzacebe described the assault as an “attack on a way of life” and and said it was “savage”. “The aim is to plant seeds of hatred among society,” he said. “We do not want to live with the acceptance of terror and the state should teach a lesson to the terrorist organisations.” It is important to note that many conservatives prior to the attack were decrying the sinfulness of NYE celebrations and so some people see the attack as notable from a cultural point of view, hence the comment about it being an attack on a way of life, almost an attack on Turkey’s secular character. An MHP lawmaker who visited the hospital described the dead as “martyrs”. “Those who committed this action against the stability of the Turkish state will drown in their own blood,” he said. The Reina nightclub has long been a magnet to the rich and famous, my colleague Robert Booth writes: Open since 2002, the venue on the banks of the Bosphorus has earned a reputation as the place to be seen among Turkey’s young, secular elite who recline on its white banquettes and are served ice buckets of drinks by aproned waiters. It attracts footballers from the top Turkish sides and stars from the country’s popular soap operas, as well as tourists and businesspeople from around the world. Daniel Craig, Kylie Minogue, Naomi Watts and Jon Bon Jovi are among the celebrities named as having been guests at the club, according to GC Prive, a London wealth management company that recommends the venue to its clients. The funeral of Ayhan Arik, one of the victims of the attack at the Reina nightclub, has been taking place in Istanbul. Arik reportedly drove tourists to the club. Islamic custom is to bury people as soon as possible after their death. This video shows bullets ricocheting outside the Reina nightclub and a man who appears to be the attacker. It suggests that reports that the attacker was wearing a Santa Claus suit are wrong, as he appears to be dressed all in black. A number of people have said that the attack on the nightclub came amid criticism in Turkey of New Year’s celebrations from some who consider them incompatible with Islam. In his traditional New Year address, Pope Francis has urged leaders to work together to fight the “plague of terrorism” in the wake of events in Turkey. Speaking to 50,000 people in St. Peter’s Square, Francis departed from his prepared text to condemn the Istanbul nightclub attack that killed at least 39 people. He said: Unfortunately, violence has stricken even in this night of good wishes and hope. Pained, I express my closeness to the Turkish people. I pray for the many victims and for the wounded and for the entire nation in mourning. I ask the Lord to sustain all men of good will to courageously roll up their sleeves to confront the plague of terrorism and this stain of blood that is covering the world with a shadow of fear and a sense of loss. The pro-Kurdish HDP, Turkey’s third largest party, has condemned the Istanbul attack: The US embassy in Turkey has sought to clarify the details of a travel warning it issued on 22 December, saying “it had no information about threats to specific entertainment venues, including the Reina club”, despite social media rumours to the contrary. Turkey’s top cleric has said there is no difference between a terrorist attack on a “place of worship or in an entertainment place”. The Turkish family minister has said that Saudi Arabian, Moroccan, Lebanese and Libyan nationals were also among the victims of the attack The Israeli foreign ministry has said that an Israeli woman was killed in the attack. She is Leanne Nasser, 19, from the Israeli-Arab town of Tira. Nasser was celebrating with three friends at the Reina nightclub when the gunman broke in and opened fire. Her friend Ruaa Mansour, also 18, was moderately wounded in the attack. The other two friends were unharmed. The president of the European Commission has sent his condolences to Turkey. The UK government has updated its travel advice for Turkey in the wake of the attack. It says: On 1 January 2017, there was an attack on the Reina nightclub in Ortakoy, Istanbul, causing a large number of casualties. There is an ongoing police operation in Istanbul as a result of the attack, and the attacker may still be at large. You should exercise vigilance and caution at this time, and follow the advice and instructions of the security authorities. Turkish website the Daily Sabah reports that a man killed in the attack at Reina nightclub had survived twin bombings outside a football stadium in Istanbul on 10 December, which killed 45 people. It says that Fatih Çakmak was on duty at the nightclub during the New Year celebrations and was also working at the match between Beşiktaş and Bursaspor last month. He escaped the bombing, which occurred after the match ended, unharmed, according to the Daily Sabah only to die in last night’s attack. Human Rights Watch executive director Kenneth Roth has tweeted a map showing the number of deaths from terrorist attacks in Turkey over the past 18 months (Istanbul is in the north-west corner): Unsurprisingly, there is still a heavy police presence at the scene of the atrocity. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has joined in the international condemnation of the attack in Turkey. He said: “It is hard to imagine a more cynical crime than the murder of innocent civilians in the midst of New Year’s holiday. But the terrorists are absolutely alien to the concept of human morality. Our common duty is to respond decisively to the terrorist aggression.” President Tayyip Erdoğan has vowed not to rest in the fight against all forms of terrorism. In a written statement, he said: “As a nation, we will fight to the end against not just the armed attacks of terror groups and the forces behind them, but also against their economic, political and social attacks. They are trying to create chaos, demoralise our people, and destabilise our country with abominable attacks which target civilians ... We will retain our cool-headedness as a nation, standing more closely together, and we will never give ground to such dirty games.” There has been condemnation of the attack from around the world. This is from the UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, who has Turkish ancestry but has lampooned President Erdoğan in the past The foreign ministry of neighbouring Greece said: We unequivocally condemn the barbaric terrorist attack with numerous casualties that occurred in the nightclub in Istanbul. We express our full solidarity with the Turkish people and convey heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims and wishes of a speedy recovery to the injured. And this is from Israel, which has already said that an Israeli woman was injured in the attack and that another is missing. I am going to hand over the blog now to my colleague, Haroon Siddique. Many thanks to our readers and I hope the blog has proved useful. There are still many details yet to emerge about the motivation behind the attack, the whereabouts of the assailant(s) and of course the details of the victims. Below is a full report of where things stand at the moment. Mehmet Dag, 22, was passing by the club at the time of the shooting. He says he saw the suspect shoot at a police officer and a bystander outside, before going in. “I was in shock at the scene,” he said. “Once he went in, we don’t know what happened. There were gun sounds and after two minutes, the sound of an explosion.” Israel’s foreign ministry has said that an Israeli woman was injured in the attack, and that another is missing. “An Israeli woman was injured and hospitalised, but her life is not in danger, while there is no news of a second Israeli woman who was in the nightclub at the time of the attack,” a ministry spokesman told AFP. Turkey is a popular tourist destination for Israelis, with tens of thousands visiting each year. At least 39 people have been killed, and 69 injured, in an Istanbul nightclub after a gunman reportedly dressed as Father Christmas entered and began firing at random during a New Year’s Eve celebration. Interior minister Süleyman Soylu said that of 21 victims identified so far, 15 were foreign nationals. Soylu said the gunman was still on the run, contrary to earlier statements by authorities that the assailant had been killed. The city’s governor, Vasip Sahin, said the attacker, armed with a long-barrelled weapon, killed a policeman and a civilian outside the Reina club at about 1.45am before moving inside. Sahin described it as a “terror attack” but gave no further details. There have not yet been any claims of responsibility. It is thought up to 600 people were inside the club, an exclusive hotspot popular with tourists and local residents that sits on the bank of the eastern side of the Bosphorus. Witnesses reported a rush for the exits, bodies lying on the floor and people jumping into the water to escape the gunman. The club’s owner said extra security measures had been brought in in the past 10 days after US intelligence reports suggested a possible attack. Security has been increased across the city following the mass shooting in the district of Ortakoy. The US embassy has told its citizens to avoid the area and urged them to contact relatives to let them know they are safe. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has been quoted by state-run news agency Anadolu as expressing his “deep sadness”. Mehmet Görmez, Turkey’s most senior cleric, has condemned the attack as “savagery” and a “massacre that no Muslim conscience can accept”. Mehmet Görmez, Turkey’s most senior cleric, has condemned the attack as “savagery, horrendous”. “The action is a murder and a massacre,” he said. “Terror can never be accepted no matter by who or against whom it is committed.” The only nuance, which differentiates the terrorist action committed tonight from others, is that it aims to divide the nation and confront people from differnet lifestyles by inciting them. Today is the day to unite as the whole national against any kind of terror. I strongly condemn the terrorists who committed this massacre that no Muslim conscience can accept. I wish mercy from Allah for the ones who lost their lives in the attack and speedy recovery for the injured. Justice minister Bekir Bozdağ issued a statement earlier, saying: “No terrorist attack will break our unity.” Koçarslan also mentions that the attacker was using “Kalashnikovs”. This would support other witness accounts that the gunman was using multiple weapons. It is also the first detail that has emerged about the type of firearm used, other than Istanbul governor Vasip Sahin’s reference to the use of “a long-barrelled weapon”. Turkish newspaper Hürriyet has quoted Mehmet Koçarslan, the owner of the Reina nightclub where the attack took place, as saying security measures had been brought in over the past 10 days after US intelligence reports suggested a possible attack. A bit more background on Istanbul’s Reina club. The place is popular with Turkey’s young, secular elite and is one of the most prestigious nightspots in the city. It is situated on the shores of the Bosphorus on the European side of the city and has a terrace that goes down to the water’s edge. The most wealthy patrons arrive in boats to enjoy its several restaurants and dancefloors. Its parties are well known on the social circuit. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has issued his condolences. The US state department made in its response earlier a specific reference to Turkey as “our Nato ally” in the fight against terrorism. The health minister, Recep Akdağ, has also spoken, indicating four of the 69 injured are in a “very serious condition” and that the wounded also included several foreigners. Turkey’s interior minister has lowered the number of foreign nationals killed to 15. However, it is worth noting that there are still more than a dozen victims who have yet to be identified. AP quotes Süleyman Soylu as saying of the five Turkish fatalities identified so far, three or four were believed to be employees working at the club. He says: This was a massacre, a truly inhuman savagery. He said it was believed the attacker left the club wearing different clothing to those in which he entered the club. It has been reported the attacker was wearing a Father Christmas outfit. Soylu said the attacker was believed to have been acting alone. Previous witness reports have suggested there might have been more than one attacker. Authorities earlier said the gunman was killed on site, so details remain unclear, about eight hours after the attack took place. The UK’s Foreign Commonwealth Office and Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have said they are working to determine if any of their citizens are involved in Sunday morning’s attack. At least 39 people have been killed, and 69 injured, in an Istanbul nightclub after a gunman reportedly dressed as Father Christmas entered and began firing at random during a New Year’s Eve celebration. Interior minister Süleyman Soylu said that of 21 victims identified so far, 16 were foreign nationals. Soylu said the gunman was still on the run, contrary to earlier statements by authorities that the gunman had been killed. The city’s governor, Vasip Sahin, said the attacker, armed with a long-barrelled weapon, killed a policeman and a civilian outside the Reina club at about 1.45am before moving inside. Sahin described it as a “terror attack” but gave no further details. There have not yet been any claims of responsibility. It is thought up to 600 people were inside the club, an exclusive hotspot popular with tourists and local residents that sits on the bank of the eastern side of the Bosphorus. Witnesses reported a rush for the exits, bodies lying on the floor and people jumping into the water to escape the gunman. Security has been increased across the city following the attack in the district of Ortakoy. The US embassy has told its citizens to avoid the area and urged them to contact relatives to let them know they are safe. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has been quoted by state-run news agency Anadolu as expressing his “deep sadness” over the attack More quotes have come through from the interior minister, Süleyman Soylu: Our security forces have started the necessary operations. God willing he will be caught in a short period of time. Some images have come through giving a view from the Bosphorus on to the Reina nightclub, inside which security officers can be seen. Soylu gave the figure of 16 foreigners dead after only 21 victims were identified. This means the nationalities of 18 more victims are yet to be established. The interior minister, Süleyman Soylu, has said the attacker is still on the loose. Earlier government reports stated there was a lone gunman who was killed by police. Soylu said the death toll was now at 39, with 16 of those being foreign nationals. He did not provide any information on their countries. A further 69 people are being treated in hospitals across the city. Agence France-Presse is reporting comments from the interior minister, saying that the death toll has risen to 39, including 16 foreigners. Professional footballer Sefa Boydas has told AFP how people fainted after they heard gunshots while others walked on top of people to escape the attack. Boydas, who plays for Istanbul club Beylerbeyi SK, said he had only been in the club for about 10 minutes with two friends before he heard gunshots and his friend collapsed in shock. Just as we were settling down, by the door there was a lot of dust and smoke. Gunshots rang out. When those sounds were heard, many girls fainted. He said people appeared to be crushed as they ran away. They say 35 to 40 died but it’s probably more because when I was walking, people were walking on top of people.” He described the screams which he said drowned out anything said by the attacker or attackers. He uses the word “they”, which could support the notion that there was more than one assailant. Even if there were shouting, you wouldn’t hear because the crowd’s screams were 100 times louder.” Boydas initially tried to escape holding his friend but upon seeing her older sister faint, the footballer said his friend also passed out. Our Middle East reporter Kareem Shaheen has filed this report from Istanbul. He notes it is still unclear how many assailants were involved. While the authorities said one gunman entered the club and was later killed by police, witness testimony in Turkish media appeared to describe more than one attacker, heightening fears that at least one other gunman remained on the loose. At least 35 people have been killed, and about 40 injured, in an Istanbul nightclub after a gunman reportedly dressed as Santa Claus entered and began firing at random during a New Year’s Eve celebration The city’s governor, Vasip Sahin, said the attacker, armed with a long-barrelled weapon, killed a policeman and a civilian outside the Reina club at about 1.45am before moving inside. Sahin described it as a “terror attack” but gave no further details. There have not yet been any claims of responsibility. It is thought up to 600 people were inside the club, a hotspot popular with tourists and local residents that sits on the bank of the eastern side of the Bosphorus. Witnesses reported a rush for the exits, bodies lying on the floor and people jumping into the river to escape the gunman, who has been killed, according to a government spokesman. Security has been increased across the city following the attack in the district of Ortakoy. The US embassy has told its citizens to avoid the area and urged them to contact relatives to let them know they are safe. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has been quoted by state-run news agency Anadolu as expressing his “deep sadness” over the attack The US embassy in Turkey has urged US citizens to avoid the area – the district of Ortakoy – in the wake of the attack. It said in a statement: “We strongly urge US citizens in Turkey to directly contact concerned family members in the United States to advise them of your safety.” It is worth noting the club is popular with tourists as well as local residents. There is no word as yet on the nationalities of those who have been killed, or indeed an exact death toll. The BBC is reporting a media blackout has been ordered by the Turkish government for security reasons. Security measures had been heightened in major Turkish cities during what has been a year marked by terrorist attacks. In Istanbul, 17,000 police officers were on duty during this week’s festive celebrations. Some were camouflaged as Santa Claus and others as street vendors, state news agency Anadolu reported. The state-run Anadolu news agency has quoted the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, as expressing his “deep sadness” over the attack. He is getting regular updates on the investigation and the casualties from the prime minister, Binali Yıldırım. Kareem Shaheen is reporting a huge security presence in the districts surrounding Ortakoy, where the attack took place. Many roads have been closed off. The hugely popular Istiklal avenue – a pedestrianised area packed with shops, bars and cafes – is lined with many police cars and armed officers. The coast guard patrols the Bosphorus near the river frontage of the Reina nightclub. There were reports of partygoers jumping into the river to escape the gunman. Witness Sinem Uyanik has recounted her ordeal. She was inside the club and her husband, Lutfu Uyanik, was wounded in the attack. “Before I could understand what was happening, my husband fell on top me,” she said outside Istanbul’s Sisli hospital. “I had to lift several bodies from on top of me before I could get out.” Turkey has been hit by a string of attacks in recent months, blamed on Kurdish militants and Islamic State jihadists. On December 10, 44 people were killed in a double bombing in Istanbul after a football match hosted by top side Besiktas. That attack, which targeted a police bus, was claimed by the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons (TAK) seen as a radical offshoot of the PKK. A week later, 14 Turkish soldiers were killed and dozens more wounded in a suicide car bombing blamed on Kurdish militants targeting off-duty conscripts also claimed by the TAK. In June, 47 people were killed in a triple suicide bombing and gun attack at Istanbul’s Ataturk airport, with authorities blaming Isis. Another 57 people, 34 of them children, were killed in August in a suicide attack by an Isis-linked bomber at a Kurdish wedding in the southeastern city of Gaziantep. The US state department has strongly condemned the attack. Deputy spokesman Mark Toner said: “We stand in solidarity with our Nato ally Turkey in combating the ongoing threat of terrorism. Sadly, this heinous attack is only the latest effort to kill and maim innocent civilians. These attacks only reinforce our determination to work with the government of Turkey to counter the scourge of terrorism.” US president Barack Obama, who is on holiday Hawaii, has expressed his condolences and offered help to Turkish authorities. White House spokesman Eric Schultz said in a statement: “The president expressed condolences for the innocent lives lost, directed his team to offer appropriate assistance to the Turkish authorities, as necessary, and keep him updated as warranted.” Government officials have said there was one attacker and that he has been killed. Our reporter says police can be seen leaving the scene now, and emergency services activity is beginning to subside, which might suggest the immediate threat is over. Here is an image from 2015 of the Reina club, where the shooting took place. NTV television is reporting the assailant may still be inside the nightclub. This is an unconfirmed report. Armed police in riot gear, backed up by armoured vehicle, have sealed off the area. As many as 600 people were thought to have been in the club when the attack happened, at about 1.15am, broadcaster CNN Turk has reported. Some people jumped into the waters of the Bosphorus to escape and were being rescued by police. Istanbul’s governor, Vasip Sahin, told reporters at the scene: “A terrorist with a long-range weapon ... brutally and savagely carried out this incident by firing bullets on innocent people who were there solely to celebrate the New Year and have fun.” Kareem has spoken to a witness who was inside the club at the time. He described the rush for the exits after someone came in and began firing multiple firearms. A brother of one of the workers inside Reina is waiting outside in the rain with his wife for any news. His brother lost his phone and they have been unable so far to get in touch. We hope he is fine. My sister called me with the news that there was an attack and we put on our clothes and rushed here. It was really hard because no taxis wanted to go here. Police arrived almost instantaneously after the attack began because the police station is just across the road from the club. The Reina is one of Istanbul’s best-known clubs, situated on the Bosphorus right under one of the bridges linking the European and Asian sides. Footage has emerged that reportedly shows the assailant dressed as Santa. Details however are still far from clear. Earlier reports said there were two attackers. Witnesses are in the police station giving testimony at the moment so more details should soon emerge. It is just coming up to 4.30am in Istanbul. Our Middle East reporter, Kareem Shaheen, is at the scene of the attack. Police have sealed off the roads around the site as families arrive, seeking news of loved ones who were working at the club or visiting. There are a lot of tears. One woman rushed here because her nephew works as a bartender at the Reina club. She has finally just reached him on the phone. At least 35 people have been killed in a gun attack at a nightclub in Istanbul, the city’s governor has said. Vasip Sahin said 40 other people were wounded in the assault which took place in the early hours of Sunday during a New Year’s Eve celebration. Sahin said the incident was a “terror attack” without saying who might have carried it out. The assailant shot a police officer and a civilian as he entered the club in the Ortakoy district before opening fire inside the building, Sahin said. There are many details that are still unclear, we will bring your further details as they come to light.','https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2017/jan/01/istanbul-nightclub-attack-dozens-killed-new-years-eve-mass-shooting-live-updates','Istanbul attack: Manhunt for attacker who killed 39 in nightclub – as it happened',31);
