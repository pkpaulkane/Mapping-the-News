INSERT INTO `Articles` VALUES ('world/2017/jan/02/beautiful-and-doomed-new-zealands-capital-begins-the-fight-of-its-life','Ringed by golden beaches and temperate Pacific seas, Kaitaia is unconscionably pretty, dotted with flaming red pohutukawa trees and blessed by year-round blue skies. The town of 5,000 people on the northern tip of New Zealand’s North Island should be known as a holiday resort, but instead it has been dubbed the murder capital of New Zealand after four homicides and six suicides in a single year. “It is like the town has become haunted,” says Nina Griffiths, 18, who lost two friends to suicide this year. “People say you have to get out of Kaitaia, you have to get out of this shithole. There is a sense of hopelessness if you stay here ... we don’t feel like our lives are valued enough to put effort in to save them, and make sure this never happens again.” Kaitaia is the last major stop on state highway one in the far north; 300km from Auckland or a $150 plane ticket out. Half the town earn less than NZ$20,000 a year, and 60% are Maori, with unemployment at more than double the national average. While it is pretty, the town is also remote, poor and increasingly stigmatised as the place dreams go to die. “We are a community that feels doomed,” said He Korowai trust chief executive Ricky Houghton in October, still reeling from the suicide of his nephew, and four other young men aged under 25. “If these deaths happened anywhere else in New Zealand it would be front-page news - a crisis. But because it’s Kaitaia we’re forgotten, no one cares what happens to us. People think there is no future for the people here.” Senior leaders openly acknowledge that Kaitaia has a range of entrenched and long-standing social problems, including a lack of viable employment, isolation and strong gang and drug links. But they also say 2016’s glut of deaths may finally prove a turning point for their “forgotten” town – that the deaths have spurred a formerly broken community to unite and stick up for itself in a way they haven’t seen in decades. Earlier this year, Kaitaia fire chief Colin Kitchen considered quitting his job after attending two hangings and a stabbing homicide in a 24-hour-period. “Our town has been knocked for sure, we’re still in shock. When it happens once or twice, well sadly that is expected, but when it keeps happening you think ‘what the hell is going on here?’ I did feel at one point that I would have to walk away from it, that I’d had enough,” says Kitchen, who has been with the fire brigade for more than four decades. “But if we stepped away from it, who would look after our community, and what kind of message would that send, if the leaders desert? I think this year has been so bad it’s been a wake-up call, and I am finally starting to see things turn around. The town is getting stronger and regrouping.” By August six people killed by their own hand had passed through the Kaitaia morgue. With some of the strictest guidelines in the world for the media reporting on suicides, the slew of “sudden deaths” fuelled Kaitaia’s reputation as the murder capital of New Zealand, and rumours in town twisted and warped, with some hearing as many as 15 people had died. Griffiths was feeling sick to the guts. Traumatised by the futility of her friends’ lives so bluntly ended, but also frustrated by the community’s initial response – which she describes as muted and repressed, with people referring to the deaths as “passings” instead of suicides and murders. Griffiths felt Kaitaia – and young people especially – had two options: implode, or change, fast. “This town is so small everyone was affected by the deaths, literally everyone,” says Griffiths, who has received a NZ$10,000 AMP scholarship to set up a youth space in town, intended as a retreat for vulnerable kids. “People are always asking me when we go away for sports events and stuff – ‘oh so you’re from the murder capital.’ And that doesn’t help us feel better about ourselves, or our town. It makes us feel really embarrassed of where we live and this past year there has not been a lot of pride around here.” In July Griffiths contacted comedian and mental health advocate Mike King, begging him to travel north and facilitate a straight-up conversation about suicide in Kaitaia. Suicide professionals tried to dissuade her, as they had attempted to dissuade King when he visited in 2013, saying discussing the deaths in a public forum could inspire copycats or “stir up emotions”. But Griffiths ignored their warnings and went ahead with the meeting – attended by hundreds – all desperately seeking guidance from King on how to stem the flow of young lives. King and Griffiths say most of the suicide prevention teams in Kaitaia refused to attend. “I know for a fact that Nina got a lot of flak for organising the meetings, and told she was a silly little girl who didn’t know what she was doing,” says King. “But she was absolutely right, her approach is backed up by the latest research, that talking about suicide is what communities need to do. There are a lot of young people up there who feel like no one cares about them, and no one loves them, they feel hopeless. Until that is addressed and brought into the light, the stats will continue to rise.” Griffiths’s determination to face the deaths head-on may have inspired others to reject the mounting negativity surrounding their town, and since August a small but perceptible change has begun, with no more homicides or suicides recorded. The Facebook group ‘I love Kaitaia’ has hundreds of members, and bumper stickers and T-shirts with the slogan are worn proudly by the town’s residents. Musicians have written songs extolling the virtues of their Far North paradise, and trees have been strung with streamers; the once-weed strewn garden beds planted with red and pink geraniums. Formal and informal mentoring and guardian relationships are also tentatively being broached. In a coup for the town, last week the Warriors rugby league team flew in on the royal air force DC3 for a three-day visit, with the sole mission of lifting morale. “Being dubbed the murder capital made people really angry, and they wanted to fight back, because we love our home,” Griffiths says. “We don’t want to be defined by death.” In New Zealand, crisis helplines can be found here. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

Everyone is on board,” said the Russian embassy in Washington, quoted by the state-owned Ria Novosti agency. Relatives of the diplomats were also on board, making 96 in all. The expulsions were part of a package of sanctions ordered by President Barack Obama on Thursday. US intelligence says the Kremlin ordered a hack-and-release of emails from within the Democratic party and Hillary Clinton’s campaign in an effort to put Donald Trump in the Oval Office. Moscow has denied the allegations. Thirty-five Russians, described as intelligence operatives based at the Russian embassy in Washington and the consulate in San Francisco, were given 72 hours to leave the country. Obama also ordered the closure of two Russian compounds in New York and Maryland that the US says are used for intelligence-related purposes. Economic sanctions were also announced against Russia’s FSB and GRU intelligence agencies. President Vladimir Putin has ruled out sending home US diplomats in retaliation – a move interpreted as a sign that he is looking to Trump to rebuild US-Russian ties after his inauguration on 20 January. On Saturday, Donald Trump again expressed his scepticism over whether Russia was responsible for the computer hacks. In remarks to reporters upon entering a New Year’s Eve celebration at his Mar-a-Lago estate on Saturday night, Trump warned against being quick to pin the blame on Russia. “I just want them to be sure, because it’s a pretty serious charge,” he said. “And if you look at the weapons of mass destruction, that was a disaster, and they were wrong.” US intelligence officials have said that they are confident Russia was behind the US election hacks , which could have played a role in Trump’s defeat over Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The Washington Post also reported on Friday that Moscow could be behind malware found on a laptop owned by a Vermont electricity utility. In response to that discovery, Vermont governor Peter Shumlin said: “One of the world’s leading thugs, Vladimir Putin, has been attempting to hack our electric grid, which we rely upon to support our quality of life, economy, health, and safety.” At Mar-a-Lago, Trump said: “I think it’s unfair if we don’t know. It could be somebody else. I also know things that other people don’t know, so we cannot be sure.” Asked what that information included, the president-elect said: “You will find out on Tuesday or Wednesday.” He did not elaborate, although in a statement released on Thursday in response to Obama’s sanctions, he said he would meet intelligence officials.','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/01/russian-envoys-leave-us-hack-sanctions-putin-trump-cia','Russian envoys leave US after sanctions for alleged hacks',2,'world'),('sustainable-business/2017/jan/01/sustainable-technology-2016-climate-change-environment','It’s been a rollercoaster of a year. In the world of sustainability alone, we saw the landmark Paris climate change agreement come into force; learned how rising temperatures in the Arctic are negatively impacting local residents; and watched as the world’s top conservationists mourned the declining state of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef. And then, a bombshell: a certain “short-fingered vulgarian” won the US presidential race and called into question everything from America’s basic environmental protection to Nasa’s ongoing climate change research. Corporate America took evasive action, signing a letter telling Donald Trump it is serious about sustainability, while others began unpacking Trump’s emphasis on “clean coal” and what it really means for the future of energy in the US. But it hasn’t all been doom and gloom. While the rest of the world struggled to come to terms with the aforementioned craziness, innovators, scientists and tech heads worked quietly from the sidelines to come up with solutions. And some succeeded: from a trashcan that sucks up ocean garbage to a drone that delivers vaccines to endangered ferrets, here are our top picks for this year’s best sustainable tech. A trashcan for the ocean It’s no secret that our oceans are turning into swirling garbage dumps. There are some 5.25tn pieces of floating plastic debris in the oceans right now, and it’s estimated that some 8m metric tons of plastic waste enter global waters every year. Earlier this year, Peter Ceglinski and Andrew Turton, two surfers from Australia, came up with a device they’re calling the Seabin – a kind of submersible garbage can that captures floating trash. Picture a cylinder, with the upper opening just below the surface of the water. An electric pump draws water through the bottom of the cylinder, creating a vortex around the upper edge that pulls in water and floating trash. A bag filter, made of natural material, collects the trash and allows water to pass through. After raising more than $267,000 in an Indiegogo campaign to help build the device, Ceglinski and Turton are keen to start selling the Seabin to marinas around the world. First stop: Miami, Florida, where Miami Beach’s marinas manager wants to start using the Seabin in 2017 to counter the bags, bottles, paper plates and forks found daily in the water. A handheld cancer-detecting device Earlier this year, British-based tech firm QuantuMDx developed a new, low-cost diagnostic DNA analyzer the size of a smartphone which is being billed as a “handheld lab”. The device – called Q-Poc – can accurately diagnose everything from cancers to infectious diseases in minutes. Although it is currently in alpha testing stage, the company hopes to get the product in the hands of doctors by early 2018. Q-Poc runs on a solar-powered battery and it’s designed to read biological samples submitted via a credit card-size cartridge. It can work with a range of sample types: swabs can be used to detect sexually-transmitted infections, while saliva is used to detect tuberculosis. (Tests for other diseases will be added at a later date.) The device uses mobile technology, enabling the test results to be geo-stamped and shared in real time. The prospect of a speedy diagnosis at a patient’s side is exciting, particularly in countries where access to medical care is a challenge. Subject to regulatory approval by the World Health Organization (WHO), QuantuMDx hopes to initially roll out the Q-Poc unit in South Africa, before expanding to other markets. Stuff you can eat (instead of throwing it away) It was a big year for edible everyday items, like cutlery and beer cans. First up, an Indian cutlery company, Bakeys, invented cutlery that you can eat as a way to tackle plastic waste in oceans and landfill. (Welcome to a new geological epoch of trash – scientists are calling it the manmade Anthropocene.) Plastic cutlery significantly contributes to this problem – estimates suggest the US alone uses 40bn plastic utensils a year. Hence the need for edible versions. Bakeys makes vegan-friendly cutlery from rice, wheat and an ancient grain called sorghum, which was picked because it doesn’t go soggy when immersed in liquid. The cutlery comes in three flavors: savory (salt and cumin); sweet (sugar); and plain. And, if you’re wondering – it kind of tastes like a dry cracker. Why not wash down the cutlery with an edible beer holder? Americans are consuming more beer it seems – 67bn beer cans each year, apparently. According to the Brewers Association, this number is expected to grow significantly as craft breweries get more popular. The problem is that plastic beer can holders pose a threat to fish and marine wildlife when they end up in the ocean. Saltwater Brewery, based in Florida, has come up with a solution: biodegradable, edible beer pack rings made from wheat and barley waste. The rings disintegrate within two hours of being in the ocean, which prevents fish or other sea animals getting stuck. They’re also harmless if ingested by curious fish. More than 50 craft breweries have already contacted Saltwater expressing an interest in using the edible rings. The brewery is now developing metal molds capable of making 400,000 rings per month and hopes to build a centralized production facility by 2017. A drone that helps endangered species One of 2016’s most heartwarming stories revolved around a cunning plan by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) to bombard a ferret habitat in Montana with a vaccine administered via specially designed drones that can “shoot” pellets in three directions at the same time. All this in a bid to save the endangered black-footed ferret. The vaccine pellets are actually intended for the prairie dog population inside the habitat at the UL Bend National Wildlife Refuge. The ferrets are dependent upon prairie dogs for food and shelter, but a flea-borne disease called sylvatic plague has slowly been killing the prairie dogs off. The FWS came up with a “glorified gumball machine” to spit out the vaccine pellets. The machine which can be attached to a drone which uses GPS to drop the pellets throughout the habitat. Oh, and if you’re wondering: the FWS said lab tests show that prairie dogs find the bait in the vaccines “delicious”. Using 3D printers to eliminate plastic waste As we’ve established, humans produce a lot of trash – apparently of the more than 300m tons of plastic produced globally every year, one refuse truck’s worth ends up in our waters, landfills and streets every minute. One of our favorite stories this year came from India, where a local entrepreneur has set up a production facility at a local rubbish dump, where waste pickers convert high-density polyethylene (HPDE) – mostly used for plastic bottles – into 3D printing filament to eventually be sold to 3D printing companies. The market for 3D printing filament – the majority of which is made from virgin plastic – is growing rapidly. A recent report predicted the 3D printing materials market will grow by nearly 266% in the next five years. And, while the market for ethical filament is still relatively small, the greatest potential 3D printing seems to be offering the developing world is employment – there are an estimated 15 million people globally who currently make their living from waste picking, for example.','https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jan/01/sustainable-technology-2016-climate-change-environment','The five innovations that shaped sustainability in 2016',3,'sustainable-business'),('football/2017/jan/01/sam-allardyce-football-crystal-palace-manager-premier-league-fixture-sacked-arsenal','Sam Allardyce, after winning one point from his first two games in charge of Crystal Palace, has called for the Premier League fixture organiser to be “sacked”. The former England manager, who left his position with the national team after only one match following an undercover newspaper investigation, is now pointing the finger at fixture congestion. Yohan Cabaye, Christian Benteke and Andros Townsend were all substituted by Allardyce with Palace losing 2-0 at Arsenal on Sunday afternoon as the manager began to turn his attention to Tuesday’s home game with the bottom side Swansea City. “We’ve been dealt the blow of not having enough recovery time between now and Tuesday night, why can’t we play Wednesday?” asked Allardyce. “I don’t know who does the fixtures but he needs sacking really. “Swansea played yesterday, have 24 hours on us. They’re such big games with so much at stake, you want a fair crack at it, and it’s unfair when you’re playing [Sunday] and Tuesday night. I was disappointed in our first-half performance [against Arsenal]. “We gave much too good possession away. None more so than the [Giroud] goal. That was simple possession given away on one of our attacks in the first half. It was a brilliant piece of skill, how he took the goal, but our passing wasn’t good enough.” Allardyce is now looking to the transfer window to help out his Palace squad. “Two things [need] to happen for the team to get better and produce more results: get the team fitter and buy players in. Two if possible, three if the finances will allow,” he said. “I want to lift the squad. It lifted the whole place last year at Sunderland.”','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/01/sam-allardyce-football-crystal-palace-manager-premier-league-fixture-sacked-arsenal','Sam Allardyce says Premier League fixture organiser should be sacked',4,'football'),('football/blog/2017/jan/01/pressure-grows-on-pep-guardiola-manchester-city-toil','Pep Guardiola wished the assembled media a happy new year at the start of his post-match press conference and extended the seasonal goodwill message to their families when he left the Anfield stage. It was a nice touch by the Manchester City manager but the niceties were part of a performance better than that produced by his team at Liverpool and exposed by an angry, exasperated exchange with Txiki Begiristain shortly afterwards. There was no goodwill to be found in defeat by Jürgen Klopp and falling 10 points adrift of Chelsea, the leaders. Press duties completed, Guardiola headed back to the makeshift dressing rooms in the bowels of Anfield’s new main stand where he met Begiristain, City’s director of football and a man with some serious questions to answer over the club’s expensive and erratic recruitment drive. Guardiola, pacing up and down, scratched his head, pulled at his tie and began punching his fist into the palm of his hand as he dissected City’s display with his former Barcelona colleague. They have trailed and recovered before but that was at a club attuned to Guardiola’s methods and vice-versa. A revealing glimpse into genuine frustration and the performance that provoked it were reminders of how much work is required to recreate that understanding at the Etihad Stadium. “The manager was angry at half‑time,” Yaya Touré admitted. “When you are losing like that and Liverpool are the better side then it’s not going to be happy at half-time. It was disappointing and we all felt that. Of course he is going to be angry. He is a manager who can be angry. We have to sometimes improve and react to situations, and of course we knew Liverpool would be waiting when we lost the ball and they did that to score. So he will be angry for everything that is happening. “We are not going to be perfect. There are times when we won’t take opportunities but we can take opportunities from this too. Anfield is not easy but we can learn from this and what the manager says about it. When you lose games, what do you have to do? You are disappointed and you want to bounce back. We don’t want to let the gap grow much more between us and Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham. So we have to react. We will use it – we are not going to give up. We will go to the&nbsp;end.” Touré and co responded to their manager’s criticism, controlling possession in the second half and forcing Liverpool into a retreat when David Silva switched to the centre in place of the subdued Kevin De Bruyne, but not to the extent of creating one chance of note. Klopp’s team were restricted as an attacking threat, too, but having punished City’s weakness in the air early, when Georginio Wijnaldum produced an outstanding leap and header to convert Adam Lallana’s eighth-minute cross, their compact shape held firm. The Liverpool manager had bemoaned the freedom with which Joe Allen roamed between his midfield and defence in their previous outing, against Stoke City. He ensured there was no repeat against Manchester City with a more protective midfield trio of Wijnaldum, Jordan Henderson and Emre Can. Raheem Sterling, fading amid the hostility that greeted his latest return to Anfield, De Bruyne, Silva, in the first half, and Sergio Agüero, throughout his first appearance in 28 days, were comprehensively shackled. Klopp had the answers to City’s array of individual talents. His team have collected 13 points from 18 while Philippe Coutinho has been injured and, as the Brazilian nears fitness, so Liverpool have emerged as formidable challengers to Chelsea. Klopp said it must be annoying for Antonio Conte’s team to have won 13 consecutive league games and still found Liverpool hanging on six points behind. Equally, how annoying must it be to have won 12 of the last 16 league games and sit second? “We came from eighth position last year so we don’t think about being champion or whatever this year, but we are much better than last year and the position is completely different,” said Klopp. “We are fine. If anyone else thought we had to be champion this year then maybe it seems different to them but we are fine. We are where we are and if it ends there then cool. “If we are still there five matches before the end and are only a few points behind then we will think about something else but not in this moment. I’m not like this. I have had much more difficult situations in my life than being second in a very difficult league. We are happy about our way and what the rest is doing we can have no influence on until we play them. That’s all we can do. I’m not annoyed. Not for one second. “I won a league twice and I honestly didn’t think about the opportunity until really late. We have targets. We are ambitious. You saw it again against City how ambitious the boys are but talking about it doesn’t bring you one point. You have to work. When you see the final line and if you are still in and around then the pressure will increase. You could see the pressure here – not because we didn’t want to lose the game but because we wanted to win it. That is really pressure against a very good side. You do the analysis and think: ‘Oh my God, I don’t want to show the boys all of this because they are a really good side.’ I know there is criticism of their defending or whatever but they play some of the best football in the world and you have to defend it. We did it. I’m happy with our situation in the table at the moment.” Klopp can be content not only with Liverpool’s league position but how his team have developed rapidly according to his managerial ideals. Guardiola, between the new year wishes, admitted he is unsure when City will do likewise. “I don’t know, I’m not able to tell you that,” he said. “Jürgen is here more than one season, more than one year. I’ve been here just six months and the way we want to play in the league is not that simple. We need a little bit more time but I’m a guy who is so optimistic and we’re going to try.”','https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/jan/01/pressure-grows-on-pep-guardiola-manchester-city-toil','Pep Guardiola feels pressure as tempers fray and Manchester City toil | Andy Hunter',5,'football'),('football/2017/jan/01/manchester-united-zlatan-ibrahimovic-critics-eat-their-balls-middlebrough-football','Zlatan Ibrahimovic believes his 17 goals for Manchester United have made his doubters “eat their balls” and that José Mourinho’s side can still win the title. Saturday’s 2-1 victory against Middlesbrough at Old Trafford was a fifth straight league win and takes United to 36 points, 13 behind the leaders, Chelsea, as they travel to West Ham United for Monday’s late afternoon kick-off. United needed goals from Anthony Martial and Paul Pogba on 85 and 86 minutes to overcome Grant Leadbitter’s strike with a quarter of the game to go but the home side felt they should have been ahead before half-time. Ibrahimovich had what appeared a legitimate finish struck off by the referee, Lee Mason, for his collision with Víctor Valdés despite this clearly occurring after the No9 made contact with the ball. The finish would have taken the Swede to 51 goals in 2016, level with Lionel Messi’s highest mark for the calendar year. Yet Ibrahimovic was content with the three points and in his own particular fashion took personal satisfaction from the stellar start to his United career after his summer move from Paris Saint-Germain. “I had a fantastic year, I am not complaining. I came to United, my first six months here has been more than amazing. I am super happy and let’s hope we can continue the ride and keep going. I feel good. I don’t know how many years I have left but I am enjoying the football. I came to the Premier League and everyone thought it would not be possible but like always I make them eat their balls.” Asked to explain this, the 35-year-old said: “It gives me a lot of energy, trust me. A lot of energy because they get paid to talk shit and I get paid to play with my feet, that’s how I enjoy it.” United are trying for a sixth consecutive league victory for the first time in two seasons. Ibrahimovich said of their form: “With every game you win, you get confidence. We haven’t lost for the last 10 games [actually 12], and it was important to win against Middlesbrough. We had to work hard for the win and the important thing is the three points because we want to come closer to the top and we are losing 1-0 and we should have had the goal, I scored. “Why he whistled, I don’t know. At first he gave the goal and after 30 seconds, he changed his mind. There was not a lot to speak to him because if you open your mouth, they give you a yellow and I was like: ‘Listen, you just took a goal from me, and now you want to give me a yellow card.’ OK, we keep playing and conceded a goal, it was easy for them and after we were working and then it was 1-1, and 2-1 within a minute. “That was not important – to level with Messi. The important thing was to win. For me the win is the same if I would beat Messi or not. Hopefully we can still win the league. We had our dips and we were winning and losing and winning and losing and hopefully the other teams can do some mistakes and we can close the gap closer and come into the top four.” Ibrahimovic has never played two matches in 48 hours, as he will do when lining up at West Ham, with Mourinho confirming he will start there. “It’s crazy,” said the centre-forward. “There is no superman, there is no strength that can recover from a game so fast and I cannot do nothing about it. If the coach wants me to play, I will play. But let’s be realistic, from a game you need to recover two or three days.” A happy Mourinho said: “Zlatan’s disappointed because in this moment he should be celebrating being top scorer in 2016. He did it. But he will start on Monday. You can tell [Slaven] Bilic that.” West Ham are 12th with 22 points after Saturday’s 1-0 defeat at Leicester City, who visit a Middlesbrough side four points above the drop zone on Monday. Leadbitter said: “We have a little league table that we want to finish top of, and that has to be our priority this season. One of the teams in that league is coming up on Monday at home and we have to look forward.”','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/01/manchester-united-zlatan-ibrahimovic-critics-eat-their-balls-middlebrough-football','Manchester United’s Ibrahimovic says he has made critics ‘eat their balls’',6,'football'),('football/2017/jan/01/diego-costa-antonio-conte-chelsea-premier-league','Shortly after the final whistle blew at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, Antonio Conte and Diego Costa could be seen walking back towards the tunnel together. Manager appeared to be sharing a joke with player, one he declined to expand on later, but their body language said it all. Smiles, a warm embrace, mutual bonhomie, and with regard to Costa the concrete sense that he is entering 2017 in a far happier mood than he did 2016. This time last year the forward was in the midst of a personal crisis, having scored just six times for a Chelsea side making a mockery of their status as league champions, and was spending more time picking fights with opposition players than terrorising them with his talents. Now he is the key figure of the team that sit six points clear at the top of the Premier League on the back of a record‑equalling 13-game winning run. Costa has 14 goals, making him the division’s top scorer, with his latest against Stoke City typifying the 28‑year‑old at his barnstorming, ruthless best, the man who spearheaded Chelsea’s title success of 2014-15 and appears ready to do so again. “The team has changed, not just me,” he said. “Last season we felt a frustration. We didn’t give the account of ourselves we should have done. We weren’t the team we should be. I wasn’t the player I should be. There were various issues but this season it has changed. The manager has come and applied his ideas. Things are going well.” Of that there is no doubt. Conte has revitalised Chelsea, tactically and in terms of their spirit, which could be seen at the weekend in what the Italian described as the toughest challenge his team have faced during their winning sequence. Stoke played with aggression and assurance and twice pegged back the hosts. But those in blue kept on believing, kept on driving forward, and eventually triumphed 4-2. It was fitting that Costa sealed the three points with the fourth goal, having delivered another fine front-man display. He was a constant menace and did not react to the rugged manner in which those in the visitors’ ranks, Ryan Shawcross in particular, looked to keep him at bay. Last season Costa would have lashed out – or accused Shawcross of smelling rotten, as he did when the pair clashed at the Britannia Stadium 14 months ago – but here he kept his calm, something he says is the result of accepting referees in this country are “against me” and: “If they’re not going to change, I had to change.” Eyebrows may well be raised at that statement and it’s worth noting that for all his “changes”, Costa has already served a one-match suspension this season. But he definitely seems calmer and he delivered the perfect response to Stoke’s attentions with a vicious strike past Lee Grant on 85 minutes having floored Bruno Martins Indi with brute strength and persistence. Costa has now been involved in 19 goals this season – more than any other player across Europe’s top five divisions. “Things are coming out well for me this season,” he said. “The truth is that the manager is good with the players, every time making jokes and that’s good for us, to have a manager who is not just a boss but a person we can talk to, someone whose support we can count on. We love him more all the time.” That love is clearly mutual – Conte describes Costa as an “important player”, and Chelsea fans may well shudder upon being reminded that the pair came close to not working together at Stamford Bridge. “Yes, yes, I was about to leave [in the summer],” said Costa. “I had the possibility of going back to Atlético [Madrid] because of a few things; the family, the life I have there. I wanted to change for family reasons but, well, it wasn’t to be and I continue to be happy here. “It was important that the manager from the very first minute said he counted on me.” Costa’s importance to Chelsea can be further seen in the fact his 14 league goals have come in 13 games. He has failed to score in only seven appearances in all competitions, and in only three of those did he complete 90 minutes. When Costa has played this season, he has tended to score. It should come as no surprise, then, that he is the latest figure to be linked with a move to China, with reports on Sunday claiming that Tianjin Quanjian are planning to make an £80m bid for the Brazil-born Spain international. Despite the size of the fee, it seems inconceivable Chelsea would sanction the move, and for Costa there must surely be the desire to see out a campaign in which he is on course to secure another Premier League winner’s medal and be named player of the year. As he said himself: “I am very happy, very content.” Chelsea’s collective focus now turns to visiting Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday and making history: no English club has won 14 successive top-flight games during a single campaign. Conte described the match as “the biggest challenge” Chelsea have faced since the first of their 13 victories – at Hull on 1 October – while from Costa came the insistence that the leaders are fully aware of what awaits them at White Hart Lane, a venue where they have not won since 2012. “It’s a London derby so the match is played a bit stronger,” he said. “But that’s no problem. We go there looking to do the best we can.”','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/01/diego-costa-antonio-conte-chelsea-premier-league','Diego Costa’s loving feeling keeps him firing for in-form Chelsea',7,'football'),('football/2017/jan/01/stoke-city-jack-butland-miss-rest-season-ankle-injury','Mark Hughes has revealed that the Stoke City goalkeeper Jack Butland could miss the rest of the season due to the injury he sustained while playing for England 10 months ago. Butland fractured his right ankle close to half-time of the 3-2 victory over Germany in Berlin on 26 March. The player left on a stretcher and was forced to miss the European Championship in France. He was, however, expected to return for Stoke’s first Premier League match of the season, at Middlesbrough, but aggravated the ankle just 24 hours before that game and has suffered a number of setbacks to his recovery since. A further operation last month was intended to mean a return to action in March, but Hughes, speaking after Stoke’s 4-2 defeat at Chelsea on Saturday, and in the context of tieing up a long-term deal for loanee goalkeeper Lee Grant, said the 23-year-old may not play again during the current campaign. “That’s a priority for us because we’re in a little bit of a situation with Jack Butland being unavailable for any number of months and he might not come back this season,” said Hughes. “He may well get back April/May time, we’re not sure. But we’re more comfortable with his situation now and understand what the problems have been. So he’ll be fine when he gets back.” Butland was in excellent form for Stoke before his injury and was deemed a certain member of Roy Hodgson’s squad for Euro 2016. Sam Allardyce was also known to view Butland as a serious contender to Joe Hart as England’s No1 during his brief spell in charge of the national team. Having managed Butland while in charge of England Under-21s, Gareth Southgate may well be keen to involve him at senior level, and would have potentially been able to do so for the friendly away to Germany on 22 March and World Cup qualifier at home to Lithuania four days later. However, the earliest Southgate might be able to select Butland is likely to be for the qualifier against Scotland at Hampden Park on 10 June. In Butland’s absence, Grant, 33, has impressed following his arrival from Derby County at the end of August. He made another string of eye-catching saves at Stamford Bridge and is expected shortly to turn his loan deal into a transfer, thought to be in the region of £1.5m. Derby had originally wanted closer to £4m for the player. “We lost Jack the Friday before the first game of the season so had to move quickly,” said Hughes. “Thankfully our goalkeeping coach Andy Quy had worked with Lee at Derby, so he knew him. It was still a risk. He’d had 300-odd games at a good level but had never played in the Premier League. But credit to him, he’s proven he’s a Premier League keeper.”','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/01/stoke-city-jack-butland-miss-rest-season-ankle-injury','Stoke’s Jack Butland could miss rest of season with ankle injury',8,'football'),('football/2017/jan/01/georginio-wijnaldum-urges-liverpool-step-up-pressure-on-chelsea','Georginio Wijnaldum has said it is essential Liverpool follow victory over Manchester City with another three points at Sunderland on Monday to increase the pressure on Premier League leaders Chelsea. Liverpool are the closest challengers to Antonio Conte’s side having moved four points ahead of City with a hard-fought win at Anfield on New Year’s Eve. Jürgen Klopp’s team, who remain six points behind the leaders, kick off at struggling Sunderland less than 44 hours after the conclusion of the City match and may be without their captain, Jordan Henderson, as well as the confirmed absentees Philippe Coutinho and Joël Matip. Henderson was withdrawn with a heel injury against Pep Guardiola’s team, although it is not the same heel that sidelined the midfielder for sustained spells last season. Chelsea do not play until Wednesday’s awkward assignment at Tottenham Hotspur and Wijnaldum, who secured Liverpool’s win over City with an outstanding header, believes Sunderland is an opportunity for Klopp’s team to pressure the leaders by cutting the gap to three points. The Holland international said: “You always have to put pressure on an opponent. We just have to win the game. Will it put pressure on them? I don’t know, maybe. Sunderland is a tough game as they also want to win because of the threat of relegation. Chelsea are flying right now and doing great but we have to focus on our own game and we will see if we come closer but the main thing is to keep doing what we are doing now, win our own games and not look at Chelsea because we don’t control that performance. “We have to give 100% and show how good we are. We can go far but we have to show it game by game. It is going well now but we don’t know how it will be going in two months so we must make sure we go all the time.” Klopp said it must be “annoying” for Chelsea to have won 13 league games in succession and find Liverpool still on their coat-tails, and Wijnaldum credited the manager for instilling in his players the belief to beat Guardiola’s expensively assembled side. “He just gives us confidence. In my opinion he does not do a lot special, just gives us the confidence we need, the confidence in our own quality and that we are a good team,” the midfielder explained. “He spoke in the team meeting and said, ‘We have to show our quality and show them how good you are.’ “I was not here before Klopp came so I can’t give my opinion on how the football has changed but in my opinion it is great to work under the manager. He gives players a happy feeling to play for Liverpool. What he wants is that we have joy in the things we do – training, games – and that is important for a footballer.” Wijnaldum also claimed Quincy Promes, his international team-mate, would succeed at Liverpool should Klopp develop his interest in the Spartak Moscow midfielder this month. “I think he knows how great Liverpool is, I knew it before I came here,” said the summer recruit from Newcastle United. “I don’t know if everything is true about what they say as I don’t speak with him about that. Of course I want him to come to Liverpool because I know he is a good player and also a good person who can help the team but it is something for the manager and the scouts, not for me.”','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/01/georginio-wijnaldum-urges-liverpool-step-up-pressure-on-chelsea','Georginio Wijnaldum urges Liverpool to step up pressure on Chelsea',9,'football'),('sport/2017/jan/01/gary-anderson-peter-wright-pdc-world-darts-championship','Gary Anderson is one game from true greatness. Only Phil Taylor and Eric Bristow have won three consecutive world championships, but Anderson has the chance to join that club after an ultimately comfortable 6-3 win over Peter Wright in the semi-final. It was his 17th victory in a row at Alexandra Palace, and he has the aura to match. For so long Anderson was the underachieving genius of darts. He won his first world title two years ago at the age of 44, beating Phil Taylor 7-6 in a classic final, and followed up by retaining his title with formidable authority a year ago. Once he struggled under extreme pressure; now he is a big-game specialist, who saves his best darts for the biggest tournament of all. Anderson was never behind in a contest that was both high-class and nervy: the scoring was relentless, with 25 180s, yet both players were unusually fragile on doubles. Wright came back from 3-1 to 3-3 before Anderson ran away with the match by taking the final eight legs. There was not much between the two but the timing of Anderson’s big scores and big finishes – particularly a 157 to stop Wright’s fightback and go 4-3 up – was decisive. “I’m very proud of winning the world championship twice,” said Anderson. “This year I just wanted to get past the first round and see what happens. The crowd have been amazing. I feel comfortable up here, for some strange reason. I knew I was scoring well – the 180s are back – and although I missed a few doubles I was glad to get over the line. I don’t want to give the title up.” In the previous two rounds Anderson survived ferocious assaults from Benito van de Pas of the Netherlands and Dave Chisnall from St Helens. It was expected that he would get an even greater test from Wright, the world No3 who was playing beautifully. It is a reflection of the monstrous standard of modern darts that although Anderson and Wright averaged 103.45 and 99.83 respectively, it felt like the two Scotsmen were not at their best. Wright had taken out 53% of his doubles in the tournament; against Anderson that figure dropped to 30. It was an insurmountable malfunction. He started the match with a 180 only to miss six darts at the double to win the first leg. It set the tone for a traumatic start. By the time Wright hit a double at the 11th attempt, Anderson was well on the way to a 2-0 lead. Wright had darts to win four of the first five legs but lost the lot; and when he dragged the second set back to 2-2, Anderson threw six perfect darts to extinguish any hope. When the fourth set also went to a decider on the Anderson throw, he hit consecutive 180s once again. At that stage he seemed in complete control, only for Wright to drag the match back to 3-3 with a break in the sixth set. Anderson missed two darts to win both the fifth and sixth sets. He did not make the same mistake in the seventh. With Wright waiting on 70 – and with the darts should the set go to a fifth leg – Anderson took out a devastating 157. It was a hold of throw but a break of Wright’s spirit. He did not win another leg as Anderson stormed through the last two sets. “I’ve got no excuse, I didn’t play well enough,” said Wright. “I didn’t feel comfortable on the stage. My first dart wasn’t going in the treble 20, and that makes it really difficult. I really struggled to get the pitch of my darts right. And then when he gave me chances at doubles, I missed them as well. I’ve only been playing with these darts since mid-November so I’ll get better. Once I win a major I’ll win a few. Gary took care of me tonight and beat me up, and I hope he wins his third world title.”','https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/01/gary-anderson-peter-wright-pdc-world-darts-championship','Gary Anderson sees off Peter Wright to stay on track for PDC World Darts treble',10,'sport'),('australia-news/2017/jan/02/tony-abbott-australia-suspend-aid-palestinian-authority','Tony Abbott wants Australia to suspend aid to the Palestinian Authority because “it keeps paying pensions to terrorists and their families”. The former prime minister made the call in an opinion piece published in the Spectator Magazine on Monday. Australia gives more than $40m a year in aid to Palestine, provided through United Nations agencies and some charitable organisations. The money goes towards projects to provide Palestinian refugees with basic services such as health, education, water and sanitation. Last year, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade suspended aid to World Vision’s work in the Palestinian territories in the wake of allegations the charity’s head in Gaza funnelled millions of dollars to militant group Hamas. The organisation has denied the claims, which are subject to court proceedings in Israel. Abbott also said Australia could demonstrate “unswerving support for Israel” by joining any move by the incoming Trump administration to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Most governments have kept their embassy out of Jerusalem because they do not recognise Israel’s occupation of east Jerusalem since 1967. Noting that Israel’s GDP per person was about $40,000 a year, compared with Palestine’s of about $2,000, Abbott blamed the economic problems of the territories on “a focus on politics over economics and the all-pervading sense of grievance” among Palestinians. Last week the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, strongly indicated that Australia would not have supported a UN resolution – co-sponsored by New Zealand – criticising Israel’s settlements policy in the West Bank and east Jerusalem. The Israeli government reacted furiously when the US abstained on the resolution. The acting opposition leader, Chris Bowen, said Australian assistance to Gaza and the West Bank was vital to counter extremism and promote peace in the Middle East. “Mr Abbott is clearly using this as yet another issue to undermine Malcolm Turnbull and continue his campaign to regain the leadership by appealing to the hardliners in the Liberal party,” Bowen said. Australia’s aid program must be transparent and accountable and must reach those it was intended to benefit, he said. Abbott recently returned from a trip to the Middle East, including Israel. He attended the Australia-Israel-UK Dialogue in Jerusalem with opposition leader Bill Shorten and other federal MPs. In his article Abbott also noted that at the dialogue Professor Nir Shaviv of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem “methodically debunked the climate change theories peddled by the UN Panel”. If he was right, Abbott wrote, “countries like ours have been inflicting pointless economic pain upon themselves’.','https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jan/02/tony-abbott-australia-suspend-aid-palestinian-authority','Tony Abbott says Australia should suspend aid to Palestinian Authority',11,'australia-news'),('tv-and-radio/2017/jan/01/sherlock-benedict-cumberbatch-review-james-bond-margaret-thatcher-mark-gatiss-steven-moffat-detective','Spoiler alert: this review contains spoilers to the Sherlock episode The Six Thatchers, which aired on 1 January 2017. It may have been discussed in advance for featuring the destruction of one strong Englishwoman – the plot involves the smashing of six statues of Margaret Thatcher – but the New Year’s Day episode of Sherlock will make headlines after transmission for the annihilation of another. Mary Watson, the wife of Holmes’s sidekick, shockingly became – following Matthew Crawley in Downton Abbey and Nigel Pargetter in The Archers – the latest fictional character sacrificed over the festive period. Sherlock co-creators Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss also work on Doctor Who, which was awarded the other prime seasonal slot on the BBC on Christmas Day. But although the franchises have to some extent overlapped, both tending towards tragicomic love stories, viewers knew that as Amanda Abbington lay slain on the floor she would not shimmeringly regenerate into another actor. The Arthur Conan Doyle story on which Gatiss based his script has busts of Napoleon being smashed by an intruder. Here, the French emperor’s replacement with the former British prime minister has led to some muttering about the BBC’s supposed leftwing bias. But the point, as Sherlock immediately realises, is that the vandal has no political motivation: he’s looking for something hidden inside a head. In one respect, Gatiss has even depoliticised the original, which is filled with references to immigrants and refugees, “the outcasts of Europe”. A new sub-plot involving the historical decisions of a villainous woman in Whitehall also logically seemed to lead to Thatcher, but the script again opted to give the BBC press office a quiet holiday. The bulk of the rewrite, though, stayed scrupulously close to the source. In The Adventure of the Six Napoleons, Watson notes Holmes “being more nearly moved by the softer human emotions than I had ever seen him”. And Benedict Cumberbatch, in The Six Thatchers, is duly allowed far beyond his usual constricted emotional range. In the middle of the last decade, two veteran fantasy brands – Doctor Who and James Bond – simultaneously hit on the idea of casting classical actors (Christopher Eccleston and Daniel Craig) who could play a Time Lord or a spy with the intensity of Hamlet. Continuing the trend, Cumberbatch stalks Baker Street like a Danish prince with a decisive streak. But this time, as if blurring with Craig, he became a sort of 00221B. The episode felt very Bond overall – Holmes has never done so much running towards or away from explosions. And thanks to the dramatic impact achieved by director Rachel Talalay, the murder of Mary matched the death of M in Skyfall. Confronted with a dead friend, her widower and their motherless baby, Cumberbatch’s face (mainly required to remain blank) painted a picture of pain and confusion. And with Mary taking a bullet meant for Sherlock, Martin Freeman’s Watson let out an extended, escalating, animalistic moan. It’s unclear how Gatiss specified the sound in the script but, for King Lear, it was written as the hardest line in theatre: “Howl, howl, howl, howl!” During a Q&amp;A session after a premiere screening on 19 December, Freeman and Abbington discussed the weirdness of a real-life couple acting the tragic end of a relationship. But soon afterwards, it emerged that the context was uncanny: the actors had actually separated shortly before filming. Moffat and Gatiss told the same press conference that they were unsure if the remaining cast could be united for future series. Ominously, the last episode in this run, which airs on 15 January, is called The Final Problem – the name of the Conan Doyle story in which Holmes dies. Sherlock detectives will deduce a possible significance from this being the only one of the 13 episodes to use an original title without any alteration. But even if the worst were to happen, fans of this super-intelligent and hyper-entertaining show – which reached new heights of action and emotion in The Six Thatchers – will note that Conan Doyle, after his Final Problem, had to bring the character back by popular demand.','https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/01/sherlock-benedict-cumberbatch-review-james-bond-margaret-thatcher-mark-gatiss-steven-moffat-detective','Sherlock review – Cumberbatch channels Bond in the most explosive outing yet',12,'tv-and-radio'),('football/blog/2017/jan/01/love-hate-january-transfer-window','And so it begins … again. A rolling, meandering soap opera that never really stops started in earnest on Sunday as the new year heralded the opening of the January transfer window. An often tedious month-long orgy of will-they won’t-they drama, whisper and counter-whisper, unhappy Arsenal fans and sightings of Robert Snodgrass, it slowly builds to a climactic all-singing, all-dancing Sky Sports show-stopper hosted by an enthusiastic Scotsman who wears a yellow tie. We have been here before, many times. Fourteen, to be precise. Made compulsory by Fifa for the 2002-03 season, the January transfer window is one of two registration periods in which Premier League clubs are permitted to buy players they may or may not have been linked with by assorted TV and radio shows, newspaper gossip columns, football websites and social media accounts run by teenage schoolboys from football hotbeds such as Ludlow and Stow-on-the-Wold. Originally introduced as part of a compromise with the European Commission in order to preserve contractual stability for footballers and clubs while simultaneously allowing movement of the former at certain times of the year, the January window has since eclipsed the League Cup to become the third biggest competition in English football. The inaugural window was “won” by Birmingham City, who signed the World Cup and European Championship-winning striker Christophe Dugarry on loan from Bordeaux and ensured their Premier League survival with the help of four goals from the Frenchman in their final five matches of that season. And two years ago Crystal Palace came up trumps by paying just £6.8m to Manchester United to re-sign Wilfried Zaha, a fine, if occasionally gravitationally challenged, winger who recently made headlines after becoming embroiled in a disagreement with a man dressed as a giant hornet. When first mooted by Fifa in the early 1990s, the idea of introducing transfer windows received almost unanimous backing from English football’s overlords, who – rather naively, it turned out – hoped they might help reduce the often disruptive influence of nefarious agents around football clubs. In May 2002, however, the Premier League and Football League joined forces to fight against the imposition of domestic transfer windows due to the financial implications they might have in the wake of that year’s ITV Digital fiasco. “We have charged the FA with responsibility to use the position and influence they have on Fifa committees and as a national association, to mount a full-blooded lobbying campaign to get these rules changed,” thundered a Premier League spokesman at the time, before what is perhaps the only recorded historical example of his august employers failing to get their own way. As well as Dugarry, the first January window marked the arrival of cult hero Yakubu Aiyegbeni in England following his move from Maccabi Haifa to Portsmouth. The departure of Jonathan Woodgate from Leeds to Newcastle also made headlines, as did Robbie Fowler’s move from Leeds United to Manchester City. In total, Premier League clubs spent £35m between them in that particular window, coincidentally the same amount Liverpool would pay Newcastle for Andy Carroll in January 2011 and £95m less than the clubs of the top flight spent this time last year. Twelve months ago, some wildly excitable soothsayers predicted that Premier League clubs would spend more than £1bn in January, but they eventually coughed up a comparative pittance of £130m. Despite the frenzied excitement it prompts among football fans, the January window is not without its critics. Arsène Wenger and Harry Redknapp are among them, the former known for his extreme frugality, while the latter has long been a reluctant poster-boy and punchline for the often ill-advised wheeler-dealing and horse-trading for which this time of year is increasingly renowned. Famous for his out-of-the-car-window appraisals of assorted “triffic” targets on Sky Sports News, Redknapp was more enthusiastic than most when it came to January panic buys during his time as a manager, but claimed – in the face of all evidence to the contrary – not to enjoy the mayhem of the mid-season livestock mart. Three years ago, he likened that year’s January window to “gang warfare”, saying “every agent seems to be trying to screw each other” in the scramble for money. A few days later, Harry was involved in one of the great deadline day farces. Having driven down to London from the Midlands in what his then manager Steve Clarke described as “an act of total lunacy”, a forlorn and frustrated Peter Odemwingie was left sitting and seething outside Loftus Road in his parked car as West Brom and Redknapp’s QPR failed to agree terms on his transfer. Despite the suspicions of some Arsenal fans who may not be aware of its existence, Wenger has long been critical of the January window, stating it is “unfair”, because championship rivals from the same league can move players between them in a premeditated bid to undermine his team. As conspiracy theories go it’s a mite tinpot and tenuous, but there can be no doubt the current system is far from perfect. With teams scrapping around the foot of the table, the January window breeds no end of panic and desperation while allowing big clubs to unsettle the better players at struggling sides before poaching them. Long may it continue; after 14 years we wouldn’t have it any other way.','https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/jan/01/love-hate-january-transfer-window','Love it or hate it, the January transfer window provides unique excitement | Barry Glendenning',13,'football'),('society/2017/jan/01/one-in-four-babies-miss-out-on-health-visitor-checks-social-mobility-commission','One in four babies born in the UK are not receiving mandatory checkups from health visitors during the first two years of their life. A fifth of babies do not receive the recommended reviews after they turn one, and one in four miss out at the age of two, according to the government’s commission on social mobility. Health visitors, responsible for assessing a child’s early years development, are supposed to carry out checks straight after birth, at six to eight weeks, at one year and then at between two and two-and-a-half years. However, the commission found that one in five children had not received the mandatory 12-month check by the time they reached 15 months old. London children were the least likely to receive the right number of health visits, the report found, with fewer than half receiving the final two checkups. A survey of parents found that the vast majority wanted the health visits to continue, with just 5% saying they did not feel they required advice during their first six months as a parent. “Despite the conventional wisdom that parents fear interference from the ‘nanny state’, in reality many say that they welcome advice in the early years of their child’s life,” the commission said. It said it was concerning that one in four two-year-olds did not have their health and education needs reviewed by a professional. “Despite this being a crucial period for families, there is still too little support for parents in the earliest stage of their child’s life. With the socioeconomic gap in outcomes emerging early, providing support to parents at this point could reap dividends for social mobility later on in life.” The Conservative party’s 2010 manifesto included a key pledge to increase the number of health visitors. NHS Digital figures show the number of full-time or equivalent health visitors in England fell by almost 1,000 between October 2015 and August 2016. In December a survey of health visitors by the Institute of Health Visiting found that 85% of respondents felt their workload had increased in the last two years. Some were having to look after between 500 and 1,000 children, when the maximum recommended is 250. Labour said the commission’s figures showed the government was failing to invest in early years support. Emma Lewell-Buck, the shadow minister for children and families, said: “Becoming a parent for the first time is an exciting but scary time and it is shocking that not all parents are getting the support they need. “The Tories promised more health visitors by taking away money from Sure Start Centres. Six years later we have lost over 700 centres and we are still waiting for the health visitors. The Tories have completely failed to invest these crucial early years.” A spokesperson for Public Health England said: “Ensuring every child has the best start in life is one of our key priorities. We are supporting local authorities in commissioning services that support families and provide early help when needed. “We are also working with councils to give health visitors professional guidance and leadership, as well as evidence of what works, to help them meet their public health responsibilities.” The commission also said parents were finding it more difficult to access local children’s centre services, citing a 2015 survey which found more than 60% of children’s centre managers said they were cutting back on services to meet their budgets. Government figures in December revealed that 156 Sure Start children’s centres had closed in England in 2015, almost double the number in the previous year.','https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/01/one-in-four-babies-miss-out-on-health-visitor-checks-social-mobility-commission','One in four UK babies miss out on health visitor checks',14,'society'),('us-news/2017/jan/01/barack-obama-donald-trump-twitter','Barack Obama on Sunday used Twitter, a medium notoriously favoured by the man who will succeed him in the White House, to tout his achievements in office. “As we look ahead to the future,” Obama wrote in his first tweet, “I wanted to take a moment to look back on the remarkable progress that you made possible these past [eight] years.” From 20 January and for the next four years, barring unforeseen circumstances, Obama’s place in the Oval Office will be taken by the businessman Donald Trump. On Sunday Trump’s incoming White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, told ABC’s This Week the president-elect would continue to use Twitter to announce policy and make comment on current events. The medium, he said, was a way to avoid mainstream media outlets and get his message directly to the American public. Despite widespread concern over the flagrant provocation and outright disregard for protocol displayed by many of Trump’s tweets, Spicer said: “You know what? The fact of the matter is that when he tweets, he gets results.” In an interview with CBS 60 Minutes after his election victory over Hillary Clinton, Trump said that he would now be “very restrained, if I use it at all” regarding social media. He has not achieved that aim. On 28 December, to take one among many examples, he used Twitter to say: “Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks. Thought it was going to be a smooth transition – NOT!” On Sunday, the subject of that tweet sent out sober comments about a number of results he has achieved. “Facing the worst financial crisis in 80 years,” he wrote, “you delivered the longest streak of job growth in our history. “After decades of rising healthcare costs, today nearly every American now has access to the financial security of affordable healthcare.” The latter tweet spoke to a key concern among Democrats, as Trump and Republicans in Congress consider ways to repeal the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. Obama is reportedly arranging a meeting with congressional Democrats to consider ways to preserve his signature legislative achievement. The president’s next tweet hinted at progressive fears over Trump’s nomination of a number of climate change deniers to key positions in his cabinet. Obama continued: “We traded foreign oil for clean energy, we doubled fuel efficiency standards [and] we acted on a global scale to save the one planet we’ve got.” He added: “We brought home more of our troops [and] strengthened US leadership– leading with diplomacy [and] partnering with nations to meet global problems.” Obama also said: “From realizing marriage equality to removing barriers to opportunity, we’ve made history in our work to reaffirm that all are created equal.” In conclusion, the president tweeted: “It’s been the privilege of my life to serve as your president. I look forward to standing with you as a citizen. Happy New Year everybody.” Obama’s @POTUS Twitter account has 12.9 million followers, compared with 18.3 million for @RealDonaldTrump. As of 5pm ET on New Year’s Day, the president-elect had not tweeted anything since a series of celebratory tweets and retweets sent shortly before the turn of the year. Not long before that, he tweeted a supposedly conciliatory message: “Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don’t know what to do.

One area that hasn’t been searched thoroughly is underneath sediments and soils. But how does a modern gold prospector know where to start digging? Ravi Anand, from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), and his colleagues gathered hundreds of samples of sediments, soil and acacia leaves from Moolart Well gold deposit, 400km north-east of Kalgoorlie. After analysing the gold content of all the samples they showed that clusters of gold occurred in zones rich in organic carbon (carbon derived from living material). Their findings are published in Geology. Anand and his colleagues believe that much of the gold in the older sediments came from underlying gold-bearing rock, via chemical and biological processes when the climate was humid. Subsequently, gold was transferred into younger sediments by the action of burrowing creatures, erosion and flooding, during the dry climate phase of the past few million years. The samples from termite mounds and acacia leaves reveal that gold is preferentially absorbed by living material, and suggests that digging deep under gold-rich trees and mounds could lead to veins of gold.','https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jan/01/gold-western-australia-miners-termites-acacia-trees-terrawatch','Look to the leaves for clues to gold deposits',16,'science'),('science/2017/jan/01/the-january-night-sky-meteors-planets-moon-stars-starwatch','The crescent Moon stands between the brilliant evening star Venus and the much fainter Mars on the 2nd.

The protest continued through the game, though play was unaffected. The banner, which read “Divest #NoDAPL” and carried the US Bank logo, was hung in the US Bank Stadium by two people. One of the protesters, wearing a No4 Brett Favre Vikings uniform, rappelled down the banner. Members of the media were reportedly sent a message that said the stunt was designed to urge US Bank to divest from the pipeline project, which is run by Energy Transfer Partners, a Dallas-based company. At halftime, stadium manager SMG released a statement that said: “Two individuals appear to have climbed over a guard rail to access the ridge truss. “We immediately dispatched on-site Minneapolis police and fire departments to the scene and cleared the seating section.” The company said it was working to end the protest “with all stadium partners” and with a “primary focus on the safety of the fans and these two individuals”. Construction on the Dakota Access pipeline was halted in North Dakota in December, after months of confrontation between law enforcement agencies and a coalition of Native Americans and environmentalists protesting potential damage to water resources and tribal sites. In December, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune, protesters with similar demands entered Wells Fargo’s offices in the city and blocked employees on their way to work. Protesters also briefly locked doors to a Wells Fargo branch. In 2014, at an All-Star baseball game at Target Field in Minneapolis, a protester gained access to the large video board and unfurled a banner that read: “Love water not oil.” Organisers of Sunday’s protest contended that US Bank has tens of millions of dollars in credit lines active with the pipeline’s parent company. “The pipeline’s route violates treaty rights of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and poses a significant threat drinking water and the health of the Missouri river,” their message to media reportedly said. Despite the decision by the US Army Corps of Engineers to deny a permit for the pipeline to go under the Missouri river near Standing Rock, there are fears that the incoming Trump administration will reverse that decision and permit the the pipeline’s completion. Energy Transfer Partners, in which Trump was revealed to have invested, took the decision to halt construction to court.','https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/01/standing-rock-protest-minneapolis-nfl-football-game-vikings','Standing Rock protesters unfurl banner over field at Minneapolis NFL game',18,'us-news'),('world/2017/jan/02/burkinis-and-belonging-its-this-feeling-the-beach-and-hijab-dont-mix','When I was 13, I started wearing hijab. I had always loved swimming but had to give it up until my mother bought some Lycra fabric from Lincraft and sewed me a fluorescent pink-and-blue two-piece wetsuit with a matching swimming cap. The local pools refused to admit me wearing the suit but I was free to go to the beach. So go to the beach I did. And yet the feeling that I belonged at the beach, that it was a public space in which I was “in place”, sometimes eluded me. The belief that the beach is open to all runs deep in Australia. Wendy Garden, the curator of last year’s art exhibition On the Beach, wrote that beaches occupied “a privileged place in the national psyche”. “The beach is seen as a great equaliser, where racial, social and gender differences are subordinate to the common pursuit of pleasure in the surf and sun.” But like many of our public spaces, the iconic space of the Australian beach has always privileged a white sensory landscape. What looks and feels and sounds and smells as though it belongs is a function of power relations. Since last summer, events in Europe have sharpened potential conflicts over who and what belongs on the beach. After the terrorist attack in Nice in May, French mayors banned women from wearing burkinis on the beach in dozens of resorts and promised to defy a court ruling that the bans were illegal. At least one woman was fined by police for not wearing an outfit deemed to respect “good morals and secularism”. No such legal moves have been seriously proposed for Australian beaches but the climate is far from relaxed. Speaking to Muslim women from diverse walks of life about their relationship with the beach, what is striking is how their bodies, specifically their dress, have become the dominant site for contests over what is considered “in place” and “out of place” on Australian beaches. Whether it be a hijab over a rash vest and activewear leggings, or the burkini, it seems that the “Muslimness” of this form of dress has the capacity to provoke wary and sometimes hostile reactions. Many of the women I spoke to had a sense that their burkinis and hijabs were considered “out of place”. The staring, the double looks, the raised eyebrows. “It’s this feeling that the beach and hijab don’t mix,” says Sarah, a 28-year-old lawyer (all interviewees asked for full names to be withheld). “People are locked into thinking there’s only one way to dress and enjoy the beach.” Samah laughs when she tells me that before owning a burkini, she wore tights, a long shirt and hijab to swim in and “lay on the sand”. “One time a guy looked at me while we were in the water,” she recounts. “He shook his head with pity and said, ‘Isn’t it a shame you can’t enjoy the sun?’ I laughed it off and responded that I was enjoying the sun. “Mind you, the guy was wearing a long-sleeve rashie and swim cap. I had more skin exposed than he did!” Growing up in Queensland, the beach has always been part of Aisha’s life. But when she started wearing hijab, she says she stopped feeling comfortable because of “how people would stare”. She opted for secluded beaches despite her concerns about swimming in places with no flags or lifeguards. “It was the only way I could feel at ease to swim,” she says. For some the beach has become the opposite of the peculiarly relaxed space of Australian myth. Hana, a 25-year-old journalist, was on the northern beaches of Sydney last month and interpreted the stares she received as a kind of “disgust” that questioned her right even to be on the beach. She says she decided against wearing her burkini and “watered down” her outfit of swimming cap, black tights with board shorts on top and long-sleeve rash vest, to make it less “confronting”. “I can go anywhere in Australia and I feel so comfortable,” she says, “but the beach is the one place that I am fearful of because of the reaction I always receive.” The norms and rules that have been allowed to dominate Australian beaches mean a bathing suit is internalised as natural, much in the same way that in India it is perfectly “natural” for women to wear saris and swim in the ocean. In Egypt, women jump into the Mediterranean wearing their hijabs or niqabs without issue. Another woman, Az, says it is not the job of Muslim women to prove they belong on Australian beaches. What is needed is to hold the mirror up to society and understand why we deem some forms of dress acceptable and others unacceptable. Yet many Muslim women do struggle to overcome the attitudes of others. Sana spent years on what she describes as “a journey of confidence-building” to wear a burkini at the beach. For years she chose not to wear it because she grew up “with a feeling that only people who dress and look a certain way have claim to the beach. The beach is a space which, due to so many societal factors, is synonymous with whiteness, blond-haired, sunburnt-white skin and definitely not fully dressed women.” This is about much more than bikinis v burkinis. Muslim women are particularly aware that what they wear on the beach and how they behave can be used as ammunition for wider culture wars about a mythical “Australian way of life” and “Aussie values”. Anisa is married with three children and her concerns about being a “hijabi at the beach” have deepened since the French bans. “Some women are brave and don’t care,” she says, “but I feel so self-conscious and as though people are judging me and my husband because he’s wearing ‘appropriate’ swimwear whereas I am fully covered. “You can almost feel how they are viewing us as this controlling Muslim man and his poor oppressed wife – if only they knew the real dynamics!” A cultural studies professor, Suvendini Perera, has argued that veiling has become the ultimate marker of cultural difference and that the veiled Muslim woman is “a kind of limit-figure for the nation in the values debate”. It is the awareness that their bodies are repositories for other people’s narratives and stereotypes that burdens all the women I spoke to. And yet many Muslim women resist the negative responses of others to lay claim to their beach space. Abs tells me she “self-counsels” herself: “I constantly tell myself not to care what others are thinking of my appearance. This self-counselling empowers me to enjoy myself and my time with my children.” Samar is just as resolved to ignore the “stares and weird looks” and “rock the burkini when I’m swimming”. For Layla, for whom the beach “washes away stress and anxiety”, presumptions that she cannot swim and is “weighed down” by her burkini only make her laugh. It’s not simply that these women use the beach in spite of being positioned as “out of place”. They seek to redefine “out of place”, challenging dominant assumptions and sensory reactions to their presence. Layla’s relationship with the beach has evolved from a site of resistance to the staring and comments, to a place which she says she has “trained myself to think of as my space too”.','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/02/burkinis-and-belonging-its-this-feeling-the-beach-and-hijab-dont-mix','Burkinis and belonging: \'It\'s this feeling the beach and hijab don\'t mix\'',19,'world'),('us-news/2017/jan/01/second-avenue-subway-new-york-new-year','New Yorkers got their first chance to ride a new subway extension on Sunday, after almost 100 years of planning and construction. To loud cheers, the first Q train to run from 96th Street in Manhattan to Coney Island set off soon after noon. New York governor Andrew Cuomo was aboard to celebrate an engineering project his administration has made a matter of state and city pride. “It’s the inaugural ride,” Cuomo told a large crowd who pushed their way into the subway cars. “It’s exciting, and it’s a great way to start the new year here in New York.” The completion of the $4.4bn Second Avenue line – technically a four-stop extension of the Q – is a substantial achievement for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The line was conceived in 1929, at the height of the Jazz Age, and its construction started 45 years ago, in 1972. It stopped soon after when the city ran out of money. The project restarted in 2007 and was completed on time. The nearly two-mile segment adds stations along Second Avenue in the Upper East Side, at 96th, 86th and 72nd streets, and a new connection to an existing line at 63rd. City planners have long considered the extension critical to easing congestion on a system that carries 5.6 million riders on an average weekday. On Sunday, Second Avenue residents expressed excitement over their new mobility but also anxiety over whether the line would hasten gentrification in an area widely regarded as one of the last comparatively affordable spots in Manhattan, a borough where the average apartment price hit $2m last year. “The rents might go up a bit but it’ll bring way more customers to the restaurants on Second Avenue,” said Pam Miller, who was riding the Q with her son, Ben. Makeup artist Toby Klinger, 36, said the extension would make the area more livable. “I’ve been living on Second Avenue almost my whole life and we’re already seeing rapid gentrification,” she said. Klinger rejected the notion that with the help of the new line and the planned closure and renovation of the L train to Brooklyn, the Upper East Side might become a new Williamsburg – home to a surging population of millennials in hipster uniform. “I like being the only hipster,” said Klinger. “It used to be a very diverse neighbourhood with a mixture of white, black, Latino and Arab families, and it’s becoming a place for young professionals to dock their iPhones. The character of the neighbourhood is changing completely.” Alan Behr, a lawyer, said the opening would allow a far easier commute to Midtown. The construction of the line had already changed the neighbourhood, he said, with local stores losing business as a result of the disruption. Behr, 62, doubted the new line would lead to a rapid transformation. “The Upper East Side is a much quieter neighborhood than downtown,” he said. “When a woman was killed in a hit and run at 10.30 at night, nobody saw it because everyone was asleep. “But in New York, when you can get from here to there, it’s always a pro. Anything that gets mass transit running faster is a good. The prices may go up but at least we’re going faster. This is our first new foray into mass transit, and that’s important for us.” Amid the positivity, there were some dissenting voices. Bienvenida Rodriguez, who said she had lived in the neighbourhood for 37 years, said the construction had been “noisy and scary”. “We’ve had explosions,” she said, “sometimes we had no water. It’s been rough for the people living here. I hope now it won’t be dangerous but I’m afraid the homeless will come here now. So we’re praying for the best.” Other passengers, however, noted that the new stations were a vast improvement on the city’s existing stations, many of which date to the early 20th century. The new stations feature striking artwork. At 96th Street, the transportation authority commissioned Sarah Sze, who represented the US at the Venice Biennale in 2013. Her new works use the intense blue of Spanish pottery. At 86th Street, Chuck Close has created 12 large-scale portraits of subjects including composer Philip Glass, the late Lou Reed and three other painters, Cecily Brown, Alex Katz and Kara Walker. Elsewhere, there is work by Vik Muniz, Jean Shin, Zhang Huan and Sienna Shields. “It’s fabulous,” said another passenger, Lauren Michaels. “The trains are bright, the concourse is clean and I’ve been reading about the artwork, which looks pretty interesting. “I like the way they chose a different artist for each station, and actually doing art. Let’s see how it wears.” More than2,000 people worked on the extension, tunneling through granite and digging through sand and mud. The line is also meant to run north through Harlem and ultimately into the Bronx but no date has been set for that phase of construction. “This was a long time coming,” noted Cuomo as the first train pulled out. Disembarking at 86th Street, the governor offered a jovial assessment of his trip. “There’s no steering wheel and no brakes so it was a good thing they wouldn’t let me drive,” said Cuomo, who is reported to be eyeing a 2020 presidential run against another prominent New Yorker, Donald Trump. “I was along for the ride. It was the first ride and it was a great one.”','https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/01/second-avenue-subway-new-york-new-year','Second Avenue subway gives New York reason to cheer – and fear – the new year',20,'us-news'),('football/blog/2017/jan/01/donkey-scorpion-olivier-giroud-volley-arsenal-crystal-palace','On a sodden, cold and otherwise underpowered afternoon at the Emirates Stadium Olivier Giroud provided an unforgettable moment of illumination. The Frenchman has found himself down the pecking order in recent months, demoted to second choice as collateral damage to Alexis Sánchez’s reinvention as a spiky central striker. One thing does seem certain, though. Whatever direction Giroud’s strangely divisive five-year Arsenal career takes from here, however the club’s hotly-contested modern history ends up remembering him, he is unlikely to have a better moment, in isolation, than the opening goal here. Olivier, old boy, we’ll always have Palace. What are we calling it then? A Henrikh? A studs-up, reach-back semi-scorpion? Perhaps the greatest no-look donkey-kick breakaway volley you’re likely to see outside the pixelated world of early 1990s arcade machines? Certainly Henrikh Mkhitaryan does seem have been on to something with his discovery of the sole-of-the-boot, reach-around volley. Giroud’s version, the opener in this 2-0 defeat of a disappointing Crystal Palace, was even better. The build-up was wonderfully slick. Lucas Pérez won the ball and slipped it to Héctor Bellerín. Giroud’s back-heel found Granit Xhaka, who passed to Alex Iwobi. He did exactly the right thing at exactly the right speed, driving forward and zipping an instant pass to Sánchez. Sánchez paused, looked up and floated a cross just behind Giroud as he rumbled into the box. Hmmm. What to do now? Hang on. In a moment of extreme, imaginative spatial awareness Giroud stretched his left foot up behind his shoulder and sent the ball arcing off his studs past his own left ear and over Wayne Hennessey. With an added gloss the ball even had the presence of mind to clang in off the underside of the crossbar, thereby adding a 20% premium on goal of the season scores, a principle known as Yeboah’s Law. Giroud, charming as ever, laughed afterwards and said his finish was lucky, that he was off balance and just made something up in the moment. It was certainly a fluke in the sense that nobody could realistically hope to do it again. As the ball crossed the line there was an odd moment of hush around the Emirates, the air seeming to disappear out of the stadium then rush back in with a gulp at the pure audacity of a moment that had little in common with the angsty bustle that made up most of the opening 45 minutes. Or indeed little in common with the recent trajectory of Giroud’s Arsenal career. The absence from recent starting XIs is a consequence in part of his own late return from the Euro 2016 final. But Giroud remains an oddly divisive figure, a cumbersome No9 who can look both immobile and also razor sharp, blunt and brilliantly bullish, at times all within the same attack. His start here was just his second in the league this season. Arsenal have looked sharper and more direct in his absence. But he still has six Premier League goals in his last four starts, albeit across seven months since the end of last season. Indeed, his goalscoring record is good throughout his entire time at Arsenal, even if the impression remains of a fine plan B dressed up in the ill-fitting tinsel of a first choice A-lister. The transition from Robin van Persie, a glistening, pedigree, title-winning striker replaced by a hopeful workhorse seemed to sum up, for some, the frustrations of the late austerity years. Giroud scores at a similar rate to the man he replaced. But critics will say he just doesn’t seem to do so at the right time, or against the right teams, or with the right degree of match-sealing elan. Shortly before his goal here he missed an absolute sitter, failing to connect in front of goal as Nacho Monreal flashed a volleyed cross though the six-yard box. The ball was skimming and slick on the surface. But being in place to prod those in is pretty much the job, not the one-off worldie back-flick stuff. In one sense even that wondrous opening goal was simply a large, quite slow man falling over to brilliant effect, a moment of pub-football art. Giroud’s own reaction was lovely, pure joy but also laughter. In the seats the home fans also giggled and danced and hugged rather than just punching the air and acting as though this was anything other than an isolated moment of extreme skill, plus an indication of the basic fun, the occasional silliness of sport. Arsenal scored again on 56 minutes, this time through a well-placed header from Iwobi. Giroud’s moment aside Iwobi was their best player and most significant presence. Given a chance to play at No10 in Mesut Özil’s absence through illness, Iwobi had a fine game. Socks half-rolled down, not exactly quick but persistent, not exactly powerful but tenacious, he was careful with the ball, and always looking to drive forward and inflict pain on the Palace defence. Arsène Wenger was generous in his praise afterwards. Seasons rarely turn on fine moments, and Arsenal’s fans will take just as much heart form Iwobi’s craft as they will from a goal that will live long in the memory.','https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/jan/01/donkey-scorpion-olivier-giroud-volley-arsenal-crystal-palace','Donkey or scorpion? Olivier Giroud’s volley defies classification | Barney Ronay',21,'football'),('commentisfree/2017/jan/02/trump-brexit-left-progressives-aghast-they-should-be-emboldened','In 2017, how might progressives win? Even posing the question feels odd – almost a category error – since “winning” scarcely exists as a referent in so much of progressive practice. The late Peter Cook used to perform a sketch in which he played a leftie working for the media empire of Lord Beaverbrook (think Rupert Murdoch). Cook assures his friend that he remains as radical as ever. “There are about 10 of us on the paper, young, progressive, liberal people who don’t believe a word we are writing, and whenever the old man has a party – a cocktail party – we all gather together down the far end of the room and drink as much as we can – we really knock it back – we drink and drink and drink – trying to break him from within; then – quite openly, behind our hands – we snigger at him.’ The friend looks doubtful: “Well, it doesn’t seem very much to me – sniggering and tittering.” “A titter there, a titter here,” says Cook. “It all adds up.” That’s very familiar today. On the left, we spend our time calling out and shutting down, lolling and meming and dropping mics. But winning? What does that even mean? Let’s put the problem another way. Traditionally, progressives defined themselves, at least in part, by a desire for change. The right defended the status quo; the left agitated to overthrow or at least ameliorate it. Progressives sought progress, movement, transformation, forcing the old to give to the new until we’d built a modern Jerusalem. The instability of 2016 will continue. You can feel it everywhere: all that is solid preparing to melt into air. With change so palpably afoot, this should be our time. So why isn’t it? In 1939, WH Auden wrote The Unknown Citizen to satirise the managerial revolution already then under way. Today, the poem reads like an eerie anticipation of liberal incredulity at Brexit and Trump and the other recent upheavals. Was he free? Was he happy? The question is absurd: Had anything been wrong, we should certainly have heard. In theory, progressives recognise the necessity of fundamental social change. In practice, we’ve responded to explosive manifestations of discontent with a mixture of fury and disbelief, aghast not just at the reactionary sentiments expressed but at the very existence of a dissatisfaction about which we knew nothing whatsoever. All over the world, pollsters report deep unhappiness with the institutions of liberal capitalism. Yet somehow the left – a movement dedicated to social transformation – has become the defender of a status quo that no one much else likes. Francis Adams was also a poet (though far less distinguished than Auden). In 1889, he explained his parallel career as an activist: “Five years ago, I broke up my health in the struggle then just beginning to organise the unskilled London labour. It seemed a failure. But I never despaired, or saw cause to despair. There was a splendid foundation of hate there. With hate, all things are possible.” It’s difficult to imagine a progressive saying that today: the formulation sounds more like a grab from one of those well-coiffured Nazi boys currently clinging to Trump’s coattails. Actually, though, Adams was a gentle and sensitive man, a rare opponent of the anti-Asian racism dominating the Australian labour movement. What he meant was that the London workers found their situation intolerable – and their justified anger fuelled the New Unionism that transformed British politics. Well, there’s a splendid foundation of hate today, too – and if we don’t build something positive from it, the edifices that will inevitably emerge will be very ugly indeed. Unfortunately, so much of what passes for activism now centres on an individualised moralism, less about changing the world than about making yourself feel (or perhaps sound) good while all about you everything remains exactly the same. In 1959, Raymond Williams described the seemingly insurmountable gulf between the progressive intellectuals of his day and the great bulk of the population. “Nothing,” he wrote, “has done more to sour the democratic idea among its natural supporters, and to drive them back into angry self-exile, than the plain, overwhelming cultural issues: the apparent division of our culture into, on the one hand, a remote and self-gracious sophistication, on the other hand, a doped mass.” Since, then, of course, that division has only widened. The academic Colin Crouch describes a tendency to “post-democracy”, in which “public electoral debate is a tightly controlled spectacle, managed by rival teams of professionals expert in the techniques of persuasion, and considering a small range of issues selected by those teams [while] the mass of citizens plays a passive, quiescent part, responding only to the signals given them.” We all know exactly what he means. But that’s why it’s worth rereading Williams. After all, many progressives reacted to Brexit and to Trump by demanding more rather than less state control over the citizenry. Aghast at the reactionary ideas that emerged during those votes (the misogyny, the xenophobia, the outright racism), they concluded that ordinary people couldn’t be trusted and needed better, more efficient management from the political class. To put it another way, confronted by widespread hatred for “post-democracy”, they doubled-down on the “post’ bit rather than the “democracy” aspect. Williams suggests a very different orientation. “So who then believes in democracy?” he asks. “The answer is really quite simple: the millions … who still haven’t got it where they work and feel. There, as always, is the transforming energy … ” He sees the resistance to top-down management, the desire for self-expression and self-determination in the workplace and the school and the home, as an opportunity for the left, not a threat. “The business of the socialist intellectual is what it always was: to attack the clamps on that energy – in industrial relations, public administration, education, for a start; to work in his own field on ways in which that energy, as released, can be concentrated and fertile.” It’s a challenging formulation as we approach 2017, flying in the face of what’s become progressive common sense: the condescending conviction that only enlightened liberal stewardship stands between civilisation and the hordes of tabloid-reading Morlocks. But Williams recognises that, too. “The technical means [of facilitating participatory democracy] are difficult enough,’ he says, “but the biggest difficulty is in accepting, deep in our minds, the values on which they depend: that the ordinary people should govern … ” That’s not to deny the genuinely disturbing racism manifesting in the US and across Europe. On the contrary, it’s to suggest a strategy – or at least the raw beginnings of one – to combat it. Williams’s point is that a left orienting to participation, to mass involvement and to democracy stands a better chance of overcoming the demagoguery of the far right through what he calls “the transforming energy” of the masses, since people exercising some control over their workplaces, their universities, their homes and cultural lives are less susceptible to the imaginary “solutions” of scapegoating and bigotry. No one can offer a blueprint for activism in 2017. The only certainty in times like this is that certainties will be confounded. Nonetheless, it’s difficult to believe that, in societies governed by some of the least popular leaders on record (from Trump to Turnbull), the next 12 months won’t bring further eruptions of discontent. How then will we respond? The temptation will be, once again, to defend liberal values by reinforcing the institutions of liberalism. But that’s not going to work. Quite simply, progressives must discover progress. Rather than buttressing a moribund status quo, the left needs to place itself on the side of change. That’s how we win – by reclaiming the notion of a better future from the reactionaries and demagogues.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/02/trump-brexit-left-progressives-aghast-they-should-be-emboldened','Trump and Brexit left progressives aghast.

He had been about 12 yards out at the point of the connection. Alex Iwobi scored Arsenal’s second to crown an impressive individual display, which lifted his team back into third place in the Premier League, above Tottenham Hotspur, who had won 4-1 at Watford earlier in the day. But the occasion at the Emirates Stadium was all about Giroud’s moment of magic, which carried shades of Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s finish for Manchester United against Sunderland on Boxing Day. “It was an exceptional goal, because it was at the end of a fantastic collective movement, which is what our game is about,” Wenger said, with a nod towards the box-to-box counterattack. “After that, it was a reflex. Any goal-scorer is ready to take any part of his body, even if it’s the little toe, to score a goal and Olivier had that kind of reflex. He transformed that goal, I would say, into art. “It was art because of the surprise, because of the beauty of the movement and because of the efficiency of the movement. That will be remembered as the ‘Giroud goal’, which nobody will forget. Every striker is certainly remembered for one or two or three special goals and that will certainly remain with him forever. “Olivier brings the unexpected and we all come to football to get the unexpected. I have been spoiled in my career because I had many great strikers but that is certainly in my top five [of great goals].” Héctor Bellerín, the Arsenal right-back, said that he “couldn’t believe it” when the goal went in but Giroud was modest. “I have maximum luck,” he said. “I was off balance and I tried to deflect it – in this position, you can’t do something else. I’ve never done this before, so it’s all about luck. It’s a great feeling.” Wenger was asked to list the other goals in his top five and, off the top of his head, he actually named five. “I remember [Dennis] Bergkamp at Leicester and at Newcastle; Thierry Henry at Real Madrid and at Liverpool, and Kanu at Chelsea. It’s difficult for me to say, over 20 years, when we score about 70, 80 per year. By 20, it makes 1,600. It’s hard, in a second, to get the best five. “The importance of the game matters, and also when it’s 0-0. What is maybe not acknowledged enough by people, maybe even me, is that Olivier scores important goals. “He equalised at Man United this season [in the 89th minute] with the special header and he scored [the winner] against West Brom in the 86th minute. He scores goals that have weight in the result of the team.”','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/01/arsene-wenger-olivier-giroud-crystal-palace-work-of-art','Arsène Wenger calls Olivier Giroud goal against Crystal Palace ‘a work of art’',23,'football'),('society/2017/jan/01/seven-day-nhs-plan-puts-weekday-surgeries-at-risk-warns-top-gp','Britain’s top GP has said surgeries will have to stop seeing patients during the week unless ministers abandon their drive to guarantee access to family doctors at weekends. Dr Helen Stokes-Lampard condemned the policy, a key Conservative pledge, as unrealistic and said it was ignoring the lack of demand among patients to see GPs at weekends and a serious shortage of family doctors. The government has promised to ensure that people in every part of England will be able to see a GP from 8am to 8pm every day of the week by 2020 as a key element of its push to create a “truly seven-day NHS” by the end of the current parliament. “It’s unrealistic in the current climate. We haven’t got the people, we haven’t got the resources. If you give people access on a Sunday afternoon they’re not going to have access on a Tuesday morning. They can’t have it all”, the chair of the Royal College of GPs said in an interview. Calling for surgeries weekend opening to be restricted to Saturday mornings, Stokes-Lampard said: “We should be responding to what is needed in an area, and balance that realistically by what can be provided safely. Because quite frankly if you open on a Sunday afternoon but you’re closed on a Tuesday morning, who’s going to benefit?. There is so little demand from patients to see a GP on Sundays that plans to compel at least one surgery in each area to open on that day by 2020 should be dropped, she said. Nor do many people want to attend a surgery on a Saturday afternoon, she added. David Cameron pledged access to GPs from 8am to 8pm seven days a week at the Conservative party conference in 2014, and established a £50m “challenge fund” to deliver it. Some surgeries that have begun opening at weekends, however, have scrapped their experiment because of the small numbers of patients seeking appointments on Saturdays and Sundays. A relentless rise in the need for care is prompting more GPs to retire early or move abroad, leaving the profession facing a growing workforce crisis and patients facing long waits for appointments, Stokes-Lampard said. As a result “we’re layered too thin at the moment, we’re spread too thin. We can’t sustain a good five-day service at the moment, a seven-day service is unrealistic. If we can’t provide eight to six Monday to Friday because we’re stretched to breaking point, we’re certainly not going to be able to provide seven days a week.” She said general practice was “closer to the edge than it has ever been in living memory”, and cast serious doubt on ministers being able to fulfil another key NHS pledge – to increase the number of GPs in England by 5,000 by 2020 compared with 2015. It will be very hard to deliver that number without many GPs coming from overseas or former doctors being persuaded back into work, she said. The Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb, who was a coalition health minister until May 2015, denounced the pledge of access to GPs all day and every day as a “superficially attractive gimmick”. “This target is driven by seductive headlines, not sound policy. It will distort priorities and resources away from action which could make a real difference to people’s lives, such as ensuring that people have both their physical and mental health needs effectively met in primary care,” he said. “No one believes that there will be sufficient resources to deliver this plan. The risk is that it will leave dangerous gaps in provision during the week. “Pursuing superficially attractive gimmicks like this amounts to a smokescreen for the dire threat the NHS and care system now faces as it is starved of the resources it needs to provide effective, prompt and safe care.” The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: “These serious doubts about a flagship government pledge will raise widespread concerns. It’s yet another warning about the scale of the underfunding and understaffing now impacting our NHS. “In her six months as prime minister Theresa May has shown no regard for the state of the NHS, so it’s no surprise it now looks like her own manifesto commitments will be broken. “But in 2017 the government simply must not carry on ignoring the warnings. Instead they need to come forward with a genuine plan to give the NHS and social care the resources they need to deliver the very best care every patient deserves.” The Department of Health insisted the government would achieve its ambition of seven-day opening, and that the policy was popular. “This is a common sense reform with wide public support, and one we will deliver”, a spokeswoman said. “People don’t just get ill Monday to Friday, nine to five, and 18 million patients now have weekend and extended access to a GP, which has already shown evidence of relieving pressure on other parts of the NHS. “To deliver our pledge, we are putting an extra £2.4bn into GP services, which will help expand the workforce.”','https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/01/seven-day-nhs-plan-puts-weekday-surgeries-at-risk-warns-top-gp','Seven-day NHS plan puts weekday surgeries at risk, warns top GP',24,'society'),('world/2017/jan/01/turkey-nightclub-shooting-reina-nightclub-istanbul-victims-search-continues','Istanbul is on high alert as the hunt for a gunman, who fled after killing 39 people at a nightclub on New Year’s Eve, continues. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan vowed in a statement that Turkey would fight terrorism “till the end” following the attack at Reina in Istanbul’s upmarket Ortaköy neighbourhood. “Turkey will stand together and not give passage to dirty games of terrorists,” he said. Mehmet Görmez, Turkey’s most senior Muslim cleric, condemned the attack as “savagery” and a “massacre that no Muslim conscience can accept”. There was condemnation from around the world as well as inside Turkey. The US State Department described the attack as “heinous” and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said it was “hard to imagine a more cynical crime”. The attack came at the end of a year of terrorist incidents across Europe, including the driving of a truck into a Christmas market in Berlin earlier in December. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, sent her condolences to the victims of the Istanbul attack, saying “terrorists ... have carried out an inhumane and devious attack on people who wanted to celebrate the new year together”. A Downing Street spokesman said Theresa May had written to Erdoğan after the attack to offer her condolences. “She said her thoughts were with the Turkish people after this further devastating terrorist attack, and confirms the UK stands ready to help,” No 10 said. In his new year’s address, Pope Francis said: “Unfortunately, violence has stricken even in this night of good wishes and hope. Pained, I express my closeness to the Turkish people. I pray for the many victims and for the wounded and for the entire nation in mourning. “I ask the Lord to sustain all men of good will to courageously roll up their sleeves to confront the plague of terrorism and this stain of blood that is covering the world with a shadow of fear and a sense of loss.” The gunman entered Reina, a club on the Bosphorus that has long been a favourite of tourists, a little after 1am, shot a police officer and then opened fire inside the club with a Kalashnikov rifle, before fleeing the scene. Istanbul’s governor, Vasip Şahin, told reporters: “At 1.15am, a terrorist carrying a long-barrelled weapon martyred the police officer waiting outside, and then martyred another citizen to enter. He then carried out this violent and cruel act by spraying bullets on innocent people who were celebrating the new year.” The interior minister, Süleyman Soylu, said the gunman was still at large, after reports initially said the attacker was killed. Police were deployed around key areas of the city and several roads near the scene of the attack were closed off. Witnesses described scenes of chaos as revellers attempted to flee, some even throwing themselves into the Bosphorus to escape the gunfire. Outside Şişli Etfal hospital, Sinem Uyanık said she had been at the club with her husband, who was wounded in the attack. “Before I could understand what was happening, my husband fell on top me,” she told Associated Press. “I had to lift several bodies from on top of me before I could get out. It was frightening.” She said her husband’s condition was not serious. It was unclear how the attacker managed to escape from the club, which is just across the street from a police station. One report suggested he abandoned his weapon and mingled with the crowd outside pretending to be an injured civilian. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack. Turkey’s prime minister, Binali Yıldırım, said an investigation into the identity of the gunman was ongoing but he was not prepared to share details yet. There was conflicting information on Sunday evening about the identities of the foreigners who were killed in the attack. Selin Doğan, an opposition politician from Istanbul who toured the hospitals and the morgue at the forensic institute, said the dead included citizens from Saudi Arabia, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Tunisia, Kuwait and Israel, as well as a Belgian-Turkish dual national and a Canadian-Iraqi. The Jordanian foreign ministry said three of its citizens were also killed in the attack. Among the victims was a Tunisian couple and twins from Saudi Arabia. Doğan said the dead all had gunshot wounds and that 11 bodies had been delivered to their families. Turkey has endured numerous terror attacks over the past year by Islamic State militants and Kurdish separatist groups. Three weeks ago a twin bombing outside the football stadium in the district of Beşiktaş killed 46 people, most of them police officers, two hours after a football match. The latest attack has again shaken a country that endured a string of high profile bombings, including in the busy Atatürk airport last summer and near the Hagia Sophia mosque, as well as an attempted military coup in July. Shortly after the nightclub attack, relatives of local staff gathered outside the police cordon to await news of their loved ones. Two men collapsed in tears and sobbed upon receiving news that a relative had died in the attack. Another man who was in the club described a chaotic scene with people rushing for the exits, but was in too much shock to offer a detailed account of the assault. At the forensic institute in Istanbul, some families gathered to collect the bodies of the victims. Stephanie Deek, a Lebanese woman, said her friend was with her husband at the club when the attack happened. “They were just tourists, married for five months, and they wanted to find the perfect place to spend New Year’s Eve,” said Deek. The husband, a 35-year old Lebanese man called Haykal Musallem, was in the bathroom when the attack began. His wife rushed out of the club, while he apparently attempted to jump into the Bosphorus to flee, but was killed. “I’m feeling so sad,” she said. “I can’t even talk or express my feelings.” But there was also anger at what some saw as heightened polarisation and rhetoric in the run-up to the attack. Conservative clerics and media outlets have railed against the sinfulness of new year’s celebrations in recent days. Tabloid newspapers with deeply religious audiences ran headlines such as: “This is a last warning: do not celebrate” and: “Down with your civilisation” with images of party-goers next to images of deprivation in Syria, where nearly half a million people have been killed in an ongoing civil war. The target of the attack prompted some observers to see it as directed against Turkey’s secular character, in the midst of an ongoing struggle to define the republic’s identity. Akif Hamzaçebi, a lawmaker from the Republican People’s party (CHP), described the assault as an “attack on a way of life” and and said it was “savage”. “The aim is to plant seeds of hatred among society,” he said, speaking after visiting the wounded in Istanbul’s Şişli Etfal hospital. “We do not want to live with the acceptance of terror and the state should teach a lesson to the terrorist organisations.” An influential CHP deputy from Istanbul, Gürsel Tekin, said at the hospital: “In the coming days we should be talking about this – in the last week there were so many messages which can damage our social peace but none of these messages were investigated. Those responsible should resign.” Gülsin Harman contributed to this report','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/01/turkey-nightclub-shooting-reina-nightclub-istanbul-victims-search-continues','Turkey nightclub shooting: Istanbul mourns as police hunt gunman',25,'world'),('football/2017/jan/01/tottenham-hotspur-chelsea-match-preview','Mauricio Pochettino has referenced his Tottenham side’s performance at Stamford Bridge on 26 November as a turning point of sorts in the season.

The pair looked beaten as the 2-1 favourite, L’Ami Serge, went clear on the run-in but Kelly regathered her mount and drove him back in front as the line came. Kelly and her stepfather, Nick Williams, who trained both her winners, have had a troubled start to this jumps season. From April to December, she managed only three victories, while Williams’s stable had just a couple more. Their period in the doldrums was the more surprising for following so soon after a Grade One success with Tea For Two last season and Agrapart’s win in the Betfair, Europe’s most valuable handicap hurdle. The 23-year-old Kelly said after Agrapart’s return to the winner’s enclosure in this Grade Two: “This horse is a legend. I knew he had a great shout. We came in quietly at 16-1 but the way he won the Betfair, I knew he’d stay further and it’s rained all day, which was always going to suit him. “It’s been a real hard season up to now. I know I’m trying my best out there and it is difficult, watching race after race with no real results. Fingers crossed this continues now. “I had a double at Towcester on Boxing Day a few seasons ago and in point-to-points back in the day, but this is easily my most significant double.” Kelly is the only woman to have ridden a Grade One winner in British jump racing. While professional female jump jockeys remain in short supply, five of them enjoyed wins around the country yesterday, the others being Lucy Alexander, Lucy Gardner, Megan Carberry and Bridget Andrews. Williams said Agrapart would now be aimed at the Stayers’ Hurdle over an extra half-mile, since the horse might lack the pace for races over the Relkeel distance once the ground dries up in March. But the Stayers’ has a strong favourite in Unowhatimeanharry and bookmakers were sufficiently relaxed about the threat posed by Agrapart to leave him on 33-1. Coo Star Sivola, who also scored for Kelly and Williams, is probably not good enough for a place in the Festival’s Neptune Novice Hurdle. The trainer suggested he might line up instead in the Martin Pipe Handicap, a race for conditional jockeys in which Kelly is able to take part. Nicky Henderson was foiled by the defeat of L’Ami Serge, whose jockey, Daryl Jacob, had a mud-slathered boot slip out of its stirrup in the closing stages. But the Lambourn trainer won the other Grade Two on the card when Whisper held off the odds-on favourite, Clan Des Obeaux, by half a length. Twice a Grade One winner over hurdles in years gone by, Whisper was in lifeless form last season but is unbeaten in two runs this winter, both over fences at Cheltenham. On this occasion, he benefited from a badly timed mistake by his main rival at the second-last. “He’s just tough and genuine and is a real friend,” said Henderson, who suggested the nine-year-old’s Festival target would be the JLT, while adding the caveat that Whisper may yet step up to three miles for the RSA. “The key question now is whether he has a run before the Festival. He doesn’t need to have one.” Willy Twiston-Davies rode his first winner at Cheltenham aboard Cogry, five years after being unseated from Baby Run with the Foxhunter Chase at his mercy. The jockey has been riding on the Flat for most of the intervening period but has recently taken a break from that and suggested here that the endless round of all-weather racing had ceased to grip him. The jockey’s father, Nigel, who trains Cogry, was delighted for his son and also for the horse, who was seeking a boost to his confidence after two falls, an unseat and a brought-down, from four starts over fences this season. “That’s what they both needed,” said Twiston-Davies Sr. “The horse had a miserable time and none of those things had been his fault. Ever since his last fall we thought we would give up over fences for one or two races. His jumping was just impeccable. It was so great that William could ride him.”','https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/01/lizzie-kelly-big-double-cheltenham-agrapart-women-riders-horse-racing','Lizzie Kelly back in the headlines with big double at Cheltenham',27,'sport'),('sport/2017/jan/02/short-memories-as-australian-selectors-return-to-all-rounder-obsession','Australia’s squad for the summer-ending Sydney is often anomalous. A turning wicket, a dead series or even a new year can lend an incongruity to the summer preceding it. Mitch Marsh and Peter Nevill batted at three and four respectively at the SCG last year. It’s where Colin Miller once opened the bowling and Stuart MacGill would always get a game. Of all home Tests, this is the one where the course, broadly speaking, truly appears to dictate the horse. In that sense it’s a convenient setting for selectors to mask the abandonment of its short-lived “six specialist batsmen” policy, instead racing back into the arms of the all-rounder who can “do a bit of both”. Their fondness for the player who serves as insurance against fast bowling fatigue and injury is well understood, even if said player’s actual effectiveness isn’t. Australia’s recent series losses to England, Sri Lanka and South Africa were largely built on paltry batting returns; securing twenty wickets was rarely an issue. Hilton Cartwright might promise the fast bowling cadre an extra breather, but at what cost to Australian runs? Glibly speaking, cricket teams have 11 players and the sixth spot is its mathematical middle. As such, the style of player selected there reveals much about the team’s approach. Amid the extensive praise for Asad Shafiq’s superb innings in Brisbane laid an uncomfortable question for Australia: when was the last time a number six influenced a match so heavily for the men in green and gold? Beneath it sits a deeper question at the heart of Australia’s approach to its number six role: what does the team need more help with? Batting or bowling? Australian cricket – so often purveyor of confidence and simplicity – is unaccustomed to tying itself in philosophical knots, though something shifted about ten years ago. After a reasonably stable commitment to six batsmen, four bowlers and a keeper, selectors uncharacteristically uprooted policy. Maybe it was Adam Gilchrist’s retirement, maybe it was Andrew Flintoff’s destruction, maybe they were scared of life post-Warne (some of us still are), but from late 2005, selectorial orthodoxy was abandoned in a desperate search for an Australian all-rounder to call its own; someone to win matches with profound contributions in both disciplines, who could compound that value by shouldering a load that would leave their specialists fresh. In other words, someone approaching the perfect cricketer. Throughout history, there hasn’t been many. Of course, Australia never found its Freddie. It found Shane Watson, though to most he never seemed enough. As the search continues, history will be increasingly kind to him. The futility of Australia’s search revealed more about the rare brilliance of Flintoff than anything else. Unable to find an antipodean equivalent Australia lowered its bar a little. Instead of an intense, passionate, match-winning heartthrob with bat and ball, it’s since sought players who can “help out a bit” in both parts of the game; the real “chip in” Test cricketer. After Watson, Mitchell Marsh was bequeathed the role. He proved able-enough foil with the ball, providing those so-treasured 10 to 15 overs to relieve the bowling cartel. But he didn’t score enough runs and people started to pine again for a Real Australian Number Six. And besides, what good was a potent attack if it had no runs to bowl to? Marsh, as bowling all-rounders are wont to do, bolstered the bowling but robbed the batting. The role has always had the feel of robbing Peter to pay Paul. So selectors reverted to the pre-2005 convention. Six batsmen, four bowlers and a keeper. Callum Ferguson and Nic Maddinson – earmarked prodigies from successive generations – were brought in to once again uphold the lofty traditions of the position once held by proper run scorers: Walters, Waugh, Ponting and Martyn, to name a few. Both selections polarised opinion, but there was a deeper point beneath. Australia had shifted strategy. Once again, they would select the best players in each of cricket’s primary disciplines. The role-player was vanquished. But the break-up always felt temporary. Unhelped by Maddinson’s quadruple failures, Australian bowling coach David Saker’s recent comments suggested the all-rounder – once it got its act together – would always be welcomed back in the house. Put forward by Cricket Australia to speak at a Test match press conference on behalf of the Australian Cricket team, in Australian cricket uniform, as one of its senior coaches, he claimed to be an outsider without influence as he unequivocally plumped for another bowler to help the quicks. “We are desperately looking for that all-rounder who can bowl some overs for us,” Saker said. The comments arrived after Pakistan had posted 450 in Brisbane followed by 443 on a comatose MCG wicket. Naturally, if you’re overworked and unsupported you appeal for help. Nurses, teachers and anyone who’s ever had a tough job will empathise. It’s uncertain whom Saker was referring to by “we”. Further, how Nic Maddinson was to interpret those comments ahead of his final, and failing, shot says much about how temporary he really was, and how wedded Australia is to the all-rounder number six. So Australia returns to the role player. It’s a curious phenomenon in long form cricket. For a game requiring such exclusive expertise in two separate disciplines – where being proficient at even one is hard enough – how teams can contrive to find a place for someone not singularly expert in either appears counterintuitive. And whereas Australia’s batting group waited years for a policy shift, two long innings’ was all it took for a reversal. This turnaround reveals much: how important Australia’s fast bowlers are to winning, how little it trusts its spinners, and how reliant it is on the triumvirate of Smith, Warner and Khawaja to post competitive totals.','https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/02/short-memories-as-australian-selectors-return-to-all-rounder-obsession','Short memories as Australian selectors return to all-rounder obsession | Sam Perry',28,'sport'),('football/2017/jan/01/mauricio-pochettino-spurs-chelsea-premier-league-white-hart-lane','Mauricio Pochettino wants to harness the sort of feeling that surrounded Leicester’s run to the title last season when Tottenham face the leaders Chelsea on Wednesday and believes the rest of the Premier League will be cheering for his team. Tottenham pulled to within 10 points of Antonio Conte’s team by defeating Watford 4-1 on Sunday. Pochettino suggested the chasing pack, led by Liverpool, who are six points behind Chelsea in second, will now will the home side to win at White Hart Lane, claiming that when Tottenham were fighting at the top with Leicester, it was their then-rivals who attracted similar goodwill. “Maybe we will feel how Leicester felt last season,” the Spurs manager said when asked whether he expects the likes of Liverpool and Arsenal to be rooting for Tottenham to stop what currently seems an irresistible force – Chelsea made it 13 wins in a row with a 4-2 triumph over Stoke on Saturday. “It was all the teams with them and against us. Maybe [Chelsea] will feel the same as us last season.” It is not an outlandish thought that a Tottenham win would bring them back into contention, such is their current level of performance, but Pochettino was keen to point out that the division as a whole might benefit from Chelsea’s winning run coming to an end. “Chelsea arrive in a very good shape, we too, and it will be a very tough game but a great opportunity for us to try and stop them and reduce the gap,” he said. “I think it is important for the Premier League and for us that we try and win. Then our challenge is to be in the top four.” The latter, at least, is reality at present and Pochettino was delighted with the performance that took Tottenham above Manchester City on goal difference. Two goals apiece from Harry Kane and Dele Alli saw Spurs record a fourth successive victory. “I think it was nearly a perfect game,” said Pochettino. “The shame was that we conceded a goal in the last minute but there were a lot of positive things and I’m very happy. Now we have two or three days to try and prepare in the best way for Chelsea.” Pochettino’s players adapted well to his switch to a three-man defence, a system he has felt comfortable using since the autumn, but he gave no hint that he would approach the Chelsea match – for which Kyle Walker and Jan Vertonghen are available after suspension – similarly. “We’ll see,” he said. “The formation we choose to play is not important – most important is the animation and how we move the ball. Today was a game where, from the outside, we can see the players were enjoying playing football on the pitch. Most important is the idea, the philosophy, and what we want to do with the ball – I think you give too much importance to the shape.”','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/01/mauricio-pochettino-spurs-chelsea-premier-league-white-hart-lane','Mauricio Pochettino reckons everyone else wants Spurs to beat Chelsea',29,'football'),('sport/2017/jan/01/leicester-saracens-premiership-match-report','Manu Tuilagi could not have worse luck if he throttled several black cats. Eight minutes into the sixth match of his latest comeback, he made a typical outside break that it took three tacklers to thwart but lay on the ground clutching his right knee and had to be helped off, little more than 24 hours after the Lions centre had been named in the England squad. His impact in possession was missed by the Tigers, who lacked a focal point in the tightest of matches and slumped to their second home defeat of the campaign. Instead of going to Brighton for a two-day training camp on Sunday night, Tuilagi had another visit to hospital to look forward to and a scan. “At least his groin is fine,” said the Leicester director of rugby, Richard Cockerill, referring to the problem that had played a large part in restricting the midfielder to 38 appearances in four seasons. “He got a bang on the outside of his knee and these things need up to 48 hours. I saw him at half-time: he smiled and I laughed. We crack on, don’t we?” Crack was the word for Leicester, who tried going toe-to-toe with the most obdurate of opponents but tripped themselves up. In a match played in drizzle after a morning of heavy rain, the ball spent much of the time in the air, Ben Spencer, the day after he made England’s elite squad, getting the better of Ben Youngs, not least because of the protection he was given at the breakdown. Spencer had the time to hang his kicks and give his chasers every opportunity of either catching the ball or hitting the defender who had taken possession. Meanwhile Youngs was rushed into decisions by Maro Itoje, who capped another eye-catching performance by making an unusual charge-down, sliding in football style after Owen Williams had kicked with his left foot and getting the ball rather than his opponent’s ankle. Leicester achieved a surprising measure of dominance up front, Ellis Genge, looking to give the watching Eddie Jones a nudge after the head coach left him out of the national squad, and Dan Cole winning a succession of penalties in the scrum. But so convincingly had Saracens won the kicking game that only two were within the kicking range of Owen Williams. It was from a kick that Saracens scored the only try of the game after 54 minutes, seconds after Williams had hooked a 35-metre penalty that would have put the Tigers 12-6 ahead. As Leicester looked to play the ball on their own 10-metre line, Rhodes again showed his nuisance value and Youngs had not got the ball firmly in his grasp when he looped a pass to&nbsp;Williams. As the fly-half tried to take the ball above his head he was unnerved by the looming presence of Brad Barritt, who seized possession and set up a ruck. Saracens went left, where Owen Farrell used the threat of the 22st Will Skelton outside him to commit Mike Williams to cover the second row. That created a hole which Cole, standing inside Farrell, was never going to fill and the outside-half ran in from 30 metres for the score that came to be decisive. When Leicester’s moment came 13 minutes from time, they lacked the same calculation. Barritt’s chip just inside Leicester’s half was blocked by Jack Roberts and Tuilagi’s replacement Tom Brady carried the ball into Saracens’ 22 where, tackled by Alex Goode, he passed to Roberts outside him. The timing was wrong and Barritt tracked back to make up for his mistake. The two incidents marked a crucial difference between the sides and, while it was Saracens’ first league win here since 2013, Leicester have won only four of the last 17 Premiership meetings with the champions. Sarries closed the gap with the leaders, Wasps, to one point with a victory that was achieved without the Vunipola brothers and the England second-row George Kruis, who is unlikely to play again this month after suffering a broken cheekbone but is expected to be fit for the start of the Six Nations. Sarries’ kicking game helped compensate for the drop in rushing metres in the absence of the Vunipolas on a day when territory was king. Leicester took the lead on 10 minutes with the first of Williams’ four penalties but he missed two others, including one from just wide of the posts at the end of the first half when Leicester had for the only time in the match made their scrum dominance count near their opponents’ line. Cockerill reached for the word hindsight when asked if another scrum and with it the prospect of a penalty try would have been the better option, but Saracens, who lost Chris Ashton to a head injury in the second half, would still have found a way to win. The Tigers have been able for the most part to mask their shortcomings at home this season after being exposed away which is why the latest loss of Tuilagi is so cruel. He was in full flow, leaving Farrell grasping air and Marcelo Bosch hanging on grimly when Sean Maitland clattered the centre from behind and caught his right knee. Accidents happen to Tuilagi more often than most and England again look like having to prepare for a tournament without him.

Morocco – Three Moroccans were wounded, the MAP news agency quoted the embassy in Ankara as saying. Hello, Nicola Slawson here in London, taking over from Jamie. Here’s an update from our correspondent, Kareem Shaheen, in Istanbul: One important question that has been raised is how the assailant managed to escape even though the police response was quite swift to the attack, since there is a police station just across the street from Reina. There are over 300 security cameras in the club and the surrounding area so investigators are combing through security cam footage. One theory, believed by some who have seen some of the footage, is that the attacker, who left his gun at the scene, may have pretended to be an injured civilian in the immediate aftermath and chaos. A manhunt is on for an attacker who shot dead 39 people and wounded 69 others during a New Year’s Eve celebration at an upmarket Istanbul nightclub. Turkish officials said it was a lone gunman but some survivors described seeing multiple attackers. A Turkish opposition MP said at least 24 of those killed were foreign nationals, higher than the 15 cited by Turkish interior minister Suleyman Soylu. CHP MP said 11 Turks, seven Saudi Arabians, three Iraqis, two Lebanese, two Tunisian, two Indian and a Kuwaiti, a Syrian, and an Israelis are among the dead. A Belgian citizen who is originally Turkish, and a Canadian-Iraqi were also killed, she said. The Jordanian foreign ministry said three of its citizens were killed. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack on the Reina club,which is thought to have had up to 600 people inside at the time. The club is an exclusive hotspot popular with tourists and local residents that sits on the bank of the eastern side of the Bosphorus. President Tayyip Erdoğan said Turkey would “fight to the end” against all forms of terrorism. He accused the perpetrators of trying to “create chaos, demoralise our people, and destabilise our country”. Witnesses reported a rush for the exits, bodies lying on the floor and people jumping into the water to escape the gunman. One survivor said the gunman shouted “Allahu Akbar” (God is greatest) during the attack. There has been condemnation from across the world with the US State Department describing it as “heinous” and Barack Obama offering his condolences. The Russian president Vladimir Putin said it was “hard to imagine a more cynical crime” and Pope Francis said he was praying for the victims. Leanne Nasser, 19, from the Israeli-Arab town of Tira Nasser was killed while celebrating with three friends. Her friend Ruaa Mansour, also 18, was moderately wounded in the attack. The other two friends were unharmed. A Lebanese man, Haykal Musallem, was at the club with his wife of five months when he was killed, a friend said. A security guard at the club, Fatih Çakmak, Turkish police officer, Burak Yildiz, 22, and 47-year-old travel agent Ayhan Arik, were also reportedly killed. Çakmak reportedly survived twin bombings outside a football stadium in Istanbul on 10 December, which killed 45 people. Mehmet Görmez, Turkey’s most senior cleric, has condemned the attack as “savagery” and a “massacre that no Muslim conscience can accept”. Conservative politicians and media who criticised the concept of New Year celebrations have come under scrutiny in the wake of the attack. An opposition politician called for those responsible for “messages which can damage our social peace” to resign. France’s foreign minister says one French citizen was killed and three others wounded in the New Year’s shooting attack at a crowded Istanbul nightclub, AP reports. Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said in a statement that a woman with both French and Tunisian citizenship died in the attack early Sunday. Ayrault says the woman’s Tunisian husband also died. Due to the presence of French citizens among the casualties, the Paris prosecutor’s office says it has opened a criminal investigation for “terrorist murders and attempted murders.” An assailant opened fire at the Reina nightclub during New Year’s celebrations, killing at least 39 people. Turkish authorities said foreigners from “many different nationalities” are among the wounded in the attack. French President Francois Hollande says in a statement that France “will pitilessly pursue the fight” against terrorism with its allies. Hi, Jamie Grierson in London here, taking over from Haroon. Here’s some updated advice from the UK’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). A brief statement on the department’s website reads: On 1 January 2017, there was an attack on the Reina nightclub in Ortakoy, Istanbul, causing a large number of casualties. There is an ongoing police operation in Istanbul as a result of the attack, and the attacker may still be at large. You should exercise vigilance and caution at this time, and follow the advice and instructions of the security authorities. Charbel Wardini, from Lebanon, told AP that his 26-year-old brother, Elias, was among those killed in the attack. He said: I lost my brother because of terrorism. If you tell me terrorism, I will go fight against them. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said seven Lebanese were wounded in the attack. Lebanon’s foreign ministry reported earlier that the daughter of member of parliament Estephan El Douaihy was among those injured. The Lebanese government plans to send a jet to Istanbul on Sunday night with a medical team and relatives of the wounded in order to bring them back to Beirut. The foreign ministry in Amman has said three Jordanians were killed and four injured, the official Petra news agency reported. At the forensic institute in Istanbul, Kareem Shaheen spoke to Stephanie Deek, a Lebanese woman whose friend was with her husband, Haykal Musallem, at Reina when the attack happened. Musallem was killed. Deek said: They were just tourists, married for five months, and they wanted to find the perfect place to spend New Year’s Eve. She said when the attack happened the husband was in the bathroom and the wife at the table. She ran out when the shooting started but the husband was caught in the midst of the attack and died. Deek tried to contact them as soon as she heard of the attack, and was there to try and identify the body but had to wait outside and was visibly agitated. She said: I’m feeling so sad. I can’t even talk or express my feelings. Selina Dogan, a CHP [the main opposition party] MP who toured the hospitals and the morgue, said 11 Turks, 24 foreign nationals and four whose nationality has yet to be ascertained were killed in the attack. She said the nationalities of the dead included Saudi Arabian (seven) Iraqi (three), Lebanese (two), Tunisian (two) Indian (two) and one each from Kuwait, Syria, and Israel. A Belgian citizen who is originally Turkish, and a Canadian-Iraqi were also killed. One of the Kuwaiti wounded told visitors that the assailant was shouting “Allahu Akbar” (God is greatest). The survivors they spoke to all said there were multiple assailants, although Turkish authorities have said there was a lone attacker, and some said they were in contact with each other on walkie talkies. All of the dead had gun wounds caused by a Kalashnikov assault rifle. Of the dead, 25 are men and 14 women. Eleven bodies have already been handed over to their families for burial. Two of the dead are believed to be Saudi twins but they haven’t been formally identified yet. Five Saudi citizens were killed in the attack and 10 more injured, according to the al-Riyhadh website (Arabic link), quoting the country’s acting consul general in Istanbul. Another Lebanese man, Haykal Mousallem, was killed in the attack, his relatives have told Reuters. Earlier, the family of Elias Wardini told Lebanon’s New TV that they had been officially informed of his death. Lebanon’s National News Agency said several other Lebanese nationals were wounded in the attack. Turkish media say the victims of the attack include a police officer and a travel agent, AP reports. State-run Anadolu news agency reported that the body of 22-year-old police officer Burak Yildiz was en route to his hometown in the southern city of Mersin. Yildiz, who had been on the force for one-and-a-half years, was shot and killed outside the Reina nightclub. Private Dogan news agency reports that 47-year-old travel agent Ayhan Arik, a father of two, was another of the first victims of the early morning attack. The news agency says the gunman shot Arik in the head outside the club. The Turkish prime minister has also said the reports that the attacker was dressed as Santa Claus are untrue. Turkish authorities are starting to uncover evidence about the attack on the Reina nightclub but there is no clarity yet on who was responsible, Turkish prime minister Binali Yildirim said. When asked by reporters who might have been behind it, he answered: Some details have started emerging, but the authorities are working towards a concrete result. Police and security officials will share information as it becomes available during the investigation. Israeli, Lebanese, Libyan, Moroccan, and Saudi Arabian citizens were among 39 people killed when a gunman opened fire in an Istanbul nightclub during a New Year’s Eve celebration, Turkish authorities said. Another 69 people were injured. At least 15 of the dead are believed to be foreign nationals. Interior minister Süleyman Soylu said that the gunman was still on the run, contrary to earlier statements by authorities that the assailant had been killed. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack on the Reina club, which is thought to have had up to 600 people inside at the time. The club is an exclusive hotspot popular with tourists and local residents that sits on the bank of the western side of the Bosphorus. President Tayyip Erdoğan said Turkey would “fight to the end” against all forms of terrorism. He accused the perpetrators of trying to “create chaos, demoralise our people, and destabilise our country”. The city’s governor, Vasip Sahin, said the attacker, armed with a long-barrelled weapon, killed a policeman and a civilian outside the Reina club at about 1.45am before moving inside. Video footage showed an apparent assailant dressed in black, in contradiction to a report suggesting he was wearing a Santa Claus costume. Witnesses reported a rush for the exits, bodies lying on the floor and people jumping into the water to escape the gunman. The club’s owner said extra security measures had been brought in in the past 10 days after US intelligence reports suggested a possible attack on crowded places in the city. There has been condemnation from across the world with the US State Department describing it as “heinous” and Barack Obama offering his condolences. The Russian president Vladimir Putin said it was “hard to imagine a more cynical crime” and Pope Francis said he was praying for the victims. Leanne Nasser, 19, from the Israeli-Arab town of Tira Nasser was killed while celebrating with three friends. Her friend Ruaa Mansour, also 18, was moderately wounded in the attack. The other two friends were unharmed. Mehmet Görmez, Turkey’s most senior cleric, has condemned the attack as “savagery” and a “massacre that no Muslim conscience can accept”. Conservative politicians and media who criticised the concept of New Year celebrations have come under scrutiny in the wake of the attack. An opposition politician called for those responsible for “messages which can damage our social peace” to resign. The family of a Lebanese citizen who went missing after an attack in a nightclub in Istanbul said they have received news he was among those killed, Lebanon’s New TV reported. The channel said the family had been officially informed of Elias Wardini’s death. These pictures show flowers left at the scene of the attack. Some of the marginal newspapers with a very conservative following like Akit and Milli Gazete published front page features yesterday on NYE celebrations. In Milli the headline was: “This is the last warning, don’t celebrate”. In Akit, the front page said “Down with your civilisation”, with pictures side by side of people in Syria and people partying. An influential CHP deputy from Istanbul, Gursel Tekin, said at the hospital: In the coming days we should be talking about this - in the last week there were so many messages which can damage our social peace but none of these messages were investigated. Those responsible should resign. This is a list of terrorist attacks in Turkey since the summer of 2015, via the New York Times: This is the scene at Sisli Etfal hospital where wounded and survivors were taken last night. There are few families as the nightclub is a known destination for foreigners, so many of the casualties do nOt have family here. Many roads in the city are closed off as they search for the attackers. There are two foreigners at the hospital who are wounded and in a critical condition. There is also a wounded Turkish man who was shot in his spine and is getting psychological support and treatment. Opposition CHP lawmaker Akif Hamzacebe described the assault as an “attack on a way of life” and and said it was “savage”. “The aim is to plant seeds of hatred among society,” he said. “We do not want to live with the acceptance of terror and the state should teach a lesson to the terrorist organisations.” It is important to note that many conservatives prior to the attack were decrying the sinfulness of NYE celebrations and so some people see the attack as notable from a cultural point of view, hence the comment about it being an attack on a way of life, almost an attack on Turkey’s secular character. An MHP lawmaker who visited the hospital described the dead as “martyrs”. “Those who committed this action against the stability of the Turkish state will drown in their own blood,” he said. The Reina nightclub has long been a magnet to the rich and famous, my colleague Robert Booth writes: Open since 2002, the venue on the banks of the Bosphorus has earned a reputation as the place to be seen among Turkey’s young, secular elite who recline on its white banquettes and are served ice buckets of drinks by aproned waiters. It attracts footballers from the top Turkish sides and stars from the country’s popular soap operas, as well as tourists and businesspeople from around the world. Daniel Craig, Kylie Minogue, Naomi Watts and Jon Bon Jovi are among the celebrities named as having been guests at the club, according to GC Prive, a London wealth management company that recommends the venue to its clients. The funeral of Ayhan Arik, one of the victims of the attack at the Reina nightclub, has been taking place in Istanbul. Arik reportedly drove tourists to the club. Islamic custom is to bury people as soon as possible after their death. This video shows bullets ricocheting outside the Reina nightclub and a man who appears to be the attacker. It suggests that reports that the attacker was wearing a Santa Claus suit are wrong, as he appears to be dressed all in black. A number of people have said that the attack on the nightclub came amid criticism in Turkey of New Year’s celebrations from some who consider them incompatible with Islam. In his traditional New Year address, Pope Francis has urged leaders to work together to fight the “plague of terrorism” in the wake of events in Turkey. Speaking to 50,000 people in St. Peter’s Square, Francis departed from his prepared text to condemn the Istanbul nightclub attack that killed at least 39 people. He said: Unfortunately, violence has stricken even in this night of good wishes and hope. Pained, I express my closeness to the Turkish people. I pray for the many victims and for the wounded and for the entire nation in mourning. I ask the Lord to sustain all men of good will to courageously roll up their sleeves to confront the plague of terrorism and this stain of blood that is covering the world with a shadow of fear and a sense of loss. The pro-Kurdish HDP, Turkey’s third largest party, has condemned the Istanbul attack: The US embassy in Turkey has sought to clarify the details of a travel warning it issued on 22 December, saying “it had no information about threats to specific entertainment venues, including the Reina club”, despite social media rumours to the contrary. Turkey’s top cleric has said there is no difference between a terrorist attack on a “place of worship or in an entertainment place”. The Turkish family minister has said that Saudi Arabian, Moroccan, Lebanese and Libyan nationals were also among the victims of the attack The Israeli foreign ministry has said that an Israeli woman was killed in the attack. She is Leanne Nasser, 19, from the Israeli-Arab town of Tira. Nasser was celebrating with three friends at the Reina nightclub when the gunman broke in and opened fire. Her friend Ruaa Mansour, also 18, was moderately wounded in the attack. The other two friends were unharmed. The president of the European Commission has sent his condolences to Turkey. The UK government has updated its travel advice for Turkey in the wake of the attack. It says: On 1 January 2017, there was an attack on the Reina nightclub in Ortakoy, Istanbul, causing a large number of casualties. There is an ongoing police operation in Istanbul as a result of the attack, and the attacker may still be at large. You should exercise vigilance and caution at this time, and follow the advice and instructions of the security authorities. Turkish website the Daily Sabah reports that a man killed in the attack at Reina nightclub had survived twin bombings outside a football stadium in Istanbul on 10 December, which killed 45 people. It says that Fatih Çakmak was on duty at the nightclub during the New Year celebrations and was also working at the match between Beşiktaş and Bursaspor last month. He escaped the bombing, which occurred after the match ended, unharmed, according to the Daily Sabah only to die in last night’s attack. Human Rights Watch executive director Kenneth Roth has tweeted a map showing the number of deaths from terrorist attacks in Turkey over the past 18 months (Istanbul is in the north-west corner): Unsurprisingly, there is still a heavy police presence at the scene of the atrocity. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has joined in the international condemnation of the attack in Turkey. He said: “It is hard to imagine a more cynical crime than the murder of innocent civilians in the midst of New Year’s holiday. But the terrorists are absolutely alien to the concept of human morality. Our common duty is to respond decisively to the terrorist aggression.” President Tayyip Erdoğan has vowed not to rest in the fight against all forms of terrorism. In a written statement, he said: “As a nation, we will fight to the end against not just the armed attacks of terror groups and the forces behind them, but also against their economic, political and social attacks. They are trying to create chaos, demoralise our people, and destabilise our country with abominable attacks which target civilians ... We will retain our cool-headedness as a nation, standing more closely together, and we will never give ground to such dirty games.” There has been condemnation of the attack from around the world. This is from the UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, who has Turkish ancestry but has lampooned President Erdoğan in the past The foreign ministry of neighbouring Greece said: We unequivocally condemn the barbaric terrorist attack with numerous casualties that occurred in the nightclub in Istanbul. We express our full solidarity with the Turkish people and convey heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims and wishes of a speedy recovery to the injured. And this is from Israel, which has already said that an Israeli woman was injured in the attack and that another is missing. I am going to hand over the blog now to my colleague, Haroon Siddique. Many thanks to our readers and I hope the blog has proved useful. There are still many details yet to emerge about the motivation behind the attack, the whereabouts of the assailant(s) and of course the details of the victims. Below is a full report of where things stand at the moment. Mehmet Dag, 22, was passing by the club at the time of the shooting. He says he saw the suspect shoot at a police officer and a bystander outside, before going in. “I was in shock at the scene,” he said. “Once he went in, we don’t know what happened. There were gun sounds and after two minutes, the sound of an explosion.” Israel’s foreign ministry has said that an Israeli woman was injured in the attack, and that another is missing. “An Israeli woman was injured and hospitalised, but her life is not in danger, while there is no news of a second Israeli woman who was in the nightclub at the time of the attack,” a ministry spokesman told AFP. Turkey is a popular tourist destination for Israelis, with tens of thousands visiting each year. At least 39 people have been killed, and 69 injured, in an Istanbul nightclub after a gunman reportedly dressed as Father Christmas entered and began firing at random during a New Year’s Eve celebration. Interior minister Süleyman Soylu said that of 21 victims identified so far, 15 were foreign nationals. Soylu said the gunman was still on the run, contrary to earlier statements by authorities that the assailant had been killed. The city’s governor, Vasip Sahin, said the attacker, armed with a long-barrelled weapon, killed a policeman and a civilian outside the Reina club at about 1.45am before moving inside. Sahin described it as a “terror attack” but gave no further details. There have not yet been any claims of responsibility. It is thought up to 600 people were inside the club, an exclusive hotspot popular with tourists and local residents that sits on the bank of the eastern side of the Bosphorus. Witnesses reported a rush for the exits, bodies lying on the floor and people jumping into the water to escape the gunman. The club’s owner said extra security measures had been brought in in the past 10 days after US intelligence reports suggested a possible attack. Security has been increased across the city following the mass shooting in the district of Ortakoy. The US embassy has told its citizens to avoid the area and urged them to contact relatives to let them know they are safe. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has been quoted by state-run news agency Anadolu as expressing his “deep sadness”. Mehmet Görmez, Turkey’s most senior cleric, has condemned the attack as “savagery” and a “massacre that no Muslim conscience can accept”. Mehmet Görmez, Turkey’s most senior cleric, has condemned the attack as “savagery, horrendous”. “The action is a murder and a massacre,” he said. “Terror can never be accepted no matter by who or against whom it is committed.” The only nuance, which differentiates the terrorist action committed tonight from others, is that it aims to divide the nation and confront people from differnet lifestyles by inciting them. Today is the day to unite as the whole national against any kind of terror. I strongly condemn the terrorists who committed this massacre that no Muslim conscience can accept. I wish mercy from Allah for the ones who lost their lives in the attack and speedy recovery for the injured. Justice minister Bekir Bozdağ issued a statement earlier, saying: “No terrorist attack will break our unity.” Koçarslan also mentions that the attacker was using “Kalashnikovs”. This would support other witness accounts that the gunman was using multiple weapons. It is also the first detail that has emerged about the type of firearm used, other than Istanbul governor Vasip Sahin’s reference to the use of “a long-barrelled weapon”. Turkish newspaper Hürriyet has quoted Mehmet Koçarslan, the owner of the Reina nightclub where the attack took place, as saying security measures had been brought in over the past 10 days after US intelligence reports suggested a possible attack. A bit more background on Istanbul’s Reina club. The place is popular with Turkey’s young, secular elite and is one of the most prestigious nightspots in the city. It is situated on the shores of the Bosphorus on the European side of the city and has a terrace that goes down to the water’s edge. The most wealthy patrons arrive in boats to enjoy its several restaurants and dancefloors. Its parties are well known on the social circuit. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has issued his condolences. The US state department made in its response earlier a specific reference to Turkey as “our Nato ally” in the fight against terrorism. The health minister, Recep Akdağ, has also spoken, indicating four of the 69 injured are in a “very serious condition” and that the wounded also included several foreigners. Turkey’s interior minister has lowered the number of foreign nationals killed to 15. However, it is worth noting that there are still more than a dozen victims who have yet to be identified. AP quotes Süleyman Soylu as saying of the five Turkish fatalities identified so far, three or four were believed to be employees working at the club. He says: This was a massacre, a truly inhuman savagery. He said it was believed the attacker left the club wearing different clothing to those in which he entered the club. It has been reported the attacker was wearing a Father Christmas outfit. Soylu said the attacker was believed to have been acting alone. Previous witness reports have suggested there might have been more than one attacker. Authorities earlier said the gunman was killed on site, so details remain unclear, about eight hours after the attack took place. The UK’s Foreign Commonwealth Office and Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have said they are working to determine if any of their citizens are involved in Sunday morning’s attack. At least 39 people have been killed, and 69 injured, in an Istanbul nightclub after a gunman reportedly dressed as Father Christmas entered and began firing at random during a New Year’s Eve celebration. Interior minister Süleyman Soylu said that of 21 victims identified so far, 16 were foreign nationals. Soylu said the gunman was still on the run, contrary to earlier statements by authorities that the gunman had been killed. The city’s governor, Vasip Sahin, said the attacker, armed with a long-barrelled weapon, killed a policeman and a civilian outside the Reina club at about 1.45am before moving inside. Sahin described it as a “terror attack” but gave no further details. There have not yet been any claims of responsibility. It is thought up to 600 people were inside the club, an exclusive hotspot popular with tourists and local residents that sits on the bank of the eastern side of the Bosphorus. Witnesses reported a rush for the exits, bodies lying on the floor and people jumping into the water to escape the gunman. Security has been increased across the city following the attack in the district of Ortakoy. The US embassy has told its citizens to avoid the area and urged them to contact relatives to let them know they are safe. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has been quoted by state-run news agency Anadolu as expressing his “deep sadness” over the attack More quotes have come through from the interior minister, Süleyman Soylu: Our security forces have started the necessary operations. God willing he will be caught in a short period of time. Some images have come through giving a view from the Bosphorus on to the Reina nightclub, inside which security officers can be seen. Soylu gave the figure of 16 foreigners dead after only 21 victims were identified. This means the nationalities of 18 more victims are yet to be established. The interior minister, Süleyman Soylu, has said the attacker is still on the loose. Earlier government reports stated there was a lone gunman who was killed by police. Soylu said the death toll was now at 39, with 16 of those being foreign nationals. He did not provide any information on their countries. A further 69 people are being treated in hospitals across the city. Agence France-Presse is reporting comments from the interior minister, saying that the death toll has risen to 39, including 16 foreigners. Professional footballer Sefa Boydas has told AFP how people fainted after they heard gunshots while others walked on top of people to escape the attack. Boydas, who plays for Istanbul club Beylerbeyi SK, said he had only been in the club for about 10 minutes with two friends before he heard gunshots and his friend collapsed in shock. Just as we were settling down, by the door there was a lot of dust and smoke. Gunshots rang out. When those sounds were heard, many girls fainted. He said people appeared to be crushed as they ran away. They say 35 to 40 died but it’s probably more because when I was walking, people were walking on top of people.” He described the screams which he said drowned out anything said by the attacker or attackers. He uses the word “they”, which could support the notion that there was more than one assailant. Even if there were shouting, you wouldn’t hear because the crowd’s screams were 100 times louder.” Boydas initially tried to escape holding his friend but upon seeing her older sister faint, the footballer said his friend also passed out. Our Middle East reporter Kareem Shaheen has filed this report from Istanbul. He notes it is still unclear how many assailants were involved. While the authorities said one gunman entered the club and was later killed by police, witness testimony in Turkish media appeared to describe more than one attacker, heightening fears that at least one other gunman remained on the loose. At least 35 people have been killed, and about 40 injured, in an Istanbul nightclub after a gunman reportedly dressed as Santa Claus entered and began firing at random during a New Year’s Eve celebration The city’s governor, Vasip Sahin, said the attacker, armed with a long-barrelled weapon, killed a policeman and a civilian outside the Reina club at about 1.45am before moving inside. Sahin described it as a “terror attack” but gave no further details. There have not yet been any claims of responsibility. It is thought up to 600 people were inside the club, a hotspot popular with tourists and local residents that sits on the bank of the eastern side of the Bosphorus. Witnesses reported a rush for the exits, bodies lying on the floor and people jumping into the river to escape the gunman, who has been killed, according to a government spokesman. Security has been increased across the city following the attack in the district of Ortakoy. The US embassy has told its citizens to avoid the area and urged them to contact relatives to let them know they are safe. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has been quoted by state-run news agency Anadolu as expressing his “deep sadness” over the attack The US embassy in Turkey has urged US citizens to avoid the area – the district of Ortakoy – in the wake of the attack. It said in a statement: “We strongly urge US citizens in Turkey to directly contact concerned family members in the United States to advise them of your safety.” It is worth noting the club is popular with tourists as well as local residents. There is no word as yet on the nationalities of those who have been killed, or indeed an exact death toll. The BBC is reporting a media blackout has been ordered by the Turkish government for security reasons. Security measures had been heightened in major Turkish cities during what has been a year marked by terrorist attacks. In Istanbul, 17,000 police officers were on duty during this week’s festive celebrations. Some were camouflaged as Santa Claus and others as street vendors, state news agency Anadolu reported. The state-run Anadolu news agency has quoted the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, as expressing his “deep sadness” over the attack. He is getting regular updates on the investigation and the casualties from the prime minister, Binali Yıldırım. Kareem Shaheen is reporting a huge security presence in the districts surrounding Ortakoy, where the attack took place. Many roads have been closed off. The hugely popular Istiklal avenue – a pedestrianised area packed with shops, bars and cafes – is lined with many police cars and armed officers. The coast guard patrols the Bosphorus near the river frontage of the Reina nightclub. There were reports of partygoers jumping into the river to escape the gunman. Witness Sinem Uyanik has recounted her ordeal. She was inside the club and her husband, Lutfu Uyanik, was wounded in the attack. “Before I could understand what was happening, my husband fell on top me,” she said outside Istanbul’s Sisli hospital. “I had to lift several bodies from on top of me before I could get out.” Turkey has been hit by a string of attacks in recent months, blamed on Kurdish militants and Islamic State jihadists. On December 10, 44 people were killed in a double bombing in Istanbul after a football match hosted by top side Besiktas. That attack, which targeted a police bus, was claimed by the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons (TAK) seen as a radical offshoot of the PKK. A week later, 14 Turkish soldiers were killed and dozens more wounded in a suicide car bombing blamed on Kurdish militants targeting off-duty conscripts also claimed by the TAK. In June, 47 people were killed in a triple suicide bombing and gun attack at Istanbul’s Ataturk airport, with authorities blaming Isis. Another 57 people, 34 of them children, were killed in August in a suicide attack by an Isis-linked bomber at a Kurdish wedding in the southeastern city of Gaziantep. The US state department has strongly condemned the attack. Deputy spokesman Mark Toner said: “We stand in solidarity with our Nato ally Turkey in combating the ongoing threat of terrorism. Sadly, this heinous attack is only the latest effort to kill and maim innocent civilians. These attacks only reinforce our determination to work with the government of Turkey to counter the scourge of terrorism.” US president Barack Obama, who is on holiday Hawaii, has expressed his condolences and offered help to Turkish authorities. White House spokesman Eric Schultz said in a statement: “The president expressed condolences for the innocent lives lost, directed his team to offer appropriate assistance to the Turkish authorities, as necessary, and keep him updated as warranted.” Government officials have said there was one attacker and that he has been killed. Our reporter says police can be seen leaving the scene now, and emergency services activity is beginning to subside, which might suggest the immediate threat is over. Here is an image from 2015 of the Reina club, where the shooting took place. NTV television is reporting the assailant may still be inside the nightclub. This is an unconfirmed report. Armed police in riot gear, backed up by armoured vehicle, have sealed off the area. As many as 600 people were thought to have been in the club when the attack happened, at about 1.15am, broadcaster CNN Turk has reported. Some people jumped into the waters of the Bosphorus to escape and were being rescued by police. Istanbul’s governor, Vasip Sahin, told reporters at the scene: “A terrorist with a long-range weapon ... brutally and savagely carried out this incident by firing bullets on innocent people who were there solely to celebrate the New Year and have fun.” Kareem has spoken to a witness who was inside the club at the time. He described the rush for the exits after someone came in and began firing multiple firearms. A brother of one of the workers inside Reina is waiting outside in the rain with his wife for any news. His brother lost his phone and they have been unable so far to get in touch. We hope he is fine. My sister called me with the news that there was an attack and we put on our clothes and rushed here. It was really hard because no taxis wanted to go here. Police arrived almost instantaneously after the attack began because the police station is just across the road from the club. The Reina is one of Istanbul’s best-known clubs, situated on the Bosphorus right under one of the bridges linking the European and Asian sides. Footage has emerged that reportedly shows the assailant dressed as Santa. Details however are still far from clear. Earlier reports said there were two attackers. Witnesses are in the police station giving testimony at the moment so more details should soon emerge. It is just coming up to 4.30am in Istanbul. Our Middle East reporter, Kareem Shaheen, is at the scene of the attack. Police have sealed off the roads around the site as families arrive, seeking news of loved ones who were working at the club or visiting. There are a lot of tears. One woman rushed here because her nephew works as a bartender at the Reina club. She has finally just reached him on the phone. At least 35 people have been killed in a gun attack at a nightclub in Istanbul, the city’s governor has said. Vasip Sahin said 40 other people were wounded in the assault which took place in the early hours of Sunday during a New Year’s Eve celebration. Sahin said the incident was a “terror attack” without saying who might have carried it out. The assailant shot a police officer and a civilian as he entered the club in the Ortakoy district before opening fire inside the building, Sahin said. There are many details that are still unclear, we will bring your further details as they come to light.','https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2017/jan/01/istanbul-nightclub-attack-dozens-killed-new-years-eve-mass-shooting-live-updates','Istanbul attack: Manhunt for attacker who killed 39 in nightclub – as it happened',31,'world'),('football/2017/jan/01/bournemouth-arsenal-match-preview','Bournemouth brushed aside Swansea City on New Year’s Eve and return to home soil hoping to close out a team at the opposite end of the table, Arsenal.

Much of the UK saw New Year’s Day downpours, but the rain will give way to a frosty start to the year as temperatures fall below zero as far south as the Chiltern Hills, where sleet and snow are possible. Temperatures are set to drop to their lowest point so far this winter, with forecasters predicting a possible -7C (19.4F) in Wales and the Scottish Highlands. Sophie Yeomans, a meteorologist at the Met Office, said: “We’ve got a cold front across the south of the country. The rain should clear, but moving in behind that we have a lot of cold air coming from the north. It’s going to be very frosty at night and temperatures will drop below zero.” A level two warning has been issued, which lasts until 3pm on Tuesday. Yeomans said: “Cold weather alerts are given to let people know it’s going to be quite cold and they should put the heating on. “There is also a yellow warning for across the north, Scotland and parts of Northern Ireland, which is to warn people about ice that could cause hazardous conditions on the roads.” The lowest temperature for the UK at this time of year was -18.5C, recorded in Braemar, Aberdeenshire, in 1962. The weather is set to warm up slightly later in the week, but Yeomans said temperatures were only likely to rise by a couple of degrees. Public Health England also issued warnings about the upcoming cold spell. People were advised to turn their heating on, keep an eye on elderly neighbours and stay tuned to weather forecasts. Dr Thomas Waite of PHE’s extreme events team said: “Every winter thousands of people die because of their exposure to cold weather, and doctors’ surgeries, hospitals and other parts of the NHS are kept busy as people fall ill. “That’s why it’s really important that we all do everything we can to ensure everyone stays well this winter. The elderly, very young and those with pre-existing health conditions are most at risk during cold weather. “Keeping homes heated to at least 18C is a great way to avoid the health problems from cold, as is stocking up on food and medicine before cold weather sets in and wearing lots of thin layers, instead of fewer thick ones.”','https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/01/icy-weather-to-follow-new-year-downpours','Icy weather to follow new year downpours',33,'uk-news'),('politics/2017/jan/01/tim-farron-theresa-may-new-year-brexit-pledge','Theresa May’s new year message urging unity and pledging to also represent the interests of remainers during negotiations with Brussels are empty words given her previous hardline approach, the Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, has said. In her video message May acknowledged how divisive June’s referendum had been and said both sides would be in her mind as she prepared to trigger article 50. “I am there to get the right deal not just for those who voted to leave, but for every single person in this country,” she said, counter to recent hints that the government is preparing a hard Brexit, which would see the country leave both the customs union and the single market. Farron, whose party is campaigning for a second referendum on any exit deal finalised with the EU, said: “After months of platitudes and driving us headlong towards a hard Brexit out of the single market, threatening jobs and our economic security, a few empty words are utterly meaningless. “If the prime minister cannot even deliver on the words she gave when she campaigned for remain, why should we believe her now? In all of this she has Labour holding her hand, marching towards a disastrous Brexit.” In recent days, leave campaigners have stepped up efforts to push for what they term a “clean break’ with Brussels, with the UK cutting all formal ties with the bloc. In a letter sent to the prime minister, the pressure group Leave Means Leave said leaving the single market and the customs union should be “red lines” for the prime minister. “There must be no transitional deal on the key issues,” the group’s co-chairs Richard Tice and John Longworth wrote. “The EU is renowned for its inability to secure trade deals within a sensible timeframe and the UK must be prepared to walk away and secure trade deals with the rest of the world if the EU fails to agree a deal in this timeframe.”','https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/01/tim-farron-theresa-may-new-year-brexit-pledge','Tim Farron dismisses PM\'s new year Brexit pledge as \'empty words\'',34,'politics'),('sport/2017/jan/01/gloucester-northampton-premiership-match-report','The new year does not always guarantee a fresh start but Northampton may at least feel that their luck is turning. A match they rarely looked like winning was gifted to them when Gloucester’s David Halaifonua was sent to the sin-bin for a deliberate knock-on and the Saints awarded a penalty try seven minutes from time. Stephen Myler could not miss the conversion on his 300th Northampton appearance but for Gloucester, who were leading by six points at the time, it was a bitter pill. Luther Burrell’s pass was heading to the replacement Harry Mallinder who had George North – back from his latest break following a head injury, outside him – but a try was not a certainty as Halaifonua attempted to intercept. Northampton’s director of rugby, Jim Mallinder, felt that the referee, Matt Carley, made the right decision: “We were going to score that. It was a clear overlap so it was the only decision the referee could make.” His opposite number, David Humphreys, however, felt Ben Morgan’s disallowed try, when Gloucester were 9-3 ahead, was more costly. “We’re devastated. It’s frustration, disappointment. We felt like we’ve been on the wrong end of decisions these last couple of weeks. Rather than focusing on the penalty try, Ben Morgan believes he was over the line but unfortunately there were not enough camera-angles to prove it.” Until that point, it had been a match typical of both sides’ seasons. Northampton were at least spirited in defence – Courtney Lawes excelled at second-row – but they were helped by Gloucester’s inability to take advantage of their territory and possession. It was, truth be told, a poor match, not helped by the dreadful conditions which considering the plight of these two sides in recent years, rather aptly left them stuck in the mud. Northampton, though, are up to sixth after back-to-back wins, can enjoy some good fortune after their latest travails with Dylan Hartley and the situation over their handling of North’s head injury, and may move up to fifth if they beat Bristol on Saturday. “I’m very pleased, I think it was a little bit of a dogfight,” added Mallinder. “We want to come down here and scrap for a win so it’s a very positive start, a very happy new year.” North was conspicuous in the first half, only in so far as his white jersey was pristine throughout whereas his team-mates were covered in mud. It was not a day suited to wings but for club and country North is far too often on the periphery. His first touch came after 13 minutes, successfully claiming a high ball, but it was not until the stroke of half-time that he received a pass. Whether it is an inability to get him the ball, or an effect of his series of head injuries, it is a terrible shame. It was during this fixture a little more than three years ago when North produced a devastating burst of power and speed to leave defenders strewn all over the field and set up the Premiership’s try of the season, but he looks a shadow of that player at present, even if the coach was pleased with his contribution. “[He is] really pleased to be back playing. He’s been training well and it’s good to see him out there,” Mallinder said. “Not [a day for wings] in terms of ball in hand and superb attacking rugby. But an important part to play and I thought he was safe in front of the high ball.” Some of the handling on show was dreadful and not all of it can be blamed on the slippery ball, but Matt Kvesic shone for Gloucester in the first half and one thundering tackle on Kieran Brookes just before the half hour stopped Saints a metre short of the line. By that stage Gloucester had converted territorial dominance into only three points with a Billy Burns penalty from the left, but the fly-half added two more before the interval. Eight minutes into the second half Northampton were off the mark with a penalty for Myler in front of the posts. Gloucester responded and after their forwards had laid siege to the Northampton line the home side thought they had scored through Morgan in the left-hand corner only for replays to prove inconclusive. Myler then exchanged penalties with Burns but more handling errors let Gloucester down as they sought the try to put the match to bed. They could not find it and after a brief period of pressure from Northampton, Halaifonua digressed, and the match was snatched from Gloucester’s grasp.

ITV Racing’s impressive roster of talent did not combine to make the powerful, confident first broadcast for which producers must have hoped as the channel ended its 30-year absence from the track but there were enough promising signs to suggest that future efforts will leave this first spin far&nbsp;behind. It was a brave decision to ditch the on-course studio employed by Channel&nbsp;4 and put the main presenters in the middle of the paddock and on balance it still feels like the right call, drawing the viewer right into the atmosphere of the day’s racing. Unfortunately, the atmosphere on New Year’s Day at Cheltenham was sopping wet. “We want to go where the people at the track go,” was the advance word from the editorial team, thinking of the paddock and the betting ring, but that laudable ambition was foiled as almost the entire crowd sought shelter in the racecourse’s sundry bars and bistros. Overhead shots showed that, most unusually, the steps around the famous Cheltenham winner’s enclosure were deserted while ITV’s plucky front men stood alone, huddled under umbrellas. “At least we’ve got a nice day for it,” was the game beginning from Ed Chamberlin, poached from Sky Sports to be ITV’s face of horse racing. He claimed to be with those noted former jockeys Sir Anthony McCoy and Luke Harvey, but that had to be taken on trust at first, their faces obscured by raindrops on camera lenses. “It’s wet, it’s miserable but it’s going to be terrific,” we were assured, a promise backed up by a montage of clips from ITV’s rich racing heritage, making early reference to Nijinsky and Lester Piggott, John Oaksey, Dickie Davies, Arkle and sun-soaked shots of Tattenham Corner. Then, deflatingly, came the first live action, a four-runner novice chase in which the expert commentary of Richard Hoiles was quite hard to hear for the first mile, because of the volume at which hoofbeats from the track were also played. The graphics, which seemed to use up only a portion of the available screen, proved hard to read and not just for this writer, judging by Twitter complaints. And just at the point when viewers may have begun to harbour doubts, Matt Chapman dropped a clanger during his betting ring beat by playing an impromptu game of “hair or no hair” with a bookmaker. Quite why anyone should be interested in what a middle‑aged man keeps under his bobble hat is hard to fathom. Chapman has waited an age for his debut on one of the main channels precisely because he has sometimes extemporised as oddly as this on At The Races, but he is self-aware and ditched some of the wackier stuff in recent years. Surely only an excessive desire to entertain can account for him going immediately off-piste on his ITV debut. He will not have impressed many of those unfamiliar with his work but he will get lots more chances. Hardly any racing broadcasters have his capacity to inform, provoke and engage, and perhaps he will give us a smoother run, now that the air is out of his tyres. As the programme progressed, Chapman fared better despite suffering as badly as John McCririck ever did from the sort of fools who want to shove themselves into an on-air shot. Chapman may eventually need a couple of heavies to keep such folk at bay. The best of this first ITV show was an affectionate portrait of the trainer Jonjo O’Neill, making splendid use of archive film of his glory days in the saddle during the 70s. “You’ve been in racing for 50 years,” the interviewer said. “Sure, I’m only a baby,” O’Neill replied with a smile. On this evidence, features are going to be a very strong point for ITV. Pre-race analysis needs some work but we can doubtless expect better when the quality of racing is stronger than it was here. The show gathered strength. Harvey did well to spot Daryl Jacob’s foot slipping out of his stirrup as the jockey fought a close finish and lost. A camera in the weighing room caught Sam Twiston-Davies’s reaction as he watched his younger brother, Willy, riding his first Cheltenham winner. McCoy had the best line, telling Chamberlin: “In sport, anything’s possible. Who’d have thought of Leicester ruling the Premier League? Or that you’d go from a nice, warm studio working with great pundits in Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher to standing out in the rain at Cheltenham with Luke Harvey and me?” Indeed, there may be some mileage in giving McCoy the role of comedy curmudgeon, a series of surprise winners leading him to grouse that only the weather forecaster had got anything right. There certainly seems to be some creative tension between him and Chapman. “We have survived, just,” Chamberlin concluded. The social media response to his show was by then so varied that one news outlet called it “the most divisive thing since Brexit”. Now that everyone involved has been blooded, it may be a relief to move to the calmer backwaters of ITV4 for two months of low-key jump racing. By the time of the Cheltenham Festival in mid-March, we can all hope to see a more polished performance.','https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/01/itv-racing-stumble-cheltenham-debut-ed-chamberlin-tony-mccoy-horse-racing','ITV Racing team falter at first fence on their Cheltenham debut',36,'sport'),('business/2017/jan/01/robin-hoods-sherwood-forest-faces-fracking-threat','The latest battleground for the future of fracking in Britain looks set to be Sherwood Forest, the legendary home of folk hero Robin Hood and now the target of a seismic survey by Ineos. The chemical multinational, which relocated its headquarters back to the UK last month, appears to have agreed terms with the Forestry commission to start burying charges and spend up to two years using “thumper trucks” or vibroseis machines to search for shale gas. Campaigners have called on the government to block any possible fracking and protect the forest. According to documents obtained under freedom of information request by Friends of the Earth, Ineos could be working within 200 metres of the Major Oak, a 1,000-year old tree that in folklore sheltered Robin Hood and his merry men. Commercial fracking has yet to start in Britain, although Ineos and other firms have obtained licences from the government for shale gas exploration. The technology has been deeply controversial since tests conducted by Cuadrilla in 2011 caused earth tremors near Blackpool, but fracking operations are expected to restart in five wells in Yorkshire and Lancashire later this year. A small protest camp has been established at Kirby Misperton, North Yorkshire, at one of the wells where gas firm Third Energy has been given permission to start fracking. Guy Shrubsole, a Friends of the Earth campaigner, said he expected the move to search for shale gas under Sherwood Forest to become a new rallying point. He said: “I can’t think of anything more iconic in the English mindset to go for. You’d have thought they’d have learnt from the mistakes of some of the other fracking companies to avoid it, but they’ve gone straight for it.” Ineos told the Daily Telegraph that no decision had been made on whether fracking would go ahead under the national nature reserve, adding that “any decision to position a well site will take into account environmental features such as the Major Oak”. The firm’s shale operations director, Tom Pickering, said: “Potentially we in the UK have a huge supply of indigenous gas under our own feet. It would be simply crazy not to explore this natural resource.” However, Friends of the Earth fear that the seismic surveys alone could damage the forest, whose core is a site of special scientific interest, and its wildlife, which include rare bats and other protected species as well as ancient woodland. The Forestry commission has mandated that Ineos plants its charges at least 50 metres away from badgers’ setts and conservation sites. Ineos is a relatively new player in fracking, but was one of the big winners in the governmental handout of exploration licences, winning 21 of 159 awarded a year ago. The firm, founded by Jim Ratcliffe and with 17,000 employees worldwide, was welcomed back to the UK by the government last month as a “vote of confidence in the UK economy”, as it promised a $2bn (£1.6bn) investment in businesses including shale gas. Other moves by Ineos to conduct fracking surveys in Nottinghamshire have been rebuffed. The National Trust refused the firm permission to conduct surveys in Clumber Park, a few miles to the north of the forest.','https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/01/robin-hoods-sherwood-forest-faces-fracking-threat','Robin Hood\'s Sherwood Forest faces fracking threat',37,'business'),('us-news/2017/jan/01/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-russia-hacking-sean-spicer','As Russian diplomats expelled by Barack Obama left the US on Sunday, Donald Trump’s incoming White House spokesman attempted to cast as a diplomatic triumph the president-elect’s controversial response to intelligence community reports that Moscow sought to influence the presidential election. “That’s actually good for our country,” Sean Spicer told ABC’s This Week, referring to Russian president Vladimir Putin’s decision not to pursue immediate retaliation. “So everyone wants to talk about the tweets that he sends, but I want to focus on the action that he’s getting. Donald Trump’s not president yet and he’s getting action, successes and wins both abroad and here at home.” Trump’s decision to praise Putin, question intelligence findings and repeatedly say the US should “move on” places the president-elect at odds not just with the current White House, but with his own party in Congress. On Thursday, Obama ordered the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomatic personnel and the closure of estates in Maryland and New York used by embassy staff. The expelled personnel left Washington on Sunday, Reuters reported, citing a Russian news agency report. “The plane took off, everyone has left,” Reuters quoted the embassy’s press service as saying, from a report in RIA. On Friday, contrary to the view of his foreign ministry, Putin declined to respond to Obama’s move, signalling that he would rather wait to gauge relations with the Trump administration. As is his wont, and to familiar uproar, Trump expressed his approval on Twitter. “Great move on delay (by V. Putin),” he wrote. “I always knew he was very smart!” On Sunday, Spicer, formerly chief strategist and communications director of the Republican National Committee, said Obama’s measures were unlike any “in modern history for any action” and could prove too far-reaching. “I think one of the questions that we have is, why the magnitude of this?” he said. “I mean you look at 35 people being expelled, two sites being closed down, the question is, is that response in proportion to the actions taken?” Spicer and Trump’s comments stand in sharp contrast to views held by Republicans in Congress. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said the White House had “not yet dissuaded [Russia] from attempting to breach our cybersecurity systems, or harass our diplomats in Moscow”. House speaker Paul Ryan called the sanctions “overdue” and “an appropriate way to end eight years of failed policy with Russia”. Leading Republicans have joined calls for a bipartisan congressional investigation. Arizona senator John McCain scheduled a hearing on foreign cyber threats for 5 January, and called senior intelligence officials to testify. On Sunday, speaking in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, McCain said: “We will strongly urge our colleagues toward more meaningful and stronger sanctions against Russia because of their attack on the United States of America.” Spicer also expressed concern that Obama had acted to Trump’s political disadvantage and pointed to what he said was a lack of public response to China’s hacking of the federal government’s network in 2015, breaches that exposed sensitive information belonging to more than 22m federal employees and contractors. “A White House statement wasn’t even issued,” Spicer said. “No action publicly was taken. Nothing, nothing was taken.” He added: “So there is a question about whether there’s a political retribution here versus a diplomatic response.” In his own remarks to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate on Saturday night, Trump again expressed doubt over the US intelligence consensus regarding Russian breaches of Democratic party infrastructure. “I just want them to be sure, because it’s a pretty serious charge,” he said. “If you look at the weapons of mass destruction” – a reference to justification for the invasion of Iraq under George W Bush in 2003 – “that was a disaster, and they were wrong.” Trump, who has long advocated for warmer relations with Russia, pressed his view that the US does not know for sure who was behind the cyber-attacks, which he has suggested could have been carried out by China, another state or “someone sitting on their bed weighing 400lbs”. Asked on Saturday about the reported discovery that Moscow could be behind malware found on a laptop owned by a Vermont electricity utility, Trump questioned the premise. “It could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don’t know so we cannot be sure,” Trump said, adding that more would be revealed on “on Tuesday or Wednesday”. The president-elect is set to meet intelligence officials this week, a meeting to which he agreed after the announcement of the Obama sanctions, despite repeating his wish for the American people to “move on” from the issue. Echoing his vague and much-discussed remarks earlier this week about security in the “age of computer”, he said his 10-year-old could “do anything with a computer”, advocated the use of couriers to transfer information, and said: “I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove.” Responding to Trump’s comments, Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives’ intelligence committee, told ABC the president-elect stood alone in questioning the conclusions of US intelligence agencies. “This is the overwhelming judgment of the intelligence community and, frankly, all of the members of the intelligence committees in Congress, Democrats and Republicans,” Schiff said. “None of us have any question about this. The only one who does, apparently, is Donald Trump.” Schiff warned that Trump would face bipartisan resistance if he tried to lift the Obama sanctions. “The reaction is going to be even more vigorous, I’m convinced, in favor of stronger sanctions against Russia,” Schiff said. “You’re going to see Democrats and Republicans, like McCain and [South Carolina senator Lindsey] Graham and others, come together with a strong [congressional] sanctions package because frankly even though what the administration did was more than symbolic – it was very meaningful – it is not enough to deter Russia.”','https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/01/donald-trump-vladimir-putin-russia-hacking-sean-spicer','Trump spokesman on Russia: president-elect already getting \'wins\' abroad',38,'us-news'),('world/2017/jan/01/john-kerrys-challenge-to-israel-on-a-two-state-solution','One state in which a Jewish government rules the entire territory from the Mediterranean to the Jordan and controls a Palestinian Arab population that equals the number of Jews is not the only option. There could be a single state of all its citizens, controlled by a democratically elected parliament and government in the interests of all its citizens (Kerry accuses Israel of undermining peace hopes, 29 December). This would not be a bizarre arrangement. In fact, all civilised nations apart from Israel are governed in this way. Your Q&amp;A section says that “This would effectively be the end of the Jewish homeland, and thus unacceptable to the vast majority of global Jews and many others.” First, the “Jewish homeland” was formed by taking the land of another people, the Palestinians. And most Jews today, as shown by their distribution around the world, have no need for a Jewish homeland. There is also no evidence to show that a single democratic state covering Israel, the West Bank and Gaza would be unacceptable. There are many Jews in the US and the UK who recognise that an ethnically defined state is an anachronism in the modern world. They see that a state of and for all its citizens is the only just route to peace. Even in Israel itself, where the grip of Judaism on the apparatus of state control is increasingly resented by many secular Jews, there is a growing one-state movement. The time has come to face the facts. The rightwing racists who run Israel in the face of all principles of democracy that apply in the rest of the world have to be removed by democratic means so that Israel and Palestine can be governed as one state in the way their citizens deserve. Karl Sabbagh Author, Palestine: A Personal History • The prime minister was absolutely right to criticise John Kerry’s speech on Israel and settlements (Report, 30 December). First, it is legitimate to question why the US secretary of state found it so important to focus his final days in office on Israel’s settlement policy when so much of the world is in flames, so much of the Middle East is in ruins, and when much of that is a direct result of President Obama’s and Kerry’s failures in office. This selectivity in itself invites criticism on the grounds of a lack of even-handedness. Second, while one may disagree with Israel’s settlement policy (as many in Israel do), to suggest that settlements are the obstacle to peace is plainly wrong. Israel had to fight three wars for survival (1948, 1956 and 1967), long before there was an occupation or settlements. In 1967, Israel’s offer to return the territories, in exchange for peace – an offer embedded into UN resolution 242 – was rejected by the Palestinians and Arabs. In 2000, Israel made generous offers to create a Palestinian state, but this too was rejected, and when Israel implemented a unilateral and complete withdrawal from Gaza (2005), all it got in return was a barrage of rockets. The real impediment to peace and to the two-state solution is that the Palestinians (and many Arabs) refuse to concede Israel’s right to exist. They do not dream of a state alongside Israel, but one in place of Israel. The issues are existential, not territorial. Had it been otherwise, the problem would long have been solved, just as it was when Egypt made peace with Israel in 1979. Joshua Rowe Manchester • Reacting to John Kerry’s assessment that Benjamin Netanyahu’s government is the “most rightwing coalition in Israeli history”, Theresa May’s spokesman said she “thought it was not appropriate to focus … solely on the issue of Israeli settlements” and continued: “The government believes that negotiations will only succeed when they are conducted between the two parties, supported by the international community.” The fly in that ointment is that the present creeping annexation of Palestinian territory, while never-ending “negotiations” continue, suits the Netanyahu government. Without external pressure, such as trade and cultural sanctions on Israel, there is nothing to prevent the latticework that is Palestine from being eaten away to the point where it is as no longer viable as a state. Eddie Dougall Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk • In the international angst over Israel it is surely worth remembering those acts of generosity to beleaguered Jews shown by the international community: the Balfour Declaration of 1917, which “favoured the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people”, followed by its implementation through the state of Israel in 1948. To this neutral observer things started to go wrong only when Israel decided in 1967 that it would no longer accept the borders provided for it 19 years earlier. That seems to have been the key action from which the whole tragedy has ensued. Somehow we need to find a way back to first principles on this matter.

Data and anecdote, backed up by doctors and trade unions, suggest the EU’s most chaotic state is in the midst of a public health meltdown. “In the name of tough fiscal targets, people who might otherwise survive are dying,” said Michalis Giannakos who heads the Panhellenic Federation of Public Hospital Employees. “Our hospitals have become danger zones.” Figures released by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control recently revealed that about 10% of patients in Greece were at risk of developing potentially fatal hospital infections, with an estimated 3,000 deaths attributed to them. The occurrence rate was dramatically higher in intensive care units and neonatal wards, the body said. Although the data referred to outbreaks between 2011 and 2012 – the last official figures available – Giannakos said the problem had only got worse. Like other medics who have worked in the Greek national health system since its establishment in 1983, the union chief blamed lack of personnel, inadequate sanitation and absence of cleaning products for the problems. Cutbacks had been exacerbated by overuse of antibiotics, he said. “For every 40 patients there is just one nurse,” he said, mentioning the case of an otherwise healthy woman who died last month after a routine leg operation in a public hospital on Zakynthos. “Cuts are such that even in intensive care units we have lost 150 beds.” “Frequently, patients are placed on beds that have not been disinfected. Staff are so overworked they don’t have time to wash their hands and often there is no antiseptic soap anyway.” No other sector has been affected to the same extent by Greece’s economic crisis. Bloated, profligate and corrupt, for many healthcare was indicative of all that was wrong with the country and, as such, badly in need of reform. Acknowledging the shortfalls, the government announced last month that it planned to appoint more than 8,000 doctors and nurses in 2017. Since 2009, per capita spending on public health has been cut by nearly a third – more than €5bn (£4.3bn) – according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. By 2014, public expenditure had fallen to 4.7% of GDP, from a pre-crisis high of 9.9%. More than 25,000 staff have been laid off, with supplies so scarce that hospitals often run out of medicines, gloves, gauze and sheets. In early December Giannakos, a nurse by training, led a protest march, which started at the grimy building housing the health ministry and ended outside the neoclassical office of the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras. At the ministry, hospital technicians erected a breeze-block wall and from it hung a placard with the words: “The ministry has moved to Brussels.” Few advanced western economies have enacted fiscal adjustment on the scale of Greece. In the six years since it received the first of three bailouts to keep bankruptcy at bay, the country has enforced draconian belt-tightening in return for more than €300bn in emergency loans. The loss of more than 25% of national output – and a recession that has seen ever more people resorting to primary health care – has compounded the corrosive effects of cuts that in the case of public hospitals have often been as indiscriminate as they are deep. Pressure to meet creditor-mandated budget targets means that in 2016 alone, expenditure on the sector has declined by €350m under the stewardship of Syriza, the leftist party that had once railed against austerity, said Giannakos, citing government figures. More than 2.5 million Greeks have been left without any healthcare coverage. Shortages of spare parts are such that scanning machines and other sophisticated diagnostic equipment have become increasingly faulty. Basic blood tests are no longer conducted at most hospitals because laboratory expenditure has been pared back. Wage cuts have worsened the low morale. “The biggest problem is shortage of staff because people are retired and never replaced,” said Dr Yiannis Papadatos, who runs the intensive care unit of one of the three paediatric hospitals in Athens. “Then there’s the problem of equipment and, periodically, lack of supplies like gloves, catheters, and cleaning tissues.” Small acts of heroism have done much to keep the broken system afloat: doctors and nurses work overtime, with donors and philanthropists also helping. Papadatos said: “I was brought up partly in Kenya by parents who emphasised the virtues of helping others. These days I spend a lot of time going round asking friends, or the private sector, for help when our hospital runs out of supplies. The monitors we use to track heart rhythms, blood pressure, that sort of thing, were all donated. People like to give. It makes them feel good.” Unionists argue that healthcare is an easy target because successive governments have refused to properly tackle tax evasion, the biggest drain on public coffers. In a rare public admission, the International Monetary Fund recently conceded that cuts had been so brutal “basic public services such as transport and healthcare are being compromised”. But at a time when the Greek debt crisis has flared again, after Tsipras’s controversial announcement of a series of welfare benefits, there are many who fear worse is to come. One of them is British-trained Dr Michalis Samarakos, who believes that while the health system is in need of further reform it also runs the risk of running out of specialists and clinical trainees. Already there has been a massive exodus of doctors abroad, mostly to Germany and the UK, as a result of lack of opportunity. “The best are leaving because their potential cannot be developed here,” he said. “I can see it teaching sixth-year students at Athens University, everyone wants a reference, everyone wants to go. “It’s become a growing problem. We don’t have nephrologists, for example, because there are no prospects for specialists, either in or out of the system [in private practice]. “Trainee doctors are the backbone of any hospital – without them hospitals can’t function. Unless there is a big change, I worry greatly that things can only become worse.”','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/01/patients-dying-greece-public-health-meltdown','\'Patients who should live are dying\': Greece\'s public health meltdown',40,'world'),('media/2017/jan/01/watership-down-was-no-utopia-for-the-does','Trevor Masters (Reasons to be cheerful about the world in 2016, Letters, 31 December) thanks the Guardian for being here to help us retain our sanity in the coming year, and cites examples of content to back up the claim.

It is a paradox that he is now heralded in some quarters as the global champion of all those causes, which everywhere seem under attack. The key to understanding this contradiction is that the pope is not himself a liberal. He is a conservative with a small c, mistrustful of all grand schemes of human betterment, whether socialist or libertarian, and he believes in sin and the devil – as do most of his 1.2 billion followers. If conservatism stands for anything more than the remorseless pursuit by the strong of their advantage over the weak, it is a profound suspicion of the human capacity to be good, a belief, as Milton put it, that we shall never cease “hammering from our flinty hearts the seeds and sparkles of new miseries for ourselves”. This isn’t the whole truth, but at a time when a world order seemingly based on rational self-interest is being consumed in greed and rage – including the “plague of terrorism” that Francis urged all to confront as it struck Turkey again – a little of Milton’s grim scepticism is salutary; even, almost, hopeful. For the pope, a world order based on the unlimited satisfaction of individual wants is unattainable, and the attempt to reach it destructive of the world around us, and of the peace of our inner worlds. As he wrote 18 months ago in his powerful encyclical on the environment: “When people become self-centred and self-enclosed, their greed increases. The emptier a person’s heart is, the more he or she needs things to buy, own and consume. It becomes almost impossible to accept the limits imposed by reality.” This attack was not confined to the one encyclical, but has been one of the most important themes of all his preaching, most recently in his New Year homily: “The lack of physical (and not virtual) contact is cauterising our hearts and making us lose the capacity for tenderness and wonder, for pity and compassion.” But, he continued, “we are not interchangeable items of merchandise or information processors. We are children, we are family, we are God’s People.” This is the development of a consistent line of Catholic criticism of the economist’s world that goes back at least​ as far as Pope Leo XIII’s 1891 Rerum Novarum, and arguably comes from the roots of western civilisation, in Aristotle and Aquinas. Catholic social teaching offers a coherent perspective on how the individual fits into society. It addresses directly the two great questions of our time: how the economy should be arranged to benefit everyone, and how our societies should treat the natural environment. Pope Francis has been an astonishingly eloquent advocate for human rights, for the environment, for peace and against the ravages of capitalism. He doesn’t do fluffy. In fact, at times, he sounds like a pure revolutionary. “We should be particularly indignant at the enormous inequalities in our midst,” he wrote in his 2015 encyclical. “We fail to see that some are mired in desperate and degrading poverty, with no way out, while others have not the faintest idea of what to do with their possessions, vainly showing off their supposed superiority and leaving behind them so much waste which, if it were the case everywhere, would destroy the planet. ... We continue to tolerate that some consider themselves more human than others.” With a passion perhaps possible only to a South American, he loathes the turbocharged US model of capitalism unleashed by Ronald Reagan: he entirely rejects the idea that greed restrained only by self-interest operating through a market will make the world just or good. His Catholicism is almost the polar opposite to the dominant strains of white American evangelical Christianity. He unequivocally opposes torture and the persecution of refugees, and even the death penalty, which are all causes dear to religious Republicans. More Americans support torture as an instrument of government policy than do the inhabitants of Iraq, Sudan or Afghanistan. With a series of dramatic gestures – visiting refugee camps; taking migrants into the Vatican; publicly washing the feet of a Muslim woman – the pope has demonstrated that he wants his church to stand alongside refugees and migrants. As archbishop of Buenos Aires he would visit the slums – and take a bus to get there. These are gestures eloquent of a much deeper intent. They set him against much of the modern world and the regimes in both Moscow and Washington. But they have also aroused bitter and well-funded opposition within his own church. The Vatican is a deeply and perhaps necessarily reactionary organisation, but an intelligent conservative like Pope Francis knows when times have changed and when to adapt. A reactionary confuses the present with the eternal, and thus can’t admit any change at all. The enemies around him Reactionaries must always lose in the long run. The world does change, and the change can’t be forever denied. But within the Catholic church they can and sometimes do manage to hold their positions for centuries. This is the dilemma that the pope faces as he tries to help the church come to terms with feminism. The Catholic church is a deeply patriarchal organisation: no one ever called a pope the Holy Mother; at the same time it is dependent on women whose work and devotion sustains the whole edifice. The concessions to feminism that he proposes don’t go as far as they might. He maintains the ban on women priests, and the complete opposition to abortion – although all priests may now forgive women who ask for it. But he has moved decisively to allow parishes to recognise some second marriages as real ones. He has been denounced for this by the reactionaries within the church as a heretic, a destructive progressive, and a man whose policies must lead to a historic schism and break with tradition. At the same time he has greatly disappointed progressives who had hoped for some shift in substance on the full acceptance of gay people and on the role of women in the church’s hierarchy. A champion of humanity Once more the apparent paradox dissolves in the light of the fact this is a conservative who believes that sin can corrupt anything, even, or perhaps especially, the church he heads. Church law and church rules can themselves become unrealistic schemes for organising society, as destructive in their dogmatic application as the precepts of Ayn Rand. His reactionary enemies, already praying and plotting for his succession, want a pope to proclaim “absolute moral norms that prohibit intrinsically evil acts and that are binding without exceptions” – which might sound reasonable until you realise they are not quoting a denunciation of war or slavery, but Pope John Paul II denouncing contraception. Yet in a world full of bewildering change, progressives as well as conservatives need to remember that moral absolutes exist and that there are some evils with which it is always wrong to compromise. Their form changes. A quarter of a century ago the Soviet Union fell. The attitudes that shaped the church then will not help it – or us – now. Global poverty, global greed, and the destruction of the environment are what threaten us today, and, however unlikely, Pope Francis is a champion of humanity against these evils.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/01/the-guardian-view-on-pope-francis-championing-humanity','The Guardian view on Pope Francis: championing humanity | Editorial',42,'commentisfree'),('football/2017/jan/01/stoke-city-watford-match-preview','There has been little festive cheer for Stoke after the fixture computer handed them trips to Anfield and Stamford Bridge in between Christmas and new year and despite flattering to deceive before losing both games, the visit of Watford gives them a chance to end on a high.

What conceivable rationale is there for engaging very young children with ICT screen technologies when it will inappropriately accelerate early child development, distort the natural development of the young child’s delicate growing senses and displace equivalent learning achievable through real, embodied human interaction? We’ve no idea what the long-term neurological, social and emotional impacts will be of exposing children to ubiquitous screen technologies; and until we do, a responsible precautionary principle is urgently called for, with any guidelines being evidence-based and grounded in reputable research.

Sean McAllister, a documentary filmmaker from Hull, said the Made In Hull event – a city-wide artistic installation around major landmarks – would show people that the city had hidden culture. A huge audience packed in to Queen Victoria Square to watch as stories of the city and its people over the last 70 years were projected on to nearby buildings. McAllister said: “We’re finally going to share our secret. If you’re from Hull, we always knew we had culture, it’s just the world didn’t know, so the secret’s out. Finally we’ve had to let them in. In a way we’ve kind of had these doors up to keep everybody out of our culture. “It’s just for us, we’ve had it as a subculture but, damn it, we’ve finally had to open the door to the international world and let them in. They can come and see what we’ve been enjoying.” From the devastating bombing during the second world war, to the disappearance of its fishing fleet in the 1970s due to the cod wars, to the decimation of its shipping industry, Hull has struggled during the last seven decades. Hull city council leader Stephen Brady called it “a city that had lost its confidence”. But he believes Hull’s tenure as UK City of Culture 2017 will breathe new life into the city. Hull is the second city to be given this honour, following Derry-Londonderry four years ago. It was selected in 2013 from a shortlist which included Dundee, Leicester and Swansea Bay. More than £30m is being spent on the year’s events and £25m has been invested in revamping the city centre and refurbishing the Ferens Art Gallery and the city’s main theatre. This, Brady says, is an attempt for the city to entice new businesses and employers who will bring their staff with them and create more jobs. The city recently secured a £310m commitment by the German-owned firm Siemens to build new offshore wind turbines in the city, creating up to 1,000 jobs. “We did it with Siemens and we can do it again. We want people to stay here, we want there to be opportunities. This year is so important in so many ways, we need it to breathe life into Hull and keep it buoyant for future generations,” he said. Brady, a former butcher’s boy who grew up in a three-bedroomed terraced house with his eleven siblings, says it was about time to change the conversation about his home city. He said: “Hull is a city like no other, it is more like a large village. “There is also the fact that it is the end of the line in terms of road and rail networks. There is essentially nowhere beyond, which gives it a very isolated feel. We needed something to keep people here, bring in new talent, jobs, employers. Getting this City of Culture status has been as sweet as a nut.” Celebrations began in earnest on Sunday night with the official opening spectacular. Thousands of people lined the waterfront for a fireworks display to mark the beginning of Made In Hull, as its historic buildings become backdrops for projections illustrating and celebrating more than 70 years of the city’s history. The crowd in the city centre square – where one of eight art installations will be located for the next week – chanted a countdown before a projection of a propeller was beamed on to the Ferens Art Gallery building. The crowd then fell silent as they watched Hull’s history, from pilot Amy Johnson’s solo flight to Australia in 1930 to the present day, projected around the square. Other installations in the Made In Hull event include Hullywood Icons, featuring local people recreating images from classic films, and a multi-screen and sound installation recreating the club scene in 90s Yorkshire. Sunday may be the official opening but the buzz began over the summer, when US artist Spencer Tunick convinced 3,200 locals to strip naked and have themselves painted blue for his trademark photographs around Hull’s landmarks celebrating the city’s relationship with the sea. Other events planned over the year include a visit by the Turner prize, plus a one-off gig from David Bowie’s old backing band, the Spiders from Mars. Brady, 70, who has been council leader since 2011, admits that some may have trouble coming to grips with some of the “wackier” installations, but he will be gritting his teeth and trying new things. Hull has ambitions to become the next Liverpool, which reinvented itself following its year as European Capital of Culture in 2008. The status earned the city bumper visitor numbers and a multimillion-pound boost to its economy. The festival year saw 9.7m visitors to the city, an increase of 34%, and generated £753.8m for the economy. Brady said: “The perception of Liverpool was forever changed after its city of culture year and that’s what we are hoping for here. We don’t want to return to our sleepy old times again – we want others to say it is a wonderful place that they will return to again and again.” So far, there have been upgrades to streets and public buildings in Hull city centre. The improvements include the makeover of Humber Street in the old Fruit Market, where galleries and other artistic businesses are based. A £700,000, 350-seat outdoor theatre will also be built in the city’s disused Central Dry Dock. One of its most famous sons, the poet Philip Larkin, once said it is “a city that is in the world, yet sufficiently on the edge of it to have a different resonance”. Brady said: “We are not a people that shout loudly or sing our own praises like others. We quietly go about our own way. But now those barriers are coming down and we will not disappoint.” Forthcoming events With a budget of £32m, there is expected to be a blizzard of arts and culture in the city over 365 days. These are some of the events taking place in the first three months.

For the way forward is not one nationwide progressive alliance, but rather multiple progressive alliances. To achieve an overarching national agreement is probably impossible. But progressive alliances can and already are forming – in individual parliamentary seats, across counties, across cities, sometimes at a council level, sometimes at parliamentary level. They’ll have different compositions in different places, according to local circumstances, but will be all the stronger for that, and more resilient. If talks break down or promises are broken in one place, it won’t bring the whole edifice down. As for what it is for: getting rid of the Tories is a worthy goal, but a bigger, and even more important, prize is getting a fair voting system; electoral reform that will finally give Britain a democracy, a government that reflects the will of the people. Neatly, that would then remove the need for electoral alliances, for a PR-majority parliament, with a genuine will to act, only needs to be achieved once. That’s a prize worth sacrifice and political pain along the way.

Only Telford was evidence of one thing: the progressive alliance in action. Labour almost certainly won the seat for the first time ever because a local deal was negotiated with the Greens and the Lib Dems, neither of whom stood a candidate. All the anti-Tory votes had one candidate to back and that Labour candidate won. The lesson is not that Labour can win alone, but that working together, the progressive parties can stop the Tories and introduce a new form of politics with the introduction of proportional voting.

Pop open a computer science journal on your laptop during 2016 and you’d be assured that not only was progress happening, but it was doing so much, much faster than predicted. Today, AI and algorithms dominate our lives – from the way financial markets carry out trades to the discovery of new pharmaceutical drugs and the means by which we discover and consume our news. But, like any invisible authority, such systems should be open to scrutiny. Yet too often they are not open and we are not even fully aware that such systems play the roles they do. For years now, companies such as Amazon, Google and Facebook have personalised the information we are fed; combing through our “metadata” to choose items they think we are most likely to be interested in. This is in stark contrast to the early days of online anonymity when a popular New Yorker cartoon depicted a computer-using canine with the humorous tagline: “On the internet, nobody knows you’re a dog.” In 2017, not only do online companies know that we’re dogs, but also our breed and whether we prefer Bakers or Pedigree. The use of algorithms to control the way that we’re treated extends well beyond Google’s personalised search or Facebook’s customised news feed. Tech giants such as Cisco have explored the way in which the internet could be divided into groups of customers who would receive preferential download speeds based on their perceived value. Other companies promise to use breakthroughs in speech-recognition technology in call centres: sending customers through to people with a similar personality type to their own for more effective call resolution rates. It is a mistake to always decry this kind of personalisation as a negative. The futurist and writer Arthur C Clarke once noted that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Most of us will have had the awed feeling of watching a really good magic trick when their smartphone uninvitedly pops up a relevant piece of information at just the right moment – like your iPhone remembering where your car is parked. But the feeling is often tempered by a moment of doubt. Is it a bit creepy that Google knows your favourite football club? Are we being shown only the news that matches Facebook’s vision of who we are? Most of the time we don’t know because the algorithms’ internal workings remain inaccessible to us. The academic Sherry Turkle makes an interesting observation about PCs in the 1980s, when families started buying home computers and endless lines of green text gave way to sumptuous graphical user interfaces. At this point, she has suggested, computers moved from being a hobbyist machine you could open up and physically tinker with to a machine you could learn to operate immediately, even if you didn’t know exactly how it was working. Computers, Turkle playfully noted, begged to be taken not at face value but at interface value. It doesn’t take much to see that this philosophy has continued to develop over the years. This is particularly true when talking about artificial intelligence systems. Some of today’s most impressive advances in fields such as machine learning (the goal of getting a machine to, well, learn) rely on tools such as “deep learning neural networks”. These are systems patterned after the way the human brain works but which, ironically, are almost entirely inscrutable to humans. Trained with only inputs and outputs, and tweaking one or the other until the middle part “just works”, human creators have long since sacrificed understanding in favour of results. Since such tools will increasingly be used for more complex use-cases such as AI-driven warfare, prioritising patients in hospital and determining which areas of a city should be most heavily policed, questioning them is essential. We may view computers as coolly objective – hence the sci-fi trope of the machine that gains emotions and then goes wrong – but human bias and error can enter into algorithms, too. It’s when we believe that such systems are beyond question (and lack the means to question them if we change our mind) that things get problematic. So what’s the answer? This is a more complex challenge than many of the over-the-air quick fixes Silicon Valley loves to engage with. You can cut down on speech you don’t like on Twitter by banning people who say things you don’t agree with. That’s not so easy when the positives and negatives of technology are so deeply entwined. Technology in this sense is a bit like the political system: there are so many decisions to take that we hand the overwhelming majority of them to someone we trust. There is some evidence to suggest things are changing. The issue of AI accountability is shaping up to be one of this year’s hot topics, ethically and technologically. Recently, researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory published preliminary work on deep learning neural networks that can not only offer predictions and classifications, but also rationalise their decisions. Artificial intelligence achieved a lot in 2016. One of the goals in 2017 should be to make its workings more transparent. With plenty riding on it, this could be the year when, to coin a phrase, we begin to take back control.

But when Olivier Giroud blurred the line between the virtually real and the gloriously tangible, he did more than set Arsenal on their way to victory over Crystal Palace. He lit up the Emirates Stadium and provided a memory for years to come. Giroud’s 17th-minute opener recalled the finish of Henrikh Mkhitaryan for Manchester United against Sunderland on Boxing Day. There were shades of a scorpion kick, albeit with only one leg; a rainbow flick or whatever else the gamers want to call it. But when Giroud’s back-heeled flick – recalled from a distance behind him and on the run, too – arched in off the underside of Wayne Hennessey’s crossbar, the stadium and the watching TV millions felt their jaws drop. Even Giroud looked a little stunned. Arsenal coasted to the points thereafter, with Alex Iwobi providing the tempo and incision in the No10 role in the absence of Mesut Özil, who was ill. Iwobi added the second goal; a looping header after Palace had left him unmarked only four yards out. Palace’s defending continues to be a cause of high anxiety. Sam Allardyce’s team had a brief flurry around the hour mark but it was not an afternoon when the club’s new manager could trumpet too many positives with any conviction. It said much that he substituted Yohan Cabaye, Andros Townsend and Christian Benteke well before the end, with one eye, perhaps, on conserving energy for the home game against Swansea City on Tuesday. Giroud’s goal transcended the occasion and if the finish was a thing of exquisite class, it was worth going over every detail of the buildup, including the striker’s role in it, which was crucial. After Lucas Pérez – who looked off the pace on a rare Premier League start – had slid in to intercept on the edge of his own area, Héctor Bellerín initiated the break with a sharp pass up to Giroud but it was what happened next that really got Arsenal moving. With his first back-heel, he found Granit Xhaka and he played in Iwobi who, in turn, made the right pass forward to Alexis Sánchez. Giroud had bolted up in support but, when Sánchez’s cross arrived, it was a full yard behind him. No problem. Giroud adjusted his body shape and, in a moment of improvisational genius, he had reached back his left boot, located the ball and flicked it with his heel over his head and towards the roof of the net. Hennessey could do nothing to keep it out. The first thought was of Mkhitaryan but Giroud was further out than the United forward – he was about 12 yards from goal – and the goalkeeper had looked better placed. As the Arsenal supporters who filed past the press box were also keen to point out, Giroud was onside; Mkhitaryan had been just ahead of the last man. Whatever the arguments, it was plain that Giroud had illuminated this game to a degree that went beyond merely shaping it. In classic Giroud and Arsenal style, he had been guilty of a bad miss from an easier chance on seven minutes, after Xhaka’s dinked pass out to Nacho Monreal and the full-back’s low, first-time cross. In front of goal, Giroud could not set his feet in time and Mohamed Elneny’s follow-up shot was headed away by James Tomkins. Giroud had sorted himself out by the time that Sánchez crossed for him shortly afterwards. It was only Giroud’s second Premier League start of the season but he now has five goals in the competition and the statistics show that they have come at a rate of one every 69.8 minutes. The next best record in the top flight belongs to Watford’s Stefano Okaka, who has scored once every 97.5 minutes. Arsenal called the tune and it said everything that when Cabaye had a shot on target in the 37th minute, which was the definition of routine for the Arsenal goalkeeper, Petr Cech, the travelling fans celebrated wildly. “We’ve had a shot, we’ve had a shot,” they chorused, sarcastically. Palace’s chaotic streak at the back, which Allardyce has been charged with stamping out, was evident in first-half stoppage time, when a Bellerín cross sparked such panic that the only surprise was the Keystone Cops did not arrive on the scene. With Martin Kelly all over the place, Iwobi won the ball and Sánchez had a chance from close range. His shot, though, was too close to Hennessey, who blocked. Arsène Wenger would lament his team’s failure to kill the game sooner than they did. Palace were poor in possession in the first half but they had what Allardyce described as “our defining moment” on 47 minutes, when Townsend crossed for Benteke and one of the best headers of a ball in Europe found himself up against Bellerín at the far post. He failed to get a clean connection and the effort bobbled wide. The visitors had their purple patch after Iwobi’s goal, which followed Monreal’s cross and Scott Dann’s diversion high into the air. Benteke worked Cech with a header from a corner and Cabaye went close with the follow-up while Kelly swung and missed when well placed and Cech was made to save by Townsend. This game, however, was all about one player and one moment.','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/01/arsenal-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report','Olivier Giroud’s brilliant back-heel helps Arsenal sink Crystal Palace',49,'football'),('society/2017/jan/01/richard-baker-obituary','My husband Richard Baker, who has died aged 66 of cancer, was a sailor, museum attendant, writer and gardener and, for more than 30 years, lead builder of the Skinningrove bonfire, east Cleveland. Thousands flocked annually to his beautiful, enormous sculptures of dinosaurs, goblins, ships, castles and more, built from scrap wood at this spectacular community event. Richard invited contributions from everyone, whatever their abilities, encouraging people to value their addition, as he did. When darkness falls on Skinningrove each 5 November, this huge fire is a magical sight. In 2015, it featured as the Guardian’s Picture of the Day. The son of a naval officer, Christopher Baker, and his wife, Jean (nee Crabtree), Richard was born in Dunfermline when his father was stationed at Limekilns. When his father was posted to New Zealand, the family spent three years living near Takapuna beach. They returned to Blakeney, Norfolk, and then settled in nearby Cley. Richard went to school in Blickling, then boarded at King Edward VII grammar school, King’s Lynn, before embarking on a degress in English and American studies at Nottingham University. On graduating he became a contributor to alternative publications and later he wrote about English street life, using Hogarth’s drawings as his starting point. Richard and I met in 1974 at Theatre Centre, Kensal Green, north-west London, where we were both community arts workers. We were briefly engaged in that year, but did not marry until 2003. Between 1979 and 1993 we were based in Stockton-on-Tees and began visiting Whitby, which we grew to love. We started the Skinningrove bonfire along with local people in 1980. When my work took me around the country, Richard would often find new things to do too. He was, by turns, a proofreader, shepherd, barman, beach cleaner, clown, busker, musician, roadie, gardener and maker of giant puppets. In 1993, we moved to Dawlish, in Devon, but continued to return to the north-east to build the bonfire. We finally retired to Whitby in 2007. Richard was a well-known Church Street character and guide on ghost walks; he was in his element as a performing storyteller. He also worked in the Captain Cook Memorial Museum. When he saw the replica ship HM Bark Endeavour on its return to Britain in 1997 it was love at first sight. Richard sailed 1,000 miles as crew on six tall-ship voyages, three on the Endeavour replica in the early 2000s. He wrote poetry until his death, arranging his final pamphlet for distribution at his funeral in St Mary’s church, near Whitby Abbey. Richard is survived by me, and by his brothers, Timothy and Philip, and sisters, Diana and Teresa.','https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/01/richard-baker-obituary','Richard Baker obituary',50,'society'),('world/2017/jan/01/mohammed-ramzan-obituary','My father, Mohammed Ramzan (“Abu”), who has died aged 79, was a community activist and religious teacher in the Sufi tradition. In 1969 on a trip to Pakistan he met Barkat Ali, a former British Indian Army officer who had renounced the world, vowing to live the life of a fakir. Barkat Ali began a movement, Dar-ul-Ehsan (“House of Blessings”) with three aims: selfless service to all without discrimination, zikr or the rhythmic chanting of the names of Allah in communal worship and the active communication of Islam in what he considered its true form. Abu became his murid (disciple) and was appointed Barkat Ali’s representative in the UK. Abu was born in the village of Babyam in Kashmir, then part of British-controlled India, to Alma Bi and Mohammed Hussain, who were subsistence farmers. In 1960 his region was submerged and populations displaced to enable the development of the Mangla Dam, a major hydro-electric project. Young men were offered visas to Britain to help fill the labour shortage. Abu arrived in 1962 and drove buses in Newcastle upon Tyne. However, early bouts of ill-health made him question his migration, and his search for meaning eventually led him to Barkat Ali. In 1973 he moved to Watford, Hertfordshire, where his mission really began. He campaigned for a mosque for the small Muslim community. His profile led to a racist attack while he was working as a local station ticket collector. Undeterred, he continued conveying the teachings of Barkat Ali and introducing Islam to local authorities, schools, prisons and interfaith groups. Since Sunni Islam has no priesthood, in the pre-internet age Abu’s pastoral mission changed lives. Many second-generation British-born Muslims, increasingly alienated by their parents’ values and finding no solace in mosques, turned to Abu for spiritual guidance, counselling and religious instruction. He had charisma and, unusually for his generation, he spoke fluent English without the subcontinental twang; young people felt a connection. The front-room of our small terraced house was the centre of Abu’s life. On its carpet he would sit, patiently listening, rolling his tasbih (prayer beads) in silent zikr, as individuals talked through their problems. Often we would host groups of people, of all sorts, and Abu would engage them in discussions on diverse topics. This would be followed by a meal of freshly baked chapatis and dahl, washed down with tea (all prepared by my mother Walit). While he was firmly within the orthodox Sunni tradition, Abu differed from other Sufis in seeing no use in retreating from the world, thriving instead on robust discussion and frank, good-natured exchange. He had an ecumenical streak and was inspired by and sought to build bridges with the Shia branch of Islam in particular. From 1980 until his retirement in 1998 he worked as a bus driver for the local college and was a familiar sight in Watford with his distinctive long beard and khaki prayer cap. His job suited him, he often said, because his appearance was a great conversation-starter. Abu is survived by Walit, whom he married in 1965, their daughter, Tahira, and three sons, me, Azeem and Omar, and seven grandchildren.','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/01/mohammed-ramzan-obituary','Mohammed Ramzan obituary',51,'world'),('commentisfree/2017/jan/01/driverless-cars-boon-bane-coming-down-fast-lane','If there’s one thing 2016 taught us it’s that political predictions are a mug’s game. Predictions about technology and society, however, are at least a little easier. One thing that’s going to rub up against our noses during 2017 is the imminence of the driverless car revolution, which is going to be a big one. Around our house there is a new noise. It’s my voice, in a tone of authoritarian command, saying: “Alexa, stop!” Or perhaps, “Alexa, play the Beach Boys”; or “Alexa, what’s the weather like tomorrow?” Yes, like thousands of others, I got the new Amazon toy for Christmas – a small cylinder that can answer many questions with enormous speed and proficiency, play music, order taxis, dictate recipes and much else besides. Yet Alexa, already transforming life in my household, is nothing compared to the changes that driverless cars are going to visit on us very soon. Not long ago this was science fiction, but in 2016 we saw them tested on the streets of Milton Keynes. Meanwhile, in San Francisco, a row between Uber and the state of California over licences saw driverless cars removed from the streets and the first fatal car crash in the US involving a car on autopilot. Next year the UK government hopes we will see trials of driverless cars on British motorways. So it’s time for some serious thinking about what’s coming down the fast lane in 2017. Let’s start with the positives. First, quite a lot of people who would be killed or maimed on the roads if we carry on as we are will be saved. It may seem counter-intuitive, but almost all studies on properly equipped driverless cars suggest they are safer than those driven by humans. There is an additional safety advantage for women, who worry about late-night taxi rides. A driverless car might seem a sinister invention to some people – but it isn’t going to rape you. Driverless cars should also greatly improve the urban landscape. We have become used to the ugliness of almost every street being choked by parked vehicles, but there would be almost no point in most of us owning a car. The cost of a cab ride is mostly made up by paying the driver, and therefore local rides would be dramatically cheaper. It will seem outlandishly extravagant to blow tens of thousands of pounds on buying a piece of equipment you can hire whenever you need it for far less. Petrolheads on a Jeremy Clarkson kick will still want to own their cars, but for most people this will be a big saving. So our streets will be clearer. And, because these will be electric cars, cleaner too. There will have to be vast new infrastructure systems – huge garages to store the cars so they can arrive quickly when ordered. I wonder whether local train services will survive. We may see a return to the Thatcherite proposal for railway lines to be turned into roads, this time for driverless cars. As for buses, at the moment we have a largely undiscussed transport apartheid between car owners and bus users. But if driverless cars work then surely there will be driverless buses, which can be a lot smaller and more numerous than today’s diesel-spewing vehicles. At the other end of the scale, car sharing and car pooling, already popular, will expand: the distinction between somebody using a driverless minibus and driverless, large shared car could become meaningless. Put all this together and I can imagine car ownership, and car driving, being frowned on as much as opening a packet of fags at a family gathering is now. But let’s turn to the dark side of this. First, the effect on jobs. There are just under 300,000 HGV drivers licensed in the UK and about the same number of licensed taxi and cab drivers in England and Wales. But these figures are probably an underestimate of the actual numbers of professional drivers, given the black/grey economy and the local delivery drivers. Putting all this together, I wouldn’t be surprised if there were around a million people across the UK dependent upon driving others, or goods, or takeaways for their living. But the numbers are only the half of it. In an age of job insecurity, driving has become the default way that many people, particularly men, keep their heads above water. If you can’t find anything else, sign up with a local cab firm and spend long hours on the streets. So the effect of this version of job destruction will be harsh, and require redistribution. Who will be the huge gainers from the driverless car revolution? Presumably the biggest car companies, and those at the forefront of the technology – Tesla, Mercedes, Honda – and the taxi companies, like Uber. Both can expect to make gargantuan profits. How do you channel some of that money back into the economy to provide jobs for the former drivers? That’s the old question about the taxation of multinationals. I don’t see&nbsp;any chance of our society running out of things for human beings to do – not with the care crisis, or the needs of&nbsp;the NHS, or the almost endless amounts of environmental work to be done. It’s about funding, by effectively taxing the new profits. There are also safety issues. This entire system depends upon the internet. A terrorist attack, or even a large solar flare, could knock everything out. The more interconnected we are, the more vulnerable we are. This is such a huge issue I would expect it to be a major political question&nbsp;for the year ahead. As with most technological advances, driverless cars will be a wonderful future or a looming disaster, dependent on the political choices we make. That, at least,&nbsp;hasn’t changed. Has it, Alexa?','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/01/driverless-cars-boon-bane-coming-down-fast-lane','The driverless car revolution isn’t just about technology – it’s about society too | Jackie Ashley',52,'commentisfree'),('film/2017/jan/01/from-groundhog-day-to-raging-bull-films-to-inspire-and-uplift','Can films be inspirational? Well, the good ones all are. And, in a broader sense, going to the cinema is a narcotic, luxurious experience that makes you feel inspired, uplifted and stimulated. But when people talk about “inspirational” films – underdogs achieving spectacular sporting success, charismatic teachers winning over pupils, people overcoming disabilities – I am sometimes a bit agnostic. An inspirational film often feels soupy and syrupy, schematic and cliched, faintly coercive and reactionary. Inspirational means aspirational, no arguments – and it brings out my ironic, grumpy Brit. When I’m asked for my favourite inspirational scene, I nominate Tom Courtenay’s final, miserable act of defiance in The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner. One movie that was lauded as inspirational, The Blind Side, features Sandra Bullock in an Oscar-winning performance as a well-to-do Christian Republican mom in the Sarah Palin mould. She takes in a troubled African American teen and helps mould him into a top football player. This was a huge hit in 2009, with great swathes of America undoubtedly deeming it to be inspirational (perhaps the “inspirational” movie is itself an American genre). Personally, I felt it unwise to leave the sick bag beyond arm’s length. The same goes, incidentally, for Clint Eastwood’s terrible Invictus, about the South African Springboks’ earnest battle for the 1995 Rugby World Cup, under the kindly eye of Nelson Mandela. I like Rocky as much as anyone, but I’m quite sure Raging Bull, with its dark, mysterious poetry of defeat and survival, is in a different weight class. And there is something inspiring in the final audacious quotation from the Gospel of St John: “All I know is this: once I was blind and now I can see.” Yet sometimes films are genuinely inspirational, specifically because they don’t indulge irony or nuance (it could be that inspirational, like comedy or romcom, is a genre that isn’t critically acceptable). I have a soft spot for that fierce heartwarmer, The Pursuit of Happyness, directed by the Italian master of dolce, Gabriele Muccino, and starring Will Smith. It is a true story about a guy called Chris Gardner who once faced poverty as a jobless single dad, got an unpaid internship at a prestigious firm, and had to keep up appearances alongside the pampered yuppies competing for a permanent job, while he and his son slept in hostels or even subway toilets. Yes, it’s treacly and unashamedly premised on the idea of material success, the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. But it’s forthright and well made. It doesn’t exactly inspire you, but it is touching and successful in its sentimental-euphoric inspirational mode. In this vein, I have to give credit to a sweet and good-natured movie based on a true story: October Sky, with Jake Gyllenhaal as a grim-faced coalminer’s son who is inspired by Russia’s Sputnik to go into rocket science when he leaves school. As for the inspirational-teacher films such as Good Will Hunting and Dead Poets Society, again I am agnostic. They garnered a lot of awards-season euphoria, but I am not sure they have aged well. They certainly show that Robin Williams was the King of Inspirational, in the same way you might call Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly the King of Song and Dance. Something in his hyperactive funniness – vulnerable, secretly wounded, dripping with empathy, morally strong – made him the incarnation of inspirational: the teacher figure who wasn’t distant or fierce, but often a kind of rocket-fuelled version of the class clown who was on the kids’ side. Williams did this so well that he was never quite convincing in the “darker” roles he tried at the end of his career. Laurent Cantet’s Entre Les Murs (The Class) is a French film about a tough inner-city school. Maybe it’s too tough to count as inspirational, although its seriousness is inspiring in a way – as is the final, enigmatically moving shot of the empty classroom. And a mention should go to Goodbye, Mr Chips, the 1939 version, with Robert Donat as the much-loved public schoolmaster who teaches generations of boys right in the decades leading up to the first world war; despite his own poignantly short and childless marriage, he thinks of all these boys as his children. Goodbye, Mr Chips is an example of how the inspirational movie is a cousin to the weepie. It’s a Wonderful Life deserves a kind of peripheral inclusion here, for being where inspirational triangulates with the weepie and the Christmas film. Part of the agenda of the sentimental Christmas movie is to inspire characters and audience to lead better lives. That is very much the point of Frank Capra’s celebrated work, in which George Bailey is shown a vision (not dissimilar to those vouchsafed to Scrooge) of what his hometown would have been like if he had not sacrificed his own ambitions to help the community. Just as inspirational – and brilliant – is Harold Ramis’s Groundhog Day. Bill Murray’s misanthropic weatherman is trapped in a repeating day, made to go through it again and again, and inspect his own life in all the detail he had arrogantly ignored, with an infinite amount of time to acquaint himself with every square millimetre of the hokey small town he had presumed to despise. He becomes a better person, but the film’s own comic miracle is that it doesn’t labour this point, despite Murray’s hilariously laborious ordeal, or even make it explicit. And I think that is inspirational. But for me, the one genre I find really and truly inspirational – without having to claim it as a “guilty pleasure” – is any film about people forming bands at school. Movies such as John Carney’s Sing Street and Lukas Moodyson’s We Are the Best! are genuinely inspirational because they are about self-betterment and self-fulfilment, in their way, but no one is telling the pupil musicians they have to do it to get good grades or be a more responsible person. In fact, the grownup world is usually frowning at the whole idea of being in something as disreputable as a pop group. So there is something entrepreneurial, creative and rebellious about it. Under this heading, I would also include Good Vibrations, an excellent film about Terri Hooley, the record shop owner who nurtured Belfast’s punk scene and brought the Undertones to the world. Isolating a moment of inspiration in a film is an interesting challenge. Alexander Payne’s About Schmidt is a relentlessly dark film on the painful theme of family dysfunction. Jack Nicholson’s performance is dyspeptic and despairing: his face (like Paul Giamatti’s in Sideways or Bruce Dern’s in Nebraska) is on the point of becoming an immobile mask of disappointment or despair. Yet every time I see him burst into tears at his letter from the little African boy, I find the moment euphoric … and, yes, sort of inspirational. There is something irresistible in the possibility of Schmidt’s redemption, even in its broad implausibility. So maybe About Schmidt is my favourite motivational film.

Arsenal go back up to third, a point above Spurs and Manchester City, after a win that was totally routine, save for Olivier Giroud’s spectacular opening goal, which was anything but. It’s the only thing we’ll remember from this game in a year’s time, and a moment of individual brilliance that may take the next 12 months to top. Thanks for joining me; our match report will follow shortly. Cheerio! 92 mins: Palace’s hardy away following cheer as their team string a few passes together – but they’re soon on the back foot, Sánchez skipping into the area and teeing up Oxlade-Chamberlain, in acres of space. Hennessey gets down well to parry his low shot, and keep it at 2-0. 91 mins: Three added minutes. 90 mins: His cross-shot is flicked over the bar by Tomkins. From the corner, it’s worked back to Xhaka, whose shot is closed down. 89 mins: Ramsey is tripped by Tomkins, picking up a yellow card and conceding a free kick. Xhaka will swing this one in from wide on the right... 87 mins: Ramsey gets involved, picking up Oxlade-Chamberlain’s pass, carving out a yard of space and smashing a shot just wide of Hennessey’s near post. 85 mins: A textbook New Year’s Day scoreline in the National League, where it’s finished Forest Green 5-5 Torquay. 83 mins: Zaha slips between Monreal and Coquelin, forcing the former to take one for the team with a cynical clip to his heels. He is booked, but Mutch’s free-kick drifts out of play. 81 mins: Ward and Kelly have been put through their paces at full-back today. Oxlade-Chamberlain is the latest to put the hurt on Ward, zipping past him down the right and firing a low cross that’s cleared away. 80 mins: This match is meandering towards a conclusion, with two of Palace’s first-choice attacking threats off the pitch. So, why not watch this instead: 78 mins: Sánchez cuts inside and crosses towards Giroud, who doesn’t make contact but distracts Hennessey, who has to make an awkward one-handed save to keep it from drifting into the far corner. 76 mins: Change for Palace, with Benteke replaced by Campbell. The scoreline suggests he should be staying on, his performance less so – but perhaps, with Swansea visiting Selhurst Park on Tuesday, he and Townsend are being rested. 75 mins: Sánchez takes it, but fires his free-kick into the wall. One final change for Arsenal, with goalscorer Iwobi replaced by Oxlade-Chamberlain. 74 mins: Arsenal have changed shape slightly, with Ramsey and Coquelin beefing up central midfield, leaving Iwobi and Sánchez to support Giroud. Bellerín is brought down 25 yards out, just right of goal. Xhaka and Sánchez are over the free kick... 71 mins: Two Arsenal changes, as Elneny and Lucas head off, replaced by Ramsey and Coquelin. One for Palace, with Townsend replaced by Lee Chung-yong. 70 mins: Zaha doesn’t track Bellerín back downfield, and the Arsenal man’s cut-back is hacked away. Xhaka then tries to test Hennessey from a long, long way out, but his shot is deflected behind. 69 mins: Zaha does get the better of Bellerín down the left this time, and his low cross is smartly cleared away by Xhaka, who’s been quietly impressive again today. 67 mins: Bellerín, described by Gary Neville as “a good full-back” and “not a great defender” in quick succession, makes a smart interception to strip the ball from Zaha. He combines with the useful Lucas down the right, but his cross in the direction of Giroud is claimed by Hennessey. 65 mins: Townsend and Zaha are finding, to their amazement, that when they venture into the Arsenal half, they’re getting some joy. Townsend leads a counter attack that ends with a slightly wild Zaha effort, but they’re making in-roads. An attacking change here, as Cabaye is replaced by Jordon Mutch. “Big Sam should wear one of those helmet hats with cup holders and straws so he can sip on some lager as he watches his new team” says JR in Illinois. “And when Zaha leaves for a month he might want to replace the lager with gin. Or paint thinner.” 63 mins: Townsend sends another deep cross in which catches Cech off guard, forcing the keeper to tip it behind. 62 mins: Arsenal try to shake off their traditional post-goal slump, Sánchez again front-and-centre, but the move peters out. 60 mins: From the corner, Kelly miskicks as the ball bobbles into his path, before Townsend stings Cech’s palms again from the left of the area. If only the visitors had started the second half like this... 59 mins: Palace win a corner, and Benteke forces Cech into an awkward save with a bullet header. The ball is cleared as far as Cabaye, whose long-distance effort has Cech back-pedalling to turn the ball wide! That could go down as a Joel Ward own goal, the Palace full-back attempting to clear, but heading the ball in off his own bar. That rather sums up Palace’s day. Sánchez has had Palace dancing to his tune all game long, and he sends several defenders the wrong way with a reverse pass to Monreal, whose cross is cleared by Dann, high into the air. It lands in the six-yard box, and Iwobi heads over Hennessey and into the roof of the net, despite the efforts of two Palace players on the line. Palace can’t keep Arsenal out any longer, Alex Iwobi with an agreeably scrappy goal, in contrast to the opener. 53 mins: “Up! Up! Up!” shouts Allardyce, looking ever more like an irate binman on the touchline. Palace don’t listen, and Sánchez drifts inside and picks out Lucas Pérez, whose cross wafts out of play. 50 mins: The pattern from the first half has returned, with Arsenal stringing silky passes around in front of a packed Palace defence. Sánchez pulls off a flamboyant stepover in space, but drills his pass to Lucas straight at a defender. 49 mins: Moments later, a scramble sees Iwobi’s shot blocked before Sánchez lashes at goal. It could have gone anywhere, but smashes off the fortunate, or unfortunate, Scott Dann and out to safety. 48 mins: Arsenal try to make Palace pay, Sánchez drilling a pass to Lucas, who steers it across goal, with nobody there. 46 mins: Palace’s best chance by a mile, as Townsend cuts back onto his left foot, and hangs a cross up towards Benteke. He has the jump on Bellerín, but doesn’t get a clean header, the ball squirting past the far post! We’re back under way. Bellerín immediately bursts down the right, but his low cross is cleared away. The internet is currently ablaze with scorpion kicks and flicks from the archive. Thanks to ‘Mister Justin’ for this one: “Arsène seems complacently to have disposed of his general’s hat, with scenes of comic bedragglement in front of goal to follow” says Charles Antaki. “Hopefully it’s hanging up somewhere handy for the second half.” A first half memorable only for an extraordinary Olivier Giroud goal. If Palace want this game to be remembered for anything else, they’ll need to get their act together. Back soon. 45 mins: Another defensive masterclass from Palace, Kelly toe-poking a harmless Bellerín cross back into danger, allowing Sánchez a free hit from close to the penalty spot. Hennessey saves, and Palace are let off the hook. 43 mins: Palace have begun to inch upfield, but Arsenal exploit the gaps, the ball worked to Sánchez, whose shot from 20 yards has power, but flies into Hennessey’s arms. There’ll be one minute of added time. 41 mins: Zaha finally gets some forward momentum, jinking away from Giroud and drawing a foul. Another long ball, another meek effort by Benteke to reel it in, and it bounces through to Cech. 38 mins: Shades of a training exercise, with Arsenal’s wide players trying to find inventive ways of infiltrating a crowded penalty area. Sánchez races to the byline, then back, and hits an angled cross over everybody’s heads. 36 mins: Iwobi tries to lift the ball towards Giroud, who has drifted offside. Arsenal’s intensity dropping again, as half-time approaches. 34 mins: Elneny has all the time in the world to slot a pass to Lucas Pérez, whose cushioned pass finds Sánchez on the corner of the penalty area. His shot swerves wide of the far post, the entire move happening without a Palace player getting within three yards of an opponent. 32 mins: Townsend and Kelly are getting in each other’s way trying to deal with Sánchez, whose looping cross finds Monreal, a fraction offside. This has been an entirely enjoyable first half hour for Arsenal. 30 mins: Elneny threads a pass over Crystal Palace’s ten-man defence, but Bellerín is unable to keep his cross in play. 28 mins: Palace enjoy a spell of possession in the Arsenal half, and Townsend looks to find Zaha with a deep cross. It’s overhit, and by some distance. 26 mins: Iwobi dances in the penalty area, then lays the ball back to Elneny, steaming forward from midfield, who slaps an ambitious 30-yarder a long way wide. Arsenal may be trying to score a better goal than Giroud’s, and that’s to be applauded. Here’s Will W with a lesser-spotted scorpion kick – second in the clip, and “the first one isn’t bad either”: 24 mins: Arsenal have slowed the pace down, stroking it around before a Palace break is ended by the half-hearted Benteke drifting offside. 22 mins: I’ll be honest, I’m still thinking about the goal. 20 mins: Townsend almost gives us something else to savour, trying to prevent a corner and almost handing the ball to Monreal five yards out. Hennessey scrambles to spare his team-mate’s blushes. Scorpion kicks, they’re like buses. You wait years for one, etc and so on. I particularly enjoyed the lusty “ooooh” from the crowd when it was replayed on the Emirates big screen. Palace tried to break upfield, and were immediately caught short at the back, the ball worked swiftly to Sánchez on the left. His cross was high and behind Giroud, lurking 12 yards out, but the striker executed a sublime scorpion kick, sending the ball in off the bar with his left heel! Henrikh Mkhitaryan, eat your heart out. Olivier Giroud may have just scored the goal of the season! 15 mins: Iwobi tests Hennessey from 12 yards out, but the keeper gathers his slippery low shot at the second time of asking. 13 mins: Arsenal continue their efforts to unpick the Palace defence, but Sánchez’s return ball to the lively Lucas Pérez is overhit, and Palace have a chance to relieve the pressure. 11 mins: Arsenal have hit their straps early on, and Lucas combines artfully with Elneny, and then Bellerín, lofting a pass towards the full-back that’s cleared away. It comes straight back, and Sánchez lets rip from 25 yards out, his shot pinging a foot wide of Hennessey’s far post. On manager’s hats, Justin Kavanagh says “I’m seeing Arsène in a Napoleon’s hat, with hand hidden in his big long puffy coat, with Big Sam dressed as the Duke of Wellington in the other coach’s area.” Allardyce, disappointingly, has a regulation beanie on. 8 mins: Townsend steps on Monreal’s ankle chasing a 50-50 ball, and is lucky to escape further action from birthday boy Andre Marriner. 6 mins: How are Arsenal not ahead here? Xhaka, pulling the strings behind that creative trio, slots an identical low pass, this time to Monreal on the left. He cuts back to Giroud, unmarked at the near post – but he doesn’t make contact, and his weird flailing puts off Lucas, stationed on the other side of goal! 5 mins: Lucas, Iwobi and Sánchez are swirling behind Giroud, causing Palace all sorts of problems. Iwobi tries a diagonal daisy-cutter to Bellerín, but it’s just about cut out. 4 mins: There’s a muted atmosphere in the early stages, which means we can hear Keith Millen bellowing at Wilfried Zaha to track back. Lucas, who was excellent against Basel in the Champions League from the right, almost latches on to a through-ball, but Hennessey is out smartly to clear. “At last the answer to Arsène’s worries about his players faffing about before scoring” says Charles Antaki. “Procure one of those superb general’s hats and all will be resolved.” I’m surprised Antonio Conte doesn’t wear one already. 2 min: Iwobi toe-pokes a pass through to Sánchez, who barrels in from the left but gets crowded out. Corner, which Xhaka swings just out of reach of Koscielny. Palace not exactly well-drilled at the back early on. We’re off... The players are out at a drizzly, dark Emirates Stadium. Predictions? I’m going to stick my neck out, and say Arsenal will shade possession, and win by one late goal. In meaningless milestone news, this is the 200th Premier League game played here: The quality of football in this clip escalates dramatically: The aforementioned warm-up proved too much for Ezekiel Fryers, who picked up an injury and is replaced on the bench by academy graduate Michael Phillips. Palace’s squad is stretched thin; Sam Allardyce confirms that James Tomkins has been rushed back with a lack of defensive options. Arsène Wenger says he’s been forced to rotate, with a trip to Bournemouth coming up on Tuesday. Half an hour to go; the players are out warming up in assorted beanies, leggings and snoods. Would you like to see a picture of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain feeding a baby tiger? Of course you would. Result! It finished Watford 1-4 Tottenham at Vicarage Road. Rob Smyth watched it unfold: Spurs climb above Arsenal in the table, for now. A surprise win for Palace would leave the Gunners stuck in fifth, and the bottom three a little isolated. If you’ve no idea what the table looks like, after the relentless flurry of festive football (there’s more games tomorrow, you know), it’s here. Some enjoyable pre-match reading from David Hytner, on Arsène Wenger’s long history with Sam Allardyce: No Mesut Özil for Arsenal today – he’s unwell, so the grapevine tells me – so Lucas Pérez gets his first Premier League start since the opening day. Nacho Monreal replaces Kieran Gibbs at left-back, and Mohamed Elneny is in for Francis Coquelin, who’s on the bench. Allardyce makes just one change, with James Tomkins back in central defence in place of Damien Delaney, who is on the naughty step after picking up a fifth booking against Watford. Arsenal: Cech; Bellerín, Gabriel, Koscielny, Monreal; Elneny, Xhaka; Lucas Pérez, Iwobi, Sánchez; Giroud. Subs: Ospina, Ramsey, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Mustafi, Reine-Adélaïde, Coquelin, Maitland-Niles. Crystal Palace: Hennessey; Ward, Dann, Tomkins, Kelly; Flamini, Puncheon, Cabaye; Townsend, Zaha, C Benteke. Subs: Speroni, Campbell, Lee, Fryers, Mutch, Sako, Husin. Referee: Andre Marriner Happy new year! 366 days ago, Arsenal began 2016 top of the league, with Crystal Palace in fifth, four points off the top four. Things were looking up, but right on cue, the wheels came off. Arsenal finished 10 points behind Leicester, whose march to the title would have stung both these sides, for different reasons. There were small victories – member St. Totteringham’s Day? Member Pards dancing? – but while Arsenal sputtered and stalled, Palace put the whole thing in reverse, and six (SIX) league wins in the whole year meant Pards danced no more. He’s replaced by Sam Allardyce, another for whom 2016 was, to put it mildly, a bit of a mixed bag. Big Sam used to enjoy these tussles with Arsène Wenger, but hasn’t won a league game against Arsenal since his Blackburn days. It’s been an even longer wait for Palace – Whigfield was No1 the last time they took three points home from North London – Highbury to be precise, back in 1994. For both managers, both teams, and the rest of us, bleary and remorseful, today is the perfect time to start again. Kick-off is at 4pm GMT; teams to follow.','https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/jan/01/arsenal-v-crystal-palace-premier-league-live','Arsenal 2-0 Crystal Palace: Premier League – as it happened',55,'football'),('world/2017/jan/01/istanbul-nightclub-attack-dreadful-year-for-turkey','The New Year’s Eve attack on an Istanbul nightclub concluded a dreadful year for Turkey, during which the country was shaken by a failed military coup, a policy setback in neighbouring Syria and a string of terrorist atrocities. No group has yet claimed responsibility for Saturday night’s attack, but suspicion will fall on Islamic State. The group repeatedly struck at Turkish cities in 2016 in retaliation for Ankara’s support for international efforts to suppress its activities in Syria and Iraq. Given recent history, an extremist Kurdish nationalist group known as the Freedom Falcons, or TAK, could also be in the frame for the attack. It claimed responsibility for bomb explosions outside a football stadium in Istanbul that killed 45 people in December, and a car bomb attack in Adana the previous month. The TAK, a breakaway faction of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), says it is responding to a harsh crackdown by the army and police in Kurdish areas of south-eastern Turkey. The crackdown, which displaced thousands of civilians, followed the collapse in 2015 of a ceasefire between the PKK and the government of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Turkey’s president. In all there were several dozen serious terrorist attacks in Turkey in 2016, often targeting the police and army but just as often hitting civilians. Government officials have also pointed the finger of blame for some attacks at Syrian Kurds. They claim the Syrian Kurd People’s Protection Units (YPG) are allied to the PKK and share its aims of carving out autonomous Kurdish areas in Syria and Turkey. Turkey’s military intervention in northern Syria by ground and air in 2016 inflamed the situation. It was ostensibly designed to assist the fight against Isis. But Erdoğan’s main purpose in ordering the only direct Syrian intervention by any Nato member country was to contain the YPG’s territorial advances and prevent any linkup with the autonomous Kurdish areas of northern Iraq. This effort is still under way. The YPG were specifically excluded from the Syria ceasefire jointly brokered by Turkey, Russia and Iran last week. But it remains unclear whether Erdoğan’s effort will be successful. What is clear is that Erdoğan’s manoeuvrings have brought Turkey into conflict with its long-time ally the US, which does not not share Ankara’s view of the YPG as terrorists but sees them as useful anti-Assad fighters. US material and weapons support for the YPG provoked Turkish protests. Erdoğan’s intervention has also brought strains with Iran, Turkey’s historical rival dating back to the time of the Ottoman and Persian empires. Although both governments oppose Kurdish minority aspirations, Sunni Muslim Turkey resents Shia Iran’s increasing influence in Iraq and Syria and in other areas it views as within its traditional spheres of influence. Viewed overall, Erdoğan’s Syrian policy flopped badly in 2016. In the light of the Russian and Iranian-led battlefield successes, notably the fall of Aleppo, Erdoğan was forced to freeze his key demand that Assad step down. And having burned his bridges with Washington, he has also been obliged to throw his weight behind Moscow’s peacemaking efforts. But the assassination of Russia’s ambassador to Turkey in Ankara last month by a man shouting “Remember Aleppo” underlined how fragile the bilateral relationship – in tatters a year ago after a Russian warplane was shot down – remains. Domestically, an attempted army coup last summer almost succeeded in toppling Erdoğan. The wave of repression that followed including the jailing of thousands of alleged supporters of the exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen and a ruthless crackdown on the judiciary, academia and the media. Erdoğan has accused the HDP, the leading pro-Kurdish party, of supporting the PKK, and several of its leaders were detained. At the same time, he continued to push through constitutional changes designed to give him quasi-autocratic presidential executive powers. Meanwhile, attempts by Turkish officials to implicate the Obama administration in the coup attempt, because of its refusal to extradite Gulen, further strained ties with Washington. Erdoğan fell out simultaneously with the EU over sharp European criticism of post-coup human rights abuses. As the new year begins, Erdoğan appears set on strengthening his grip on power, by both democratic and undemocratic means, and pursuing his onslaught against the Kurds inside Turkey and in Syria. In a statement issued after Saturday night’s attack, he vowed to “fight to the end” against terrorists whose aim he said was to “create chaos and destabilise the country”. But Turks heard tough-sounding language of that kind from Erdoğan on too many similar occasions in 2016. More and more people may conclude that it is the president’s failed, divisive policies that must change if the carnage is to end.','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/01/istanbul-nightclub-attack-dreadful-year-for-turkey','Istanbul nightclub attack caps off dreadful year for Turkey',56,'world'),('football/2017/jan/01/middlesbrough-leicester-city-match-preview','Claudio Ranieri will want to see Leicester City capitalise on their solid win over West Ham.

The industry has come under the spotlight amid concern about its commitment to curbing problem gambling and fears about the influence that daytime TV adverts have on children. The increased scrutiny culminated in a government review of betting firms’ social responsibility, including controversial fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), often dubbed the “crack cocaine” of gambling for their addictive nature. The parliamentary register of members’ interests, which details the value of gifts and donations received by politicians, reveals that major bookmakers and horse racing firms quadrupled their efforts to entertain MPs ahead of the review. Politicians enjoyed the largesse of the gambling world on 33 separate occasions last year, accepting tickets worth thousands of pounds to racing and football events.They accepted nearly £20,000 of hospitality, including tickets to Ascot, the Derby and the Grand National. The two biggest beneficiaries were Conservative MPs Laurence Robertson, and Philip Davies, who was referred to the MPs’ ethics watchdog in 2013 over his links to the gambling industry. Davies accepted £4,720 of hospitality from the gambling industry in 2016, while Robertson enjoyed entertainment worth £5,166. On their basic salary of £74,962, it would take an MP nearly a month to earn enough to pay for £5,166 of hospitality out of their own pocket. Other notable recipients include former SNP leader Alec Salmond – who was given a badge worth up to £1,000 by the Racecourse Association permitting entry to certain racecourses – and secretary of state for international development Priti Patel. She was given two Grand National tickets worth £2,000 by Jockey Club Racecourses. The amount spent on MPs – during a year in which the threat of increased regulation has loomed large – was a major increase on 2015, when gambling and racing firms hosted MPs just nine times, to a total value of less than £5,000. A spokesman for the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, which campaigns for FOBT maximum stakes to be reduced from £100 to £2, said: “Those MP’s who accept the bookies’ free entertainment must surely realise what this is really about and why all of a sudden they are splashing the cash on them. “They are trying to garner what support they can for their £100-a-spin machines and stave off what looks like an impending clampdown by the government. “Our campaign looks forward to finding out where the 33 MPs who have accepted hospitality stand on the issue of the bookies’ addictive machines.” Last month Carolyn Harris, Labour MP for Swansea East, called for the maximum stake on FOBTs to be reduced in her capacity as chair of the all-party parliamentary group on FOBTs. She said: “Interestingly I’ve never been offered any hospitality, not that I would expect to be.” There is no suggestion that any of the named MPs have been unduly influenced in their decision making by gifts received. The UK’s booming gambling sector also continued to ramp up its spending on TV adverts. Excluding lotteries, gambling firms had spent £94.4m on TV adverts by the end of October, according to data analysis firm Nielsen, putting them on course to beat the£118.8m spent in 2015. Including lotteries and spending in the print media and billboards, betting firms had spent £211m by October, with figures for the full year not due to be released until February. The amount of gambling advertising on TV has triggered concerns among politicians and campaigners about the potential impact on children of daytime adverts for gambling, which are permitted alongside sporting events. The gambling industry also ramped up its lobbying efforts with the Back Your Local Bookie campaign, launched by the Association of British Bookmakers (ABB). The ABB tweeted about the campaign in mid-October, which coincided with the Department of Culture, Media and Sport launching its call for evidence on gaming machines and social responsibility. The campaign website includes an automated form that allows people to put their name to a letter to their local MP, worded by the ABB. It reads: “I’m tired of how bookmakers are constantly misrepresented, and I’m concerned about the impact of any further regulation on bookies. “Betting shops are closing at a rate of over 100 per year and with that local authorities are losing yet another business rate paying retailer from their high streets. And without bookies, our high streets will continue to suffer a decline in footfall. “The potential for further regulation will only hasten these closures. My local bookie is a sociable, fun meeting place, with great staff, and I want it to stay that way.”','https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/01/gambling-firms-charmed-mps-ahead-of-betting-review-in-2016','Gambling firms charmed MPs ahead of betting review in 2016',58,'business'),('commentisfree/2017/jan/01/the-day-violent-thugs-were-driven-out-by-hippes-with-glowsticks','Lily danced in the leaves while I spoke to a hippy from Turkey. He spoke of peace because he’d seen war. He talked about love because he knew hate; hate&nbsp;for those above him, hate for those he had served with, hate for enemies not born his but who became so, and lastly, hate for himself because of how his mind had been controlled. He talked about life and living because he had seen death, and been the cause of it. He had long hair because the army had forced him to shave his head. Now he had a beard. I liked my new bearded friend; his life until then had not been of his own making, but he was taking it back. I felt fuzzy and wonderful as the grey, abrasive side of life wobbled away to rainbow jelly as the acid kicked in. And then Lily was standing in front of me. The look on her face was out of the ordinary and I knew instinctively that something serious had happened. Lily looked vulnerable. I had never seen her look vulnerable. “A man on the dancefloor grabbed me. I’ve been sexually assaulted.” It was raining on her face but the sky was dry. “Do something!” My mind raced through a hundred thoughts in half a second. What are you going to do? You can’t fight. What if he knows any kind of fighting? You have to do something or your girlfriend is going to think you less of a man, but you also don’t want to get killed. You are on acid, you idiot. What are you going to do? Hug this guy to death? Talk philosophical nonsense about the nature of violence? I took Lily’s hand and we walked to the dancefloor and then up to the bar in search of the guy. I had no idea what I was going to do. This was my John Wayne moment, only I wasn’t a cowboy, a fighter or anything like John Wayne. I&nbsp;felt better by assuring myself that I had been beaten up before, and from what I&nbsp;remembered, it wasn’t that bad. The bar was busy with chatter, but there was a clear and unobstructed view&nbsp;from where Lily and I stood all the&nbsp;way to the bench where she pointed out the man in question, who sat laughing with four friends. Five thugs in&nbsp;total. Splendid. These guys were not dressed for a New Year’s Eve travellers’ rave in a jungle. They leered across the bar throwing judgmental daggers at the laughter and sparkles. They were trying&nbsp;to act like they needed to be perceived, so they stood out in a jungle full of hippies whose basic philosophy is&nbsp;to be yourself. The guy who “grabbed” Lily was bald, and violent around the eyes. He&nbsp;was thick with muscle, and so were his&nbsp;friends. I walked toward the men. They stared back. The man who had touched Lily pointed at me and laughed. He beckoned me to keep walking. He was enjoying the moment. I stopped. They stood. We waited. This was now a&nbsp;scene like in some action film, without the guns or hero. I needed&nbsp;to think of something fast, or I was walking towards a beating. I lifted my hand above my head, and shouted at the top of my voice: “I have something I need to say to everyone here and it’s very&nbsp;important!” A crowd of over 300 people at various states of enlightenment stopped what they were doing and looked at me. I walked up to the man sitting with his group of friends and pointed at him and said: “This man does not belong here. He is not part of the party. This man has just sexually assaulted my girlfriend on the dancefloor. He is not one of us. He is negative energy. If you see him, be on guard!” The guys stopped laughing and looked to the floor. They hid their faces. They stormed toward me. I was going to get hit in the face. The crowd, remarkably, jeered. The men stopped, now surrounded by many, unsure what to do. The fight was no longer five on one: this was five against hundreds. The few party people who hadn’t noticed the commotion now watched. A girl moved forward and yelled at the men to go. Another stepped forward and booed. Then everyone booed. The men stared at the crowd, then back at me with wild eyes. An angry mob had developed, of hippies yielding glow sticks. The circle parted, the men ran out of the circle, down the path, away from the bar and into the jungle. The man who had touched Lily stumbled as he ran, and as&nbsp;he hit the floor the crowd cheered. I had used peace to beat the thugs around the head. This New Year’s Eve taught me that if we just gather the strength to ask for help, the good are powerful, and fear does not have to be faced alone.

Richard Angell, of the centrist Progress group closely associated with the New Labour years, said it was his new year’s resolution to stop an amendment supported by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, which would lower the number of supportive MPs needed to qualify as a leadership candidate. Currently, would-be candidates need the support of 15% of their parliamentary colleagues for their name to be added to the ballot. However, the Labour conference this year will vote on whether to lower the threshold to 5% of MPs. The move is favoured by supporters of Jeremy Corbyn because it is viewed as an avenue to allow a continuity leftwing candidate to succeed him whenever he chooses to resign. The amendment was put forward by a local constituency group and does not need the formal backing of Labour’s national executive committee to be put to conference. An NEC source said they thought Labour delegates in their current political makeup would be unlikely to back such a controversial amendment at Labour’s next conference. Angell wrote in a blog for the Progress website: “This pitiful threshold not only belittles the idea of leadership, it is an anathema to Labour’s commitment to parliamentary socialism and to Britain’s parliamentary democracy. “Our system require the candidate to be prime minister to command overwhelming support on the treasury benches. The hard left’s amendment acknowledges that their candidate for leader will never command that kind of support.” Angell suggested McDonnell was keen to lower the threshold for nomination because he was eager for the chance to run for the leadership himself, though McDonnell has publicly denied this and said he will never stand for the leadership of the Labour party. The shadow chancellor recently tipped other members of the shadow cabinet to eventually succeed Corbyn, including the shadow business secretary, Clive Lewis, and the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner. A Labour source said it was clear both sides of the party would be mobilising long before conference. “Either way, it’s not a McDonnell amendment – that’s Progress trying to fire up their base,” the source said. The move to lower the threshold is backed by Momentum, the grassroots movement set up after the election of Corbyn, and the leftwing Campaign for Labour party Democracy group, of which Corbyn was formerly a member. Alice Perry, a member of Labour’s NEC, said party members focus should instead focus on getting ready to fight any snap general election. “The next Labour party conference is nine months away. A lot can happen in that time, including a possible general election,” she said. “We saw the political landscape shift dramatically in 2016, Labour’s priority has to be to respond to the new challenges we face, articulate our own compelling, positive vision for the UK’s future and fight every election 2017 has in store, including some very important local elections.” Meanwhile, Labour’s Brexit spokesman, Keir Starmer, has told the Sunday Times that he backs a “fundamental rethink” of free movement rules after the UK exits the EU – far stronger language than used by the party leader. “The rules on free movement have got to be changed or the way the rules operate has got to change,” he said. “People, when you talk to them about immigration, have a strong distinction in their mind between people who are coming here to work and contribute and those who are coming here to look for work, and I think that distinction is well worth exploring.” Corbyn has previously said he believes the pitfalls of free movement have been exaggerated, and expressed doubts that a work permit system could be fairly applied. Meanwhile the man vying to take over the country’s biggest trade union is expected to warn that workers will feel “betrayed” if Britain does not take control of its borders after it quits the European Union. Gerard Coyne, who hopes to oust Len McCluskey as general secretary of the Unite union will say the government should “not even begin to negotiate” over immigration as it attempts to thrash out a Brexit settlement. Coyne, Unite’s West Midlands regional secretary, will use a speech in Birmingham on Monday to say migration within the EU has benefited those who are better off by allowing them to hire low cost cleaners and nannies, but has put pressure on services and housing for many others.','https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/01/labour-members-urged-to-reject-plan-for-lower-leadership-threshold','Labour members urged to reject plan for lower leadership threshold',62,'politics'),('tv-and-radio/2017/jan/01/philip-saville-obituary','The director Philip Saville, who has died aged 86, was an important figure in British television drama – an innovative practitioner who brought Alan Bleasdale’s 1982 drama Boys from the Blackstuff to the screen. The series, which concerned the harrowing effects of unemployment on five Liverpudlian men, had a difficult gestation – the BBC was not easily persuaded to allow a supposedly “arty” director to convey the reality of the disenfranchised working classes. While he greatly admired Bleasdale’s scripts, Saville suggested rewrites, notably expanding the role of Angie, the wife of one of the men, Chrissie (Michael Angelis). This added a strong female element to an otherwise male-dominated piece and provided Julie Walters with a breakthrough role. One episode, Yosser’s Story, featured the broken Yosser Hughes (Bernard Hill) desperately asking “gissa job” as his sanity was eroded along with his self-respect. By shooting Yosser’s Story on film, Saville gave it a haunting grandeur (the other episodes benefited from the immediacy of being made entirely on videotape, unusual for the time). The series won the Bafta award for best drama serial. Saville was born in east London. His father, Louis – whose own father, Joseph Saffer, had anglicised the family name, appropriately adopting one related to his trade as a master tailor – was a travelling salesman for a clothing company. Philip’s mother, Sadie (nee Tanenberg, and known as Kay), was the supervisor of the women’s fashion department at Fortnum &amp; Mason in Piccadilly. During the second world war he attended several different schools, then began a science-based course at the University of London, and enrolled at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada). He was called up for national service and posted to the Royal Corps of Signals in Catterick, but was discharged following an accident with an armoured vehicle that badly damaged his knee. He spent some time in the US – studying Shakespeare, acting and directing – and then back in the UK in the late 1950s appeared in low-budget “quickie” films. Adept at electronics – he enjoyed fixing radios – he was then drawn to the new medium of television. Having directed the TV movie Curtains for Harry (1955), co-written by his wife Jane Arden (whom he had married in 1947) and Richard Lester, he joined ABC Television, for whom he would direct more than 40 episodes of Armchair Theatre (from 1956). Great technical skill was required to realise his ambitious visuals – the framing and camera angles – as many of these productions were live. His trademark was inventive use of the camera, and he sometimes used mirrors to create offbeat, beguiling imagery or otherwise unachievable shots. His intense 1960 production of Harold Pinter’s A Night Out was a breakthrough success for both writer and director, topping the week’s ratings. He also directed Pinter (and Arden) in Sartre’s In Camera (for the BBC’s Wednesday Play, 1964) and returned to its subject of existential angst in The Logic Game (1965). He could be a hard taskmaster, but won the respect of his crews because he always had the best interests of the production at heart and the results were of the highest quality. His visual experimentation worked in harmony with a keen intellectualism, and he pushed the envelope both technically and in terms of subject matter. Indeed Three on a Gas Ring (1959), about a unrepentant single mother who elects to bring her illegitimate child up on a houseboat with two other women, was never broadcast. The Independent Television Authority watchdog felt it might “encourage immorality and destabilise family values”. For The Madhouse on Castle Street (BBC Sunday Night Play, 1963), he flew in Bob Dylan, whom he had seen performing in New York City, to play the lead part. It soon became apparent that this would not work, so Saville split the role in two, hiring David Warner to do the acting while Dylan did the singing. In 1964, with Hamlet at Elsinore he broke new ground by recording the play entirely on location (with a Danish crew) at Kronborg Castle. Christopher Plummer was Hamlet, Robert Shaw Claudius and Michael Caine Horatio. Saville’s technically sophisticated BBC production of EM Forster’s The Machine Stops (1966) won the top prize at the 1967 Trieste international science fiction film festival. The Play for Today Gangsters (1975, by Philip Martin) mixed gritty urban realism with offbeat storytelling and spawned a successful spin-off series. Tall, handsome and urbane, Saville had a personal life that was as rich and vivid as his work. He and Arden separated in the mid-60s, but did not divorce. Saville’s affair with the pop artist Pauline Boty was said to have inspired the film Darling (1965). He and Diana Rigg lived together for some years from the mid-1960s. When preparing Count Dracula (1977, still regarded as one of the most faithful adaptations of Bram Stoker’s novel), he auditioned the actor Nina Francis. He did not cast her but eventually, in 1987, they married. After Boys from the Blackstuff, he won another Bafta (beating Dennis Potter’s The Singing Detective) for The Life and Loves of a She-Devil (1986). It was an effective retelling of Fay Weldon’s novel, as was The Cloning of Joanna May (1992). Later work included The Buccaneers (1995, a controversial adaptation of Edith Wharton’s unfinished novel), My Uncle Silas (two series, 2001 and 2003, with Albert Finney playing HE Bates’s character) and The Gospel of John (for the Canadian Visual Bible project, 2003). In 2009, his documentary Pinter’s Progress shed a personal light on the playwright, and latterly he taught aspiring actors at Rada. His feature film work included Stop the World I Want to Get Off (1966), Oedipus the King (1967), The Best House in London (1969), The Fruit Machine (1988) and Metroland (1997), with Christian Bale and Emily Watson . At the time of his death he was putting the finishing touches to an autobiography, provisionally titled They Shoot Directors, Don’t They? He is survived by Nina and their son, Waldo; by two sons, Sebastian and Dominic, from his marriage to Arden (who died in 1982); and by a daughter, Elizabeth, from another relationship. • Philip Saville, television director, born 28 October 1930; died 22 December 2016','https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/01/philip-saville-obituary','Philip Saville obituary',63,'tv-and-radio'),('tv-and-radio/2017/jan/01/planet-earth-ii-david-attenborough-martin-hughes-games-bbc-springwatch','David Attenborough’s blockbuster nature series Planet Earth II is “a disaster for the world’s wildlife” and a significant contributor to planet-wide extinctions, a rival natural history producer has claimed. The BBC programme concluded in December and drew audiences of more than 12 million viewers but presents “an escapist wildlife fantasy” that ignores the damage humans are doing to species everywhere, according to Martin Hughes-Games, a presenter of the BBC’s Springwatch. In a direct attack on Attenborough’s flagship series, which features a soundtrack by the Hollywood composer Hans Zimmer and became the most-watched nature programme in 15 years when it was broadcast last month, Hughes-Games said the makers had ignored evidence of mass extinction, most recently from the World Wide Fund for Nature and the Zoological Society of London, which reported last year that between 1970 and 2012 there had been a 58% decline in the abundance of vertebrates worldwide. “These programmes are still made as if this worldwide mass extinction is simply not happening,” he said. “The producers continue to go to the rapidly shrinking parks and reserves to make their films – creating a beautiful, beguiling, fantasy world, a utopia where tigers still roam free and untroubled, where the natural world exists as if man had never been.” The result is that Attenborough and others “are lulling the huge worldwide audience into a false sense of security,” he said. “No hint of the continuing disaster is allowed to shatter the illusion.” Attenborough, however, did use the series to make an impassioned plea for greater conservation. At the end of the final episode he spoke of “our responsibility to do everything within our power to create a planet that provides a home not just for us, but for all life on Earth”. He has also insisted that his programmes enable an increasingly urbanised global population to remain in touch with nature. “More people are out of touch with the natural world than have ever been,” Attenborough said at a press conference to launch the series in October. “But since we depend on the natural world, understanding it is absolutely paramount. Television can provide that link better than ever before, in some ways. Fifty years ago, there was hardly a species on [Planet Earth II] that anyone would have seen. Now everybody has. It’s remarkable, and it’s valuable.” The BBC declined to comment on Hughes-Games’s criticism that the impression of pristine wildlife Attenborough’s shows create was misleading. “Even as Planet Earth II was being broadcast, it was reported that elephant and lion numbers were tumbling, and last month it became clear that the giraffe could be heading towards extinction, with numbers plummeting by 40% in the past 15 years,” Hughes-Games said. There is, however, also evidence of improving fortunes for some species. Tiger numbers are thought to be increasing and the giant panda has recently been removed from the list of endangered species. Hughes-Games said he was not arguing that programmes such as Planet Earth II should not be made. He said “fantasy should be balanced by reality” and urged the BBC to commit to making more wildlife programmes that overtly address conservation. Hughes-Games proposed injecting conservation themes into TV dramas and children’s programming. He said: “As a matter of urgency, a ­development team should be set up to think how the reality of what’s happening to wildlife worldwide can be portrayed in ­innovative ways, integrated in dramas, in children’s shows – in collaborations with ­producers like Aardman Animations, perhaps, or video diaries of ­inspirational people working with animals.”','https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/01/planet-earth-ii-david-attenborough-martin-hughes-games-bbc-springwatch','Planet Earth II \'a disaster for world\'s wildlife\' says rival nature producer',64,'tv-and-radio'),('commentisfree/2017/jan/01/bbc-planet-earth-not-help-natural-world','It has been wonderful watching Planet Earth II. What a glorious, spectacular and fascinating series. Hats off to the production team, the camera crews, the film editors and the splendid music – and to David Attenborough himself for the marvellous commentary and script. We have surely never been so close to the action and never have the pictures looked so luxurious. I have the greatest admiration for the teams who made Planet Earth II – whose final episode was broadcast last night on the BBC – but I fear this series, and others like it, have become a disaster for the world’s wildlife. These programmes are pure entertainment, brilliantly executed but ultimately a significant contributor to the planet-wide extinction of wildlife we’re presiding over. The justification, say the programme makers, is that if people (the audience) become interested in the natural world they will start to care about the natural world, and will be more likely to want to get involved in trying to conserve it. Unfortunately the scientific evidence shows this is nonsense. For instance, the World Wide Fund for Nature and Zoological Society of London’s authoritative 2016 Living Planet Report has concluded that between 1970 and 2012 there was a 58% decline of vertebrate population abundance worldwide. This encompasses the period in which Attenborough’s outstanding natural history series have been broadcast (starting with Life on Earth in 1979). The prime factor in this destruction is humankind’s insatiable need for space – destroying and degrading habitat at an appalling rate – coupled with species over-exploitation, pollution, invasive species, climate change and rampant poaching. Yet these programmes are still made as if this worldwide mass extinction is simply not happening. The producers continue to go to the rapidly shrinking parks and reserves to make their films – creating a beautiful, beguiling fantasy world, a utopia where tigers still roam free and untroubled, where the natural world exists as if man had never been. By fostering this lie they are lulling the huge worldwide audience into a false sense of security. “If David Attenborough is still making these sorts of wonderful shows then it can’t be that bad, can it?” Yes it can, and it’s going to get much, much worse. Even as Planet Earth II was being broadcast, it was reported that elephant and lion numbers were tumbling, and last month it became clear that the giraffe could be heading towards extinction, with numbers plummeting by 40% in the past 15 years. But no hint of the continuing disaster is allowed to shatter the illusion. I’m not for one moment suggesting such shows should not be made. They are wonderful records of the beauty rapidly disappearing from our planet. I believe that in 100 years people will be amazed, and profoundly sad, that it was still possible to make such programmes. What I am suggesting is that the fantasy should be balanced by reality. I would like to propose a “conservation tax” among natural history commissioners across all channels. This tax would insist that a fifth of natural history commissions are significantly conservation-oriented. As a matter of urgency, a development team should be set up to think how the reality of what’s happening to wildlife worldwide can be portrayed in innovative ways, integrated in dramas, in children’s shows – in collaborations with producers like Aardman Animations, perhaps, or video diaries of inspirational people working with animals, and cartoon characters. Some shows could be overtly conservation-oriented, others more subtle – perhaps a detective drama where the villains are smuggling rhino horn or ivory. But why would any TV development team put effort into imaginative conservation programming when escapist productions are so successful – unless it were taxed? The BBC is in a unique position to work with a conservation tax. It could do this as part of its public service remit, without having quite the financial pressure and need for profit that independents and commercial producers do. It would also be a very positive initiative for the BBC to be seen to be doing. We cannot simply carry on producing escapist wildlife fantasy almost totally ignoring the manmade mass extinction raging around us.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/01/bbc-planet-earth-not-help-natural-world','The BBC’s Planet Earth II did not help the natural world | Martin Hughes-Games',65,'commentisfree'),('books/2017/jan/01/odes-to-hope-and-techno-poems-to-get-you-going-again-carol-rumens','1 Josephine Baker hits Brixton Patience Agbabi makes language swing as she imagines an encounter with the 1920s singer, dancer and political activist Josephine Baker in Brixton, London. It’s a double monologue shaped like a palindrome, or mirror-poem, in which the second stanza uses the same lines as the first, but in reverse.

Mind and body are old sparring partners, and their apparent argument gets a sharp new twist in this cleverly titled, deftly rhymed parable by Anne Stevenson. Both are tempted by “the naked abyss”. To turn away from death towards life is one of the great acts of courage. Indecision causes vertigo. If only we could ask our bodies to choose, there’d be no dilemma – every cell is hard-wired to shout: “Life, please!” Vertigo Mind led body to the edge of the precipice. They stared in desire at the naked abyss. If you love me, said mind, take that step into silence. If you love me, said body, turn and exist. From Poems 1955-2005, Anne Stevenson (Bloodaxe, 2004). Her most recent collection is Astonishment. 3 A miniature sun in every cup Perhaps suspicious of vulgar self-indulgence, the lyric muse tends to ignore the sense of taste. But this poem by Tomas Tranströmer, the Swedish Nobel prize-winner, defies the etiquette. Its grammar-dodging couplets invite us to sit with the poet in a cheerful, outdoor cafe on a spring morning. That “daylight dot of beneficent black” is like a miniature sun in every cup. And the coffee is not only delicious, but a spur to activity and inspiration. Sing caffeine Muse! Espresso The black coffee they serve outdoors among tables and chairs gaudy as insects. Precious distillations filled with the same strength as Yes and No. It’s carried out from the gloomy kitchen and looks into the sun without blinking. In the daylight a dot of beneficent black that quickly flows into a pale customer. It’s like the drops of black profoundness sometimes gathered up by the soul, giving a salutary push: Go!

Although the bird in this poem is generic, casually evoked as “the thing with feathers”, it somehow achieves a real presence. The small bird of Hope asks nothing, survives extremity and never ceases to sing “the tune without the words”. Paradoxically, this must be one of the most often-memorised poems ever written. “Hope” is the thing with feathers “Hope” is the thing with feathers -- That perches in the soul -- And sings the tune without the words -- And never stops -- at all -- And sweetest -- in the Gale -- is heard -- And sore must be the storm -- That could abash the little Bird That kept so many warm -- I’ve heard it in the chillest land -- And on the strangest Sea -- Yet -- never -- in Extremity, It asked a crumb -- of me.

In Praise of Arguing And the vacuum cleaner flew down the stairs like a song and the hiking boots launched themselves along the landing. And one half of the house hated the other half and the blinds wound themselves around each other.

But as the old, seedy-hotel sex-magic asserts itself, his refrain gradually becomes one of delighted celebration. “Am I embarrassing you? I’m in Paris with you” gets my award for Best Rhyming Couplet in Contemporary English Poetry. In Paris with You Don’t talk to me of love. I’ve had an earful And I get tearful when I’ve had a drink or two. I’m one of your talking wounded. I’m a hostage. I’m maroonded. But I’m in Paris with you. Yes I’m angry at the way I’ve been bamboozled And resentful at the mess I’ve been through. I admit I’m on the rebound And I don’t care where are we bound. I’m in Paris with you. Do you mind if we do not go to the Louvre, If we say sod off to sodding Notre Dame, If we skip the Champs Elysées And remain here in this sleazy Old hotel room Doing this and that To what and whom, Learning who you are, Learning what I am. Don’t talk to me of love. Let’s talk of Paris, The little bit of Paris in our view. There’s the crack across the ceiling And the hotel walls are peeling And I’m in Paris with you. Don’t talk to me of love. Let’s talk of Paris. I’m in Paris with the slightest thing you do. I’m in Paris with your eyes, your mouth, I’m in Paris with … all points south. Am I embarrassing you?

The image of the “separate knot” suggests both the umbilical cord and the casual kit of belongings tied together by an adventurous young traveller setting out. And now you exist outside the royal room of blood you occupied and – without being shown – can close a fist or yawn. Practised, you look already. Hopskip and bowing, treading measure in a dance. You only took to unfamiliar air with your first taste of dust yesterday as evening fell. All the falling, all the flow around you, hair and water, will become familiar: mother, father: skin-to-skin. You’ve swum the sea of welcome, been lifted on the swell, slipped waxy through the crowd of hands. Your own breath sounded the all-clear, all’s well, when you sang out a first exclamatory note about the cord that tied you being cut, the tying-off, your separate knot. From The Observances, Kate Miller’s debut collection (Carcanet, 2015). 8 Queen of my own universe If you’ve never won a race (or perhaps never even run a race) and worry you might have missed something special, sit back and enjoy Tracey Herd’s winning monologue. While Tomas Tranströmer discerned the sun in a cup of rich espresso, Herd finds it in the athlete’s gold medal, “like a tiny sun catching the last of the light”. The runner’s sensations are heightened and small details as deeply etched as the moment of victory on the speaker’s memory. What I Remember is not the race itself but the evening which disappeared in a tangle of diving sunlight and nerves as I hugged myself, chilled, and waited for the starter, bent forward, the tang of mown grass sprayed like water and the white lines freshly painted on the spongy red track, breasting the tape, alone and splendid, queen of my own universe, then the medal like a tiny sun catching the last of the light, and feeling as if my heart would burst. From Not in This World, Tracey Herd (Bloodaxe, 2015). 9 To bud and leaf again With this poem by Gillian Clarke we’re in the depths of the winter solstice. All the “golden ones” have come to dust, and greater threats than winter may be brewing “while the world talks,/ and the ice melts, / and the seas rise”. But the winter trees are preparing to bud and leaf again, challenging the irony of the last line’s “Promises. Promises.” The Year’s Midnight The flown, the fallen, the golden ones, the deciduous dead, all gone to ground, to dust, to sand, borne on the shoulders of the wind. Listen! They are whispering now while the world talks, and the ice melts, and the seas rise. Look at the trees! Every leaf-scar is a bud expecting a future. The earth speaks in parables. The burning bush. The rainbow. Promises. Promises. From Selected Poems (Picador, 2016). Gillian Clarke is a former National Poet of Wales. 10 Every day is Saturday Yorkshire poet Maurice Rutherford was born in 1922, the same year as Philip Larkin. Here, the writer-narrator pauses to savour some everyday gifts of wonder and pleasure. A linnet on the lawn, a ship outward-bound, and memories of classroom horticulture all remind the poet – and us – that “a place where/ every day is Saturday, and Saturday is Christmas” can be reached through the power of imagination. Poem on Saturday Outside my window, a linnet on the laburnum shows poetry to the other birds, preens, stutters its wings and corrugates away across the lawn, and the nest of words I am waiting to hatch goes cold. Yesterday, as from the office window I watched a vessel leave the lockpits, outward-bound for Genoa, slipping the tugs from the task in hand, my feet were treading Italian ground before the Humber had healed in her wake. I knew, once, a tall school window high above the tiers of desks, where, in carbolic air, peas imprisoned in a jar strove for the sky and begged me join in their climb to a place where every day is Saturday and Saturday is Christmas. From And Saturday is Christmas: New and Selected Poems (Shoestring Press, 2011).

My science teacher once told me I wasn’t good enough for science and look at me now.” In the 1970s and early 80s Rubin, who has died aged 88, established that the stars in the outer regions of galaxies move at similar speeds to those in the middle, a result that led to the hypothesis that most of the universe is invisible, the cosmos filled with “dark matter”, mysterious stuff whose nature is still unknown. During recent years she became a popular favourite for a Nobel prize, but never received the accolade. Having battled sex discrimination throughout her career, she became an inspiration for women in science. In the outer regions of the solar system, far away from the sun where the force of its gravity is more feeble than hereabouts, planets move more slowly than the Earth. Were Uranus to move as fast as us, it would escape from the solar system entirely, its centrifugal thrust too large for the weakened inwards gravitational pull from the sun. This has been understood since Isaac Newton in the 17th century, and is a cornerstone of Einstein’s general relativity: bodies orbiting a central mass will have speeds that fall in proportion to the square root of their distance from the centre. Many galaxies of stars form spirals, where relatively few stars in the outer arms orbit around a dense mass of stars at the centre. Here too, the laws of gravity imply that the outer stars should move relatively slowly compared to those nearer the central mass. But when Rubin mapped the motion of stars in spiral galaxies, she discovered that, far from slowing with distance from the centre, they moved at similar speeds, or even travelled faster the further out they were. Rubin’s results implied that the galaxies are rotating so fast that they should fly apart. Either Newton’s law of gravitational attraction, and by implication Einstein’s general relativity, form an incomplete description on cosmic scales, which would be truly revolutionary, or there are vast volumes of unseen matter that provide additional gravitational grip on the stars. This unseen stuff has become known as dark matter – dark in that it does not shine in the electromagnetic spectrum at any wavelength. The concept of dark matter has become one of the most exciting insights into our place in the universe. Where Copernicus removed the earth from the centre of the universe in the 16th century, and the discovery of galaxies in the 20th century showed our sun and Milky Way to be mere bit players in the cosmos, Rubin’s discovery seemingly implies that matter, as we know it, consisting of atomic electrons, protons and neutrons, is but flotsam on a vast sea of dark matter. Current estimates are that dark matter outweighs our stuff by a factor of five to 10. So, following Rubin’s breakthrough, we now believe that we are not even made of the same stuff as most of creation. Vera was born in Philadelphia, younger daughter of Philip Cooper, an electrical engineer, and Rose Applebaum, who worked for the Bell Telephone Company. The family moved to Washington DC when Vera was 10, and it was there that she developed an interest in astronomy. She was attracted to Vassar College as an undergraduate because Maria Mitchell, the first American to discover a comet, had worked there. After gaining a BA in astronomy in 1948, her first choice for graduate school was Princeton, but she never received the graduate prospectus, as women were not admitted to the graduate programme until 1975. Instead she joined Cornell University. At Cornell in 1948 she met Robert Rubin, a fellow graduate student, whom she married. Following a master’s at Cornell in 1951, she completed a doctorate at Georgetown University in 1954, where she studied the motion of galaxies. Edwin Hubble had discovered that galaxies are on the average rushing apart from one another, the key to the theory that the observable universe is the result of a big bang some 13.8bn years ago. Rubin’s thesis in 1954 showed that galaxies are not distributed uniformly throughout the universe, but tend to cluster and rotate around one another. Rubin became an inspiration for women in science, especially, and further afield. She had four children, and most of her early career as an astronomer was part-time, so that she could be at home by the time the children returned from school. All four of her children later gained doctorates in mathematics or the natural sciences. In 1964 Rubin became the first woman to use the Palomar Observatory in southern California. Her first discovery there was that it did not have toilet facilities for women. She returned to her office, cut some paper into the shape of a skirt and stuck it on the image of the person on the toilet door. It was at Palomar, in a series of papers during the 1970s and early 1980s, that she made her most famous discoveries. She became a staff member at the Carnegie Institute of Washington in 1965, and it was with a young Carnegie colleague, Kent Ford, that she determined the distribution of mass in spiral galaxies by measuring their speeds of rotation. Among many honours, she was a member of the US National Academy of Sciences, won the gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society – the first woman to have done so since Caroline Herschel in 1828 – and asteroid 5726 Rubin was named after her. She received several honorary doctorates, including one from Princeton University half a century after having been barred from their graduate programme. Her husband died in 2008, and her daughter, Judy, in 2014. Rubin is survived by three sons, Allan, David and Karl, five grandchildren and a great-granddaughter. • Vera Florence Rubin, astronomer, born 23 July 1928; died 25 December 2016','https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jan/01/vera-rubin-obituary','Vera Rubin obituary',67,'science'),('football/2017/jan/01/everton-southampton-match-preview','Ronald Koeman endured a miserable return to St Mary’s Stadium in November when his current side were outmanoeuvred and beaten by his old one but fatigue may work in Everton’s favour this time around.

He scored one try and was denied another by a wing Jones selected ahead of him, Jack Nowell. “It was like Harry Potter had given him his cloak of invisibility,” said the Exeter head coach, Rob Baxter. “We couldn’t lay a hand on him.” It was Nowell, though, who collected the man-of-the-match award after the Chiefs, 11-0 down and looking out of it after an hour, staged a remarkable comeback, winning at the Rec in the league for the first time through the replacement wing James Short’s two tries in the final seven minutes. Nowell was involved in the second, looking as if he would make it to the line before being tackled by Tom Homer. When Exeter moved the ball left, Gareth Steenson defied another Homer challenge to pass the ball through his legs and it bounced kindly for Short to cross unopposed and condemn Bath to their first home defeat of the season. The performances of Rokoduguni and Nowell explained England’s initial selection. For all his menace with the ball in hand and his ability to confound defenders by stepping round them as well as going through them, the Bath wing was less polished in defence and was caught out for Exeter’s first try. As Luke Cowan-Dickie juggled with the ball after George Ford had tried to dislodge it after the hooker had got through two tackles, Rokoduguni was drawn towards him and out of position when the ball was slipped to Short, who shrugged off the wing’s challenge to score. Nowell, in contrast, made his tackles count in an all-round display of excellence. Rokoduguni looked certain to score after catching his own chip from 60 metres and getting close to the line before the Exeter wing brought him down and turned him on his back to prevent the ball being grounded. After the interval, he thwarted another move sparked by George Ford, who from Sunday is free to talk to other clubs as he ponders a move away from Bath, and brought Jonathan Joseph to ground as the centre anticipated breaking into space. “I am finally getting back into my stride,” said Nowell, who missed the autumn internationals through an injury sustained in England’s October camp in Brighton. “Rob Baxter had a few words to say to us at half-time because we had slipped off tackles and in the second half we took it to them. “Rob has put a lot of pressure on us in the last couple of weeks because in past seasons we have tended to drop off around the Christmas period, but we followed our victory over Leicester with success at Bath and we can look forward to going to Saracens next weekend.” Bath’s director of rugby, Todd Blackadder, was left to reflect on an impressive attacking display that yielded a mere bonus point after the loss of three props with head injuries, including Nathan Catt who had little more than an hour before been named in England’s squad, left them a player short in the final minutes as they were forced to go to uncontested scrums under rules designed to stop teams getting battered up front feigning injuries. Bath are struggling to find four fit props for Friday’s trip to Newcastle and will be without their No8 Taulupe Faletau, who has suffered the recurrence of a knee-ligament injury, for a month after which he will join up with Wales for the Six Nations. Zach Mercer deputised against Worcester and the 19-year-old stood out with his footwork, off-loading and anticipation. “All three props stayed off the field through the safety protocols in place and it is something that needs to be looked at down the line,” said Blackadder. “We were really clinical up to the hour mark [when Nick Auterac became the third prop to leave with a head injury] and while Exeter hung in there and all credit to them, it was a frustrating defeat.” Ford had been at his impish best in that hour, helping Bath outwit opponents who ended the afternoon leapfrogging them into third place in the table. Asked if he had lined up a replacement outside-half, Blackadder said: “We have a few irons in the fire but it depends what George’s decision is. It would have to be someone of high quality if George is to leave us.” Bath T Homer; Rokoduguni, Joseph, Tapuai (Clark, 78), Brew (Watson, 52); Ford, Fotiuali’i; Catt (Auterac, 19; Van Vuuren, 61), Dunn, Lahiff (Knight, 32), Garvey (Stooke, 62), Attwood, Ellis, Louw (Grant, 65), Z Mercer.

His time in London started well but then came a match at Old Trafford in which Gary Neville roughed him up a bit: “I’m not going to deny an element of intimidation. Reyes couldn’t handle the rough and tumble.” He didn’t score again for four months, never reached his former heights and left in 2006. 2005 Jean-Alain Boumsong, Rangers to Newcastle, £8.2m Rangers owned Boumsong for only six months, in which time his value somehow increased from free to more than £8m. “He has a great desire to be the best,” said Graeme Souness, and the manager remained loyal to the blunder-prone centre-back for as long as the board were loyal to him, a little over a year. Six months after that the Frenchman was sold for a near-£5m loss. “When I’m good, nobody talks about it,” he complained. “All right, I’m no Beckenbauer but with time I’ve figured out what I can do and what I can’t.” One list, sadly, was much longer than the other. 2006 Hossam Ghaly, Feyenoord to Tottenham After 16 months and 17 league starts, Ghaly came on in the 29th minute of a game against Blackburn, was taken off again in the 60th, tossed his shirt at Martin Jol on his way off the pitch and threw away his Spurs career in an instant. That summer Birmingham bought him for £3m but they found a way to cancel the deal after he fell out with Steve Bruce inside three days. He nearly played for Spurs again in January 2009, when he was named on the bench, but fans booed him so furiously he was sold to al-Nassr within weeks. 2007 Julius Aghahowa, Shakhtar Donetsk to Wigan, £3.5m As the end of January 2007 approached Wigan were bottom and on a run of eight successive league defeats. “There’s no disguising it – we’re in the shit,” surmised their manager, Paul Jewell. Enter Aghahowa, a fleet-footed Nigerian whose acrobatic goal celebration had made him one of the breakout stars of the 2002 World Cup. Paul Jewell insisted the club had “really done our homework on this one” and that he had “watched him personally on two occasions”. Wigan’s fans didn’t see much more of him: a little over a year, three managers, a total of 23 appearances and not a single goal after his arrival he left again. 2008 Afonso Alves, Heerenveen to Middlesbrough, £12.7m In 2006 Manchester City signed the hapless Greek striker Georgios Samaras; in 2014 Cardiff spent £2m on Magnus Wolff Eikrem, who played nine times before having his contract cancelled; and in 2008 Middlesbrough spent nearly £13m on Alves. All three players were bought from Heerenveen, a club that should be avoided at all costs by spendthrift English chairmen. Alves scored 48 goals in 50 appearances in the Netherlands; he had a few (approximately two) good days in his season and a half in England, before he turned up late to pre-season training in the summer of 2010 and Boro swiftly sold him at a £6m loss. 2009 Savio Nsereko, Brescia to West Ham, £9m West Ham boasted that they had beaten off “fierce competition” for the German striker, player of the tournament in the European Under-19s Championship the previous year. What followed was a period in which, by his own admission, the player “lost grip on reality”. He certainly lost grip on his first-team place, starting once before the season ended and immediately being offloaded to Fiorentina at a loss of over £6m. He never played for the Italian side, enduring a series of failed loans that included one at 1860 Munich, cancelled when he went missing for a week before being discovered in his sister’s house, and another at Juve Stabia when he disappeared to Thailand and allegedly faked his own kidnapping. 2010 Michel, Sporting Gijón to Birmingham, £3m Halfway through the month this was still the biggest deal completed by any Premier League club. His new manager, Alex McLeish, announced that the Spaniard “is in a great age group and has got good legs”. Less encouragingly, the Scot also revealed he would probably come to “realise he might have a problem getting into the team”. And so it transpired, with the arrival of Craig Gardner a few days later pushing him from third-choice central midfielder to fourth. He eventually started six games, and tasted another six as a substitute, before being sold to Getafe for half the price they paid for him. 2011 Jean Makoun, Lyon to Aston Villa, £6m This was the January of Januaries, the greatest ever top-flight transfer splurge. Torres and Carroll tend to hog the limelight, leaving forgotten disasters such as Tottenham’s £1.5m move for Bongani Khumalo (“He’s got potential, he’s not expensive and we like him,” said Harry Redknapp. “He’s desperate for a chance, and we’re going to give him a chance.” No they weren’t: four and a half years and not a single first-team appearance later they released him on a free transfer). Still, Makoun stood out among the more big-money, high-profile humiliations. “He’s exactly what we need,” said Gérard Houllier after the deal for the midfielder was completed. Turns out he wasn’t: seven league games, three bookings and a red card later he was gone. 2012 Marvin Sordell, Watford to Bolton, £3.2m Owen Coyle hijacked Sordell’s mooted move to Cardiff in a last-minute deadline-day intervention, and in the remainder of the season gave him three substitute appearances, all away from home, two lasting less than 10 minutes. The following season Sordell started the first three games and then hardly played until February, an absence his new manager, Dougie Freedman, blamed first on the player’s mental state – “He’s homesick, there isn’t even a fancy word for it” – and then on his refusal to disconnect from social media. “He’s got small issues off the field with his tweeting. It could be bordering on an obsession.” He left for Burnley after 30 months and 13 starts. 2013 Vegard Forren, Molde to Southampton, £4.2m The Norwegian defender pulled out of a trial with Liverpool when Southampton agreed terms with Molde and declared the move “a dream come true”, insisting he was no Forren mercenary. “There’s no doubt that this is where I want to be,” he beamed. “There is a good, young squad here and the way they play fits me well.” Not for long it didn’t. On the very day his transfer was completed Southampton sacked Nigel Adkins and replaced him with Mauricio Pochettino. That summer, no appearances later, his agent declared his player was “patient, ready and committed” to the Southampton cause. Three weeks later he returned to Molde. 2014 Kostas Mitroglou, Olympiakos to Fulham, £12.4m In the first half of the 2013-14 season Mitroglou had scored 14 goals in 12 league games and a Champions League hat-trick, while Arsène Wenger described him as “a true finisher who can’t be ignored”. It turned out he could be ignored: in the second half of that season, following his switch to Fulham, there was one start, two substitute appearances, a couple of knee injuries and no goals. He wasn’t helped by the fact that René Meulensteen, the manager who signed him, had been replaced by Felix Magath by the time he made his debut; that summer he went back to Olympiakos on loan. 2015 Andrej Kramaric, Rijeka to Leicester, £9.7m On 7 January 2015, the day they completed the club-record signing of the Croat, Leicester were bottom of the league with three wins in 20 games. None of their subsequent success can be accredited to a forward who scored twice in his first half-season under Nigel Pearson, after which Claudio Ranieri arrived, announced that he was “a fantastic player but at this moment I choose another kind of striker” and proceeded to give him only 22 minutes’ action. The player insisted that “fans are sorry I do not play. They are very fond of me”, though given their team’s results they might just have been delirious. A year after his arrival, he departed for Hoffenheim on a loan that became permanent for an undisclosed fee. 2016 Oumar Niasse, Lokomotiv Moscow to Everton, £13.5m Roberto Martínez acclaimed Niasse’s “real hunger and desire to be successful” but still picked him to start only two league games. Of the 13 remaining matches between his arrival and the end of last season he was active for just 19 minutes, 14 of them in a game against West Ham in which Everton were 2-0 up when he came on, and 3-2 down at the final whistle. He has no squad number for this season, though he’s had a few games for the under-23s, whose manager, David Unsworth, thinks the striker is “outstanding”, that “his work rate has been incredible” and that he “needs to carry on what he’s been doing”. Namely, not much.','https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/jan/01/january-transfer-window-worst-signings-michael-ricketts-oumar-niasse','The worst January transfers every year since the winter window started | Simon Burnton',70,'football'),('music/2017/jan/01/sound-of-speed-athletes-and-amateurs-on-the-art-of-the-running-playlist','The playlist: ‘Diana Ross got me singing at the top of my voice’ Music critic Alexis Petridis on how to find the right jogging tunes Before I started running, lots of people gave me advice, and all of it turned out to be true. Yes, I found running weirdly addictive. Yes, it provided me with a sense of mental equilibrium: I felt better physically, but also psychologically. Yes, the runner’s high is a real thing: a euphoric, fleeting rush of endorphins that feels remarkably like being on fantastic drugs, without the comedown. But they never mentioned music, which in retrospect seems odd. Among the pleasures of running – right up there with mental equilibrium and smug self-satisfaction – is the bizarrely intense relationship I feel with whatever I’m listening to. Perhaps it has something to do with running putting you in a heightened, more receptive state; perhaps with the fact that you often concentrate intently on what’s coming out of your headphones to keep your mind off how knackered you are. Whatever it is, it’s powerful. Songs have vaulted out of nowhere into my all-time-favourites list as a result of listening to them while I run. In some ways, it’s the aspect of running I look forward to the most, the thing that can get me out of the house when it’s cold or wet or I just don’t feel like it. Certainly, I think music is too important a part of running to leave to others to control, although if you want to do that, there are plenty of options. Streaming services, still engaged in the faintly creepy task of trying to second-guess what you want to listen to, have acres of curated and continually updated exercise playlists: “Go harder, better, faster and longer with these motivational EDM tracks. Yes, you CAN do it. You got this”; “The sound of sweatspiration … train hard and reap the rewards with a rootsy, motivating mix.” These descriptions alone largely motivate me to go back to bed and pull up the covers – and that’s before I even get to the music. In fairness, there’s a pretty wide representation of genres on offer – “fast folk and aggressive Americana, guaranteed to push your workout to the max” offers one playlist, chillingly – but the vast majority appear to have been compiled by people steadfast in the belief that what you really want to listen to when you’re exercising is awful pop-dance or terrible, shouty, I-didn’t-ask-to-be-born-mum nu-metal. If that’s your thing, fill your boots. But I’ve got a feeling that, regardless of your tastes, you might be better off making your own running playlists than relying on algorithms. Whatever genre you opt for, I’d go for a mix of new stuff, heavily laced with stuff you have at least some familiarity with: for some reason, I find the moment of happy recognition when a track you know and love kicks in gives you a quick energy boost. People seem to fuss about the tempo affecting how you run: there are playlists on which everything is around 170bpm, based on precisely this logic. But I’ve never found that it matters. I’ve run really fast and really well – by my standards, at least – while listening to late-70s and early-80s soul that was laid back to the point of sonnambulence. More affecting than speed is the tenor of the music. Given that the runners’ high usually seems to kick in after 40 minutes, I’d strongly suggest loading that part of your playlist with music that might intensify this, although there are potential downsides to doing that, not least the spectacle you can make of yourself if you get carried away: I speak as a man who was once spotted by a friend running along the A23, in the throes of endorphin-induced euphoria, singing along to Diana Ross’s I Ain’t Been Licked at the top of my voice, a sight said friend described as both “deeply upsetting” and “impossible to erase from my memory”. The motivator: ‘We finish at a club for a beer and a dance’ Tim Jonze finds that the right coach can help in unlikely ways “Music is fundamental to what we do,” says Greg Drach, co-founder of the exercise group Midnight Runners. “It’s a legal performance-enhancer.” Midnight Runners stage mass runs through the city streets after dark, with some joggers lugging boomboxes so everyone can listen to the same playlist. “People run at different speeds, so music helps keep the group together,” says Drach. “Plus you can’t hear your own breathing as much.” Building exercise playlists can be less scientific than you might think. Drach says he started out picking Spotify playlists that adhered to a suitable 160-180bpm, but this didn’t always work out. “A lot of songs were terrible for running,” he says. “They just felt wrong, didn’t get you pumping.” Instead he opted for a more instinctive approach, and it turns out that being a music fan with an ear for a tune is essential, no matter how big the operation. Gillian Reeves, national group exercise manager at Virgin Active Health Clubs, says instructors spend hours sorting playlists, with the company even building a specialised platform from which to create them, using a constantly updated library of 50,000 tracks. “One of the reasons participants come back,” she says, “is that they like your selection. It can transform exercise, which may seem tedious, into a theatrical, emotive experience.” Chris Stanton, who runs The Pack spin classes at Virgin Active, says factors like bpm can be important when you want your class to find an extra gear – he tries to match the music to the required revolutions-per-minute during hill climbs, for instance. But Reeves and Stanton both tend to look beyond the numbers and, depending on the class, follow some simple rules: pick songs in which the verse and chorus provide natural intervals for you to catch your breath; use acoustic tracks to cool down as they provide less stimulation for the nervous system; make sure any lyrics complement the motivational atmosphere you’re trying to create. “Songs about sad times or breakups aren’t the best,” says Reeves. The playlists Midnight Runners and Virgin use are pretty familiar. Both opt for subtlety-free EDM and chart-pop remixes with huge, arm-waving choruses: Avicii, Clean Bandit, Calvin Harris and DJ Snake feature on their more intense workout playlists, though Drach says he likes to throw in the occasional classic (“so people can all sing along”). Reeves, meanwhile, occasionally pays tribute to a legend: “Earlier this year there were a lot of Prince tracks around the time he passed, in homage to such an inspiring artist.” Clearly, the point isn’t to make sure your muscles are straining in tandem to a robotic rhythm, but rather to ensure you’re having fun. Indeed, Midnight Runners time their 11.30pm runs to finish at a party location, so that the exhausted runners can grab a recovery beer from the bar and shift the workout to the dancefloor. The Olympian: ‘Beyoncé as a pick-me-up, the Weeknd to chill out’ Dina Asher-Smith, 100m and 200m British record-holder, Olympic and World Championship bronze medallist, and history student Whether I am about to race in an Olympic final or the first heat of the British indoor championships, my choice of music will be designed to balance out what I am feeling. So if I am nervous, I’ll put on something soothing. But if I’m tired – if it’s day five of the Olympics and I need energy from somewhere – I’ll listen to something that picks me up. I know the level of arousal I need to be at my best. Music helps me get into that zone. In the past, I’ve tried being really hyper before I compete – it doesn’t work. I’ve also tried being really calm – again, it doesn’t work. You have to be somewhere in the middle. So I have a bunch of playlists. If I need to chill out, I’ll listen to the Weeknd, slow R&amp;B and old skool classics – TLC and stuff like that. If I want to pick myself up, it’s Beyoncé, grime, Jay Z, Kanye West – stuff that is empowering and gets you thinking. Unlike many athletes, I don’t listen to music when I’m training or warming up. Yes, rhythm is really important. But when I run, I have to feel the patterns of what I’m doing without accompanying music – because when you race, you don’t have Jay Z pounding out on the track with you. That said, sometimes I will put my headphones on with no music. I know it sounds funny, but it is like a symbol of being in the zone. It’s like: “I need my own space here.” Otherwise, you get people saying: “Hey!” That’s fine 99% of the time but not when there’s an Olympic medal on the line. Sometimes if I’m cold when training in the winter, I’ll also use my headphones as earmuffs! I’m currently in the final year of a history degree at King’s College, London, so when I am writing an essay I will always listen to Classic FM, as its music keeps me focused without distracting me – most of the time, there are no words to sing along to. I’m going to write my dissertation on jazz in 20th-century America. Until recently, I didn’t listen to much jazz – I chose the topic more because of the race relations and interaction with popular culture. But once I started getting into it, I realised it’s the foundation for so much else.

Nothing has stunted its potency and growth, not the 7/7 bombings or the 2011 riots, not Black Monday or the 2008 global crash, not even the original Millennium Dome. Its economy drives and subsidises the rest of the country, its still-new tier of regional government – the mayoralty and the Greater London Authority (GLA) – has been a success and it has hosted a triumphant Olympic Games. Its population, after shrinking through years of managed decline, is now at an all-time high, and might hit 10 million by 2030. But London enters 2017 with a question mark after its name. Might its golden age be coming to an end? After the fireworks, the New Year begins amid unaccustomed unease. The heavy, grey cloud above is Brexit, with major employers in an international city whose wealth has been built on financial services pondering their options for the future. Meanwhile, austerity, albeit moderated by Miliband-ish measures from Theresa May, continues to erode from below. It doesn’t lighten the general mood that armed police officers have become a routine feature of everyday London life. In all these circumstances optimism is essential, but staving off its opposite will require fortitude and skill. The mayor, of course, has a big part to play in all of this. Sadiq Khan’s 2017 will involve the Labour man in unending nagging of and negotiating with the Conservatives in charge of national government, hoping to secure the best possible post-Brexit deal for the capital and, by extension, the country. His panel of Brexit advisors, bankers, accountants, Peter Mandelson and all, doesn’t delight those who think he’s insufficiently left-wing. But pragmatism is an essential mayoral art: if you want a bunch of Tories to take you seriously, you don’t surround yourself with Corbynites. Policy delivery will begin with Khan hailing a freeze on those public transport fares that Transport for London (TfL) sets, but not the universal one some of his election campaign statements and a line in his manifesto claimed. Political opponents will attack him (again) for that, and for the demands he is making on TfL’s finances as a whole as his first mayoral budget, covering all GLA functions, comes under closer public scrutiny. Khan’s new “hopper” fare, which enables bus passengers to catch two buses for the price of one during a 60 minute period, has given him - not to mention a lot of Londoners on low incomes - a quick early win. But this initiative, though welcome, needs to be seen in the context of falling bus ridership, something TfL can ill afford given its increasing dependence on fares revenue. This, in turn, is a consequence of worsening road traffic congestion, which London’s economy could do without. Congestion also harms air quality, another issue the mayor has sought to make a fast start on. He is set to kick-off implementing his anti-pollution policies by introducing an emissions surcharge (the so-called “T-charge” on toxicity) on high-pollution vehicles entering the congestion charge zone early in 2017, but will be urged by critical friends to go further with his policies as a whole. Holding down public transport fares is one part of a broader attempt to address London’s high cost of living, which leaves too many of its households, including around 40% of its children, struggling to make ends meet on unacceptably low pay and excluded from many of the city’s riches. Housing costs are, famously, a huge factor in this and also hugely difficult to control. The mayor’s housing team has assembled a purposeful strategy for getting more homes built for sale, rent or a combination of both at prices ordinary Londoners can afford. Khan will hope to be able to boast of initial successes as he embarks on the vast task of trying to better match housing delivery to the city’s social and economic need. The backdrop to all this is the ongoing three-year monster mission of writing a new London Plan. There are going to be tensions. Hammered by successive grant cuts and hampered by limits on their freedom to borrow to build, some of the capital’s boroughs, often Labour-run, are becoming ever more adroit at finding ways to meet at least some local “affordable” housing demand, but these can mean private sector partnerships involving publicly owned land that don’t always work as well as planned. The available alternatives - largely, small variations on doing nothing - aren’t all that attractive either. Squeezed between the same rock and hard place we find shortages of school places and health and social care provision also having their impact at borough, and indeed neighbourhood level. Dynamic boroughs and the mayor alike are trying to get more more purchase on low-cost childcare and improving post-school skills training, as the city strives for greater autonomy in the running of its affairs.

A second away win by this margin in four days could not have been more convenient preparation for Chelsea’s visit to White Hart Lane on Wednesday and any suggestion that they might take their eye off the ball against opponents with previous for inconveniencing bigger names was quickly rendered unnecessary by the sheer paucity of Watford’s offering. It is hard to imagine that a home side will play this inadequately during the rest of 2017. Injuries had played havoc with Walter Mazzarri’s plans, but that does not completely excuse the sluggishness and basic errors that peppered the performance of a relatively experienced starting XI. Tottenham were merciless in response and seized upon the home side’s repeat offences, the snatched clearance from Younès Kaboul that teed up Dele Alli to score a third goal – and end any lingering doubts over the outcome – four minutes before half-time providing a faithful snapshot of the afternoon’s events. None of that is to detract from the encouragement Tottenham, whose four-game winning run gives the impression of a team easing into gear after a patchy autumn, will take from a match they controlled entirely. Alli, recapturing last season’s levels of effervescence, was a delight to watch and Mauricio Pochettino will have been equally happy that he could rest his midfielder for the last third of the game. Harry Kane looked as sharp as at any time this season and then there was the performance of Kieran Trippier, who has been a forgotten man due to the excellence of Kyle Walker but took advantage of his team-mate’s suspension to lay on both of Kane’s goals. He remains one of the division’s most technically gifted right-backs and this was a reminder that Spurs possess important depth in what, for them, is a vital area of the pitch. Trippier had already created a chance for Danny Rose when, spotting Kane’s angled run in the inside-right channel, he met it with a clever pass round the defence. Kane beat Heurelho Gomes confidently and from then on it was a question of how many Tottenham would score. Six minutes later it seemed anyone’s guess. Trippier’s next trick was a wonderful, half-volleyed cross from the right flank that bypassed the home centre-backs for Kane to jab home emphatically. Watford players were not without reproach, Kane showing far more hunger than the two he beat to the ball, but the delivery had been virtually unplayable. It was a perceptive, first-time switch across field from Alli that supplied Trippier with the time and space to centre. That was entirely characteristic of the midfielder’s performance, which could have been crowned by a spectacular goal when a 25-yard shot rapped the bar seconds before Kane opened the scoring, but was still rewarded soon enough. Alli was deft, alert, brain and feet operating yards ahead of anybody in a yellow shirt. Craig Cathcart might have prevented him from seizing on to Kaboul’s mistake, but this was a day when 50-50 contests had only one winner and his finish was unerring. There was a similar outcome when, found with half of the penalty area at his disposal from Kane’s cross 58 seconds into the second half, Alli was faced with Gomes a second time. The result was the same and had the option been available, both sides would surely have wound things up there and then. Watford’s supporters had booed after the third goal but saw the rest of the game out as quietly as their team. Much as Kaboul’s scrambled injury-time consolation was insignificant, it was a jolt to the senses inasmuch as they had never threatened anything of the sort. “We were growing during the season and then out of nowhere we miss five very important members of the team,” said the Watford manager. “If you took that number from any other team in the Premier League they would also be in big difficulty.” Mazzarri had said before the game that he needed “a priest” to rid Watford from a litany of problems that had included early injuries to Daryl Janmaat and Valon Behrami in the Boxing Day draw with Crystal Palace. Nobody with access to a higher power appeared to have listened; Watford were forced into a reshuffle when Camilo Zúñiga suffered an ankle injury in the warm-up and that set the tone for their afternoon. Zúñiga’s replacement, Odion Ighalo, went on to underline the sense that the form with which he began 2016 was very much against the norm. The task for Tottenham is to make sure that this level of performance becomes a regular occurrence against better opposition. “It was nearly a perfect game,” Pochettino said, and more of the same against the leaders on Wednesday would give the next 51 weeks a tough act to follow in improving on this first one.','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/01/watford-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report','Tottenham’s Harry Kane and Dele Alli provide double trouble for Watford',75,'football'),('football/2017/jan/01/sunderland-liverpool-match-preview','Liverpool have won their past four matches, the most recent of which was against Manchester City.

PS Join Niall McVeigh for Arsenal v Crystal Palace, or else. I have your IP address. Don’t call it a comeback. Watford get a goal in added time, with Kaboul sliding in a free-kick at the second attempt after a brilliant save from Lloris. 90 min A bit of olé football from Spurs takes us into added time. They’ve scored eight goals away from home in five days; not bad preparation for Wednesday’s humdinger at home to Chelsea. 87 min The tempo is much slower now. Spurs are content to pass the time rather than try to score a fifth. 84 min A well-worked free-kick from Watford releases Kaboul on the left of the box, and his volleyed cross is acrobatically claimed by Lloris. That’s the first significant thing he’s had to do in the match. 82 min Janssen screams with pain as Cathcart plants studs onto the top of his foot. Cathcart is booked. 80 min “Hey Rob, here’s my review of the year,” says Kevin Smith. “Manager of the Year: obviously it’s Bob Bradley. Hands down. I mean, just look at Swansea - 8 of 33 points (24%) with him, 4 of 24 (17%) without him. “Player of the Year: Scott Arfield, because it’s nice to have a Canadian in the premier league again. “Disappointment of the Year: Sticking with the Canadian thing, the lack of consideration Christine Sinclair gets for women’s player of the year. More international goals than anyone other than Abby Wambach (and she’s only 19 back), led Canada to a 2nd Olympic bronze as well as a domestic title, she’s still never finished higher than 5th in voting, and this year will be at best 4th. The top 3 includes Marta and Carli Lloyd, neither of whom got a medal in the Olympics, with Marta only scoring one goal (a penalty) the entire tournament.” 79 min Watford’s final substitution: Capoue off, Christian Kabasele on. 78 min Spurs make their final substitution: Kane off, Vincent Janssen on. 77 min Son continues to not score. First the last man Doucoure makes a vital interception; then Son lashes a bouncing ball over the bar. 74 min Amrabat winces his way off the field to be replaced by Jerome Sinclair. 73 min Amrabat bumps Wanyama over while protecting the ball and then collapses himself in the comedy style. He’s going to go off. 70 min The youngster Mason does well to deny Son a shooting chance after a fine long pass from Wimmer. 68 min A substitution for each side. Watford bring on the teenager Brandon Mason for Jose Holebas, who is on a yellow card, while Spurs introduce Ben Davies for the ever excellent Danny Rose. 67 min Trippier is continuing, though he doesn’t look particularly comfortable. He fell awkwardly after a challenge with Holebas. 66 min Trippier is struggling with a shoulder injury and might need to go off. 64 min “The fear,” says Peter McLeod. “Sure, we’ll always have it, and with good reason. It was super Spursy to qualify for the Champions League, book Wembley for our home matches and then go and lose the first two. But we need to have some perspective. Back in the late 90s Spursiness consisted of trying to copy Arsenal by getting a fancy foreign manager, then watching as Wenger racked up Doubles while Christian Gross almost got us relegated. Some fans complain about the Levy era but it’s been a dream compared to what came before.” 63 min Prodl is booked for a foul from behind on Son. 61 min Dele Alli is substituted with Chelsea in mind. He played beautifully, scoring twice and smashing a long-range shot off the bar. Harry Winks replaces him. 59 min Deeney, put through on goal by Prodl, is erroneously flagged offside. Morally speaking, it’s now Watford 1-4 Tottenham Hotspur. 58 min “Hai Rob!” says Arief. “I’m watching Spurs in Klaten, Indonesia now. What do you think are the chances of Harry Kane surpassing Thierry Henry’s 59 goals in first 100 appearances in the second half?” Ordinarily I’d say it’s unlikely but with the way Watford are defending he could easily get the 58 goals he needs. 57 min “Agents Kabul and Gomes seem to have done their job, not forgetting Capoue who is joining in by being totally invisible,” says John Tumbridge. “Surely now is the opportunity to get Carter-Vickers on and see how he is in the Premier League and Janssen in the hope it will bounce off his backside and he can score without requiring a penalty.” 56 min Kane curls it low around the wall, and Gomes gets down smartly to his left to push it wide. I think it would have hit the outside of the post anyway. 55 min Capoue commits an offensively brainless foul on Rose 20 yards from goal. Eriksen usually takes free-kicks but Kane is on a hat-trick... 53 min Here’s Mark Turner. “Manager of the Half Year: Allardyce. You want entertainment? Big Sam got your entertainment. Player of the Half Year: Hazard. Nailed on. Can’t even think of a jokey alternative. Disappointment of the Half Year: John Stones still being taken seriously as a defender.” 52 min Son slices wide of the near post after another fine move. I assume Spurs will declare soon, with Wednesday’s match against Chelsea in mind, but for now they look like scoring every time they attack. 49 min Doucoure’s low cross finds Deeney eight yards out with his back to goal, but he dithers and loses possession. 48 min “I was very disappointed when the FA deemed Big Sam too spicy but then the Premier League is more fun with him so let’s say he’s my pick for manager,” says Phil Podolsky. “Best player? Always liked that Yaya fella.”  What, Sanogo?  Dele Alli makes it four after 58 seconds of the second half. It’s another shocker for Watford. Prodl gives the ball away to Kane, who crosses to find Alli in his own personal postcode at the far post. He takes a slightly heavy touch but gets to the ball before Gomes and slides it under him with his left foot. 46 min “Following here in Vadodara, India, rooting for my Spurs,” says Rich Zumkhawala-Cook. “Is Trippier playing as well all over the pitch as he is in attack?” The moment he has any defending to do, I’ll let you know. 46 min Peep peep! Spurs begin the second half. “I’ll see your 3-4 and raise you a 3-5,” says John Dalby. I didn’t like to mention that. No team deserves to be reminded of being terrorised by Juan Sebastian Veron. Matt Loten’s half-year awards “Manager of the Half Year: Tony Pulis, because not even West Brom fans seem to give this man the love that he deserves. Not sure about his financial nous, mind, but I’m choosing to keep off-field issues out of my decision. Player of the Half Year: Zlatan Ibrahimovic. To do what he’s doing, at his age, in ‘this league,’ is nothing short of astonishing. Context: The last Manchester United player to score 16 goals before Christmas was a 26 year-old Ruud van Nistelrooy. Disappointment of the Half Year: Crystal Palace doing away with stripes for their home kit. It’s just wrong, I tell you. If Norwich were still in the top flight, though, it’d be their third kit.” Half-time reading (optional, encouraged) And the scoreline flatters Watford. See you in 10 minutes to see how many more Spurs can get. 45 min Spurs know better than most about the dangers of a 3-0 half-time lead. I think they’ll be okay today though. 44 min Holebas is booked for a bad tackle on Eriksen. This could end up a darts score. Kaboul mishits a clearance across his own box, Alli beats Cathcart to the loose ball and slides it calmly under Gomes. Spurs have been entirely magnificent today. 40 min “If you need some space and time filler, how about if we choose our mid-season award winners?” says Hubert O’Hearn. “My idea so I get to go first: Manager of the Half Year: Has to be Conte. Player of the Half Year: Diego Costa. In large part this is why Conte is Manager of the season - he’s transformed the little ball of hate into the best striker in the Premier League. Disappointment of the Half Year: Leicester’s title defence ... but we love them anyway.” Was Leicester a disappointment? It was pretty predictable. I agree with the first two. My main disappointment of the half year? Alton Towers. 39 min Son misses a great chance to make it 3-0. He met Eriksen’s inswinging free-kick on the volley, 10 yards out, but slid it fractionally wide of the near post. 36 min Wanyama places his studs down the back of Amrabat’s leg, which gives Watford a free-kick. It lobs around the box for a bit until Alderweireld mistimes a header back towards his own goal. Deeney looks set to score until Kane appears to clear the danger. Who does he think he is, Roy Race? 35 min I bloody love this Spurs team. There is so much to admire about them. Two goals for Kane, two assists for Tripper. This time he produced a sensational right-wing cross, larruping it into the six-yard on the box on the half-volley, and Kane muscled his way between two defenders to volley into the net. That is a brilliant goal. 32 min “A Spurs fan mate of mine is at Cheltenham races this afternoon,” says Mark Turner. “I’m busy winding him up, so far told him that Watford are 2-0 up via an Alderweireld own goal and a Guedioura screamer. Will happily take suggestions for Chapter 3 of the wind-up (at some point he’ll check the interwebs and the fun is over). Happy New Year, Rob.” Better still, tell him Spurs are 1-0 up and playing brilliantly. If that doesn’t give a Spurs fan the fear, I don’t know what will. 30 min Spurs are rampant. Alli’s majestic scooped pass over the defence almost puts Kane clear, with Prodl making a desperate and vital challenge. Seconds after Alli hits the bar, Kane gives Spurs the lead. Trippier, on the right wing, played a clever pass around the defence to put Kane through on goal, and he calmly placed it over the diving Gomes. 27 min Alli hits the bar with a brilliant rising drive from 25 yards. It was moving away from Gomes all the time and clattered off the bar. A goal is coming... 25 min Two of Tottenham’s centre-backs almost combine for a goal in open play. Alderweireld drives an angled pass over the top of the defence to put Dier clear. He has the chance to loop a header over Gomes, lurking in no-man’s land, but instead tries to head down to a team-mate and the chance goes. Moments later, Eriksen rifles just over the bar from 20 yards. Gomes had it covered. 24 min “I’m out there,” says Richard Wood. “Getting your coverage from Middleton, south Australia. Can we get Mike Dean in to give that penalty?” He’s not actually the referee today, though such semantics needn’t be an impediment to him awarding a couple of penalties for shirt-pulling. 23 min Eriksen’s square pass is dummied neatly by Alli, allowing Rose to maraud onto the ball, control it with his left foot just inside the area - and then splatter a right-footed shot miles over the bar. 21 min 20 min This game is not very entertaining. 16 min Anyone out there? 14 min Watford haven’t got going at all in attack. At the other end, Kane wallops a 30-yard shot not too far wide of the far post. Gomes knew it was going wide and didn’t make an attempt to save. 10 min Spurs are beginning to control the match. Rose’s cutback finds Eriksen, whose hopelessly mishit shot slams off the outstretched hand of Capoue and behind for a corner. Some referees would have given a penalty there. That said, Eriksen’s appeal might have been an attempt to distract attention from the fact his shot was going approximately four miles wide of goal. 8 min Amrabat is a bit lucky not to be booked for a clumsy hack at Rose. 7 min Eriksen finds Son in space, 25 yards from goal. He moves infield and curls a decent left-footed shot that is comfortably held by the sprawling Gomes. 4 min Both sides have started busily, though nothing of note has happened. You’re welcome. 2 min Both teams are playing a back three, a formation that has come back from the dead in recent years. There are no right and wrong tactics, only fashionable and unfashionable ones. 1 min Watford kick off from right to left and welt the ball straight out of play. Happy new year! Here come the players. It’s a grim day in Watford, with rain pelting down. Watford have had to make a last-minute change to their team: Juan Zuniga is injured so Odian Ighalo comes in. The first email of 2017! “I trust Messrs Kaboul, Capoue, and Gomes won’t forget that without their time at Spurs they would not now be playing for Watford,” says John Tumbridge. “They all have much to be grateful for.” Is gratitude a legitimate defence in match-fixing cases? Some pre-match nostalgia Watford (3-5-2) Gomes; Kaboul, Prödl, Cathcart; Amrabat, Capoue, Guedioura, Doucoure, Holebas; Ighalo, Deeney. Substitutes: Pantilimon, Sinclair, Folivi, Kabasele, Mason, Stewart, Rowan. Tottenham Hotspur (3-5-2) Lloris; Dier, Alderweireld, Wimmer; Trippier, Eriksen, Wanyama, Alli, Rose; Son, Kane. Substitutes: Vorm, Carter-Vickers, Davies, Dembele, Winks, Sissoko, Janssen. Referee Michael Oliver. Hello, happy new year one and all. Whether in 2016 or 1900, Watford haven’t generally had the best of times against Spurs. Their list of defeats includes 7-0, 8-1, 5-0, 7-1, 6-3, 5-2 – not to mention 4-1 in the famous 1987 FA Cup semi-final. It’s 23 years since they last beat Spurs – and even that meant the square root of bugger all, because a 3-2 win in the second leg of their Coca-Cola Cup tie didn’t quite compensate for a 6-3 shellacking in the first leg at Vicarage Road. That was then and this is now. Watford are an awkward side to face on their home soil - ask Manchester United, Everton and Leicester – but Spurs are an awkward side to face anywhere. They have only lost twice in the league all season and looked close to their exhilarating best in trouncing Southampton 4-1 last Wednesday. All told, this should be a good way to start a new year. Bloody better be because I’m in no mood for another 2016.

The official purchasing managers’ index slipped from 51.7 in November to 51.4 last month, compared to forecasts in a Reuters poll of a figure of 51.5. A reading above 50 indicates that the economy is growing. A year ago the index was at 49.7, and the start of 2016 saw global markets spooked by worries of a severe slowdown in the world’s second largest economy, but since then it has been slowly recovering. A housing boom in the second half of 2016 and a government spending spree on infrastructure have helped boost prices for commodities, from cement to steel, giving the country’s manufacturing sector a much-needed lift. But the government is cracking down on speculative property buying, and signals from policymakers that more will be done to contain asset bubbles and rising debt – even at the expense of slower growth – suggest extra stimulus measures could be limited. “[These] PMI figures suggest that the change of policy tone has taken its toll, as the authorities are seriously concerned about the asset bubbles,” said Zhou Hao, senior economist at Commerzbank. Factory output slowed in December, with the sub-index hitting 53.3 compared with 53.9 the previous month. Total new orders were flat at 53.2, logging the same as in November, while new export orders fell to 50.1 from 50.3. Jobs were again lost, with the employment sub-index sitting at 48.9, compared to 49.2 in November, as the country pledged to cut excess capacity over a range of industries. The Markit/Caixin PMI, a private gauge of manufacturing activity which focuses more on small- and mid-sized firms, is due on 3 January. A separate reading on the services sector showed the pace of growth slowed in December. The official non-manufacturing PMI stood at 54.5 in December, down from 54.7 in November, but still well above the 50-point mark.','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/01/chinese-manufacturing-purchasing-managers-index-housing','Chinese manufacturing sector expands for fifth consecutive month',78,'business'),('football/2017/jan/01/wilfred-ndidi-leicester-city-genk-transfer','They’ll miss Wilfred Ndidi – aka the teddy bear – in Genk. A combative character on the pitch; a shy, warm and grateful personality off it. During a team-building session an unsuspecting Ndidi once walked miles with a backpack stuffed with flowers after he left the zipper open. Behind him, all of his team-mates were laughing. For two years he had been their favourite victim but they all loved him because he was such a likable person. A charming guy who, having agreed to join Leicester City this month for £15m plus £3m in potential add-ons, leaves only good memories behind. A heart-winner, a ball-winner. The first person to fall in love with him? Roland Janssen, nowadays scouting for Manchester United in Belgium but formerly Genk’s head of scouting. In September 2013 Janssen was sitting on the sidelines of a pitch, somewhere in Nigeria’s biggest city, Lagos. Ten football academies from all over the country were taking part in a tournament. Flanked by scouts from Anderlecht and Villarreal, Janssen watched with full attention. More than 250 players gave the best of themselves but there was one he couldn’t take his eyes off: a 16-year-old, lanky defender from Nath Boys. Wilfred Ndidi. “He immediately caught my attention,” Janssen would recall in the Brussels newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws. “Before the final he played a game with his academy against a first division team from Lagos. The composure he had on the ball was atypical for an African player of that age. “Usually, when they know that European scouts are watching them, they want to prove themselves too much. They dive into tackles at knee height. He didn’t. He passed out from the back and, on a bad pitch, he launched some good long balls. A solid performance for a boy, who played against guys who were five-to-10 years older than him. He was only 16 but you could see his presence on the pitch.” Janssen decided to arrange a trial in January 2014. The selection criteria for trial players were very strict in Genk – foreigners should be much better than the players coming through the youth ranks. The club had nurtured Kevin De Bruyne, Thibaut Courtois, Yannick Carrasco and Divock Origi. Ndidi, a son of a soldier, travelled to Belgium to train with the development squad, managed by Domenico Olivieri, a former Genk captain who had won the Belgian title and a cup with them. “My first impression of him? I didn’t have that feeling: ‘Wow, this is a super talented guy,’” Olivieri has said. “Not a player we had to sign immediately but one worth following. His jumping ability was phenomenal but in the passing exercises he was struggling a bit. After an exhibition game against Maastricht I changed my mind. That was the first time he gave me the impression he could become a top player. He thrived in ball-winning. His long legs were everywhere. Octopus-like. He was open-minded, too. He immediately integrated in the group, was open for advice and his work ethic was outstanding.” There was a problem at that point. Genk could not sign Ndidi as clubs are not permitted to give a contract to non-EU players under 18. They had to wait a year, forcing Janssen to stay in touch with the player through email. “He was very impatient,” Janssen recalled. “He really wanted to come to Genk.” Ndidi also called Olivieri, who later told Het Laatste Nieuws: “A month after his trial I suddenly get a call from a number with an unknown foreign country code. It turned out to be Ndidi. He wanted to thank me for the opportunity he had been given. ‘Great,’ I thought. At that time he did not know that we would give him a contract. It was the first time that a trial player called me to say thanks. But that’s his personality.” In January 2015 the then head coach, Alex McLeish, and director of football, Gunter Jacob, decided to sign Ndidi and give him his first professional contract. The player finally moved to Belgium. “We were having a meeting with Gunter and Roland, our head scout,” McLeish later said. “There was no money left. We had to sell players before we could sign on new ones. Roland spoke highly of a kid he’d seen in Nigeria. We had to act quickly, he said. He showed me a video. Although you couldn’t draw many conclusions out of those images, I had a feeling that the boy had something in him. Eventually Genk paid £78,000 for him. My only transfer turned out to be a good one.” Only a month after Ndidi signed his contract, he made his full debut for Genk. He wasn’t ready but an injury crisis forced McLeish to play him as a left-back against Charleroi on 31 January 2015. “I still remember he had cramps after 70 minutes,” McLeish said. Under Belgium’s complicated end-of-season system, Genk did not qualify for Play-off I, the round that decides which team will be champions. It was a huge blow for the club but it turned out to be a blessing for Ndidi. In Play-off II a lot of youngsters got their chance for Genk and Ndidi was one of them. He made a good impression in central defence. McLeish’s contract did not get extended but Ndidi sensed an opportunity and returned to pre‑season in top shape. Aged 18, he scored excellent marks in the physical tests, leading to the new manager, Peter Maes, coming up with a special plan for the player. “Sergej Milinkovic-Savic would leave for Lazio, Bennard Kumordzi was injured, so I was looking for a defensive midfielder. I noticed he [Ndidi] had tremendous stamina. Ideal for my midfield. He would be my perfect guardian. We have many players who like to play the ball but he would bring balance to the team. And his passing skills were good enough, too.” Ndidi shone in his new role, hoovering up balls like a vacuum cleaner. “But he can read a game too,” Maes would add. “Remarkable for a boy of 19.” Maes often compared him to the way Yaya Touré, who moved from the Ivory Coast to Belgium as a teenager, developed at Beveren. “This boy can reach the European top,” he said with utter conviction at the beginning of the year. Ndidi had won over everyone in the club: the board, the staff, the fans and his team-mates. Scouts from top clubs were now also keeping an eye on him. Chelsea sent one and Leicester scouts also became regulars at the Luminus Arena. A good campaign in the Europa League convinced the Premier League champions to throw his name on the table in their pursuit of a successor to N’Golo Kanté. In the group stages of the tournament, Ndidi made more tackles and interceptions than any other player and Leicester moved swiftly to tie up a deal for him at the start of last month. They paid what Genk wanted and what represented a jackpot for the club, given they signed Ndidi for £78,000 two years ago. Maes, the man behind that remarkable rise, was sacked at the end of last month. After his last game, against Gent, Ndidi wanted to say a special word for him: “What will I remember from my period in Genk? Peter Maes. He made me a better player. He was hard on us but he wanted to get the best out of me. I will always miss the way he was barking at me.” Genk’s loss is Leicester’s gain.','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/01/wilfred-ndidi-leicester-city-genk-transfer','Wilfred Ndidi will be more than just a new ball-winner for Leicester',79,'football'),('world/2017/jan/01/cornwall-refugee-group-raises-thousands-pounds-resettle-syrian-families','A refugee support group in a small Cornwall town hopes to welcome two Syrian families after raising thousands of pounds. Bude Welcomes Refugees, a 30-person group based in the north Cornwall seaside resort, wants to be one of the earliest adopters of the community sponsorship scheme to resettle refugee families. The initiative enables community organisations, including charities, faith groups, churches and businesses, to take on the role of supporting resettled refugees in the UK. The group has applied for charity status and presented its plan to Cornwall council for approval, which is required to secure Home Office clearance. Richie Heard has been volunteering in an old RNLI lifeboat to save migrants and refugees attempting the crossing from Turkey to Greece. He said the initiative showed “just how much love this part of the country has to give”. The lifeguard, 32, who lives in Hartland, Devon, said: “I think it’s great, I think it’s lovely, and the fact that it’s coming to Bude ... There are so many people I know that would love to come out and jump on that boat, and do what I do and help in such a dramatic way, I feel very lucky to have the skills and the opportunity to do it. “But it’s given a lot of people here a great way to directly help these refugees who are coming across. I know so many people that have just dropped what they’re doing and started to raise money for these two families. And people here just absolutely can’t do enough to help. I haven’t heard anyone cast a negative opinion on this scheme that’s running. “There’s obviously going to be one or two people with a snide comment, but I think that’s born of ignorance. I think if you put most of these people in front of that Syrian family and asked them to judge again, they’d soon change their opinion.” The group has raised more than £12,600 for the first of the two families it hopes to offer homes to, which will cover the cost of interpreters, English lessons and top-up fees for local authority rates paid for private accommodation. All organisations hoping to take part in the government scheme must be either registered charities or community interest companies, and have the consent of the local authority in which they wish to operate and a comprehensive plan for resettlement. Sponsors under the scheme provide housing for the refugee family, as well as helping them integrate into life in the UK and access medical and social services, arrange English language tuition and support them towards employment and self-sufficiency.','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/01/cornwall-refugee-group-raises-thousands-pounds-resettle-syrian-families','Cornwall refugee group raises thousands to help resettle Syrian families',80,'world'),('sport/2017/jan/01/ronda-rousey-lebron-james-ufc-amanda-nunes','Ronda Rousey has received support from fellow high-profile athletes after her first-round defeat to Amanda Nunes on Friday night. Rousey who, along with Conor McGregor, is UFC’s biggest draw was beaten in 48 seconds during her comeback. But Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James showed sympathy after her defeat. “In sports, in general, they build you up as high as they can, put you on the highest mountain in the world, just to tear you down. That’s coming from somebody who has experienced it,” James told the Akron Beacon Journal on Saturday. “That’s a fact. I know exactly how she feels because I was that athlete. I went through that.” James was heavily criticized after he left the Cavaliers to join Miami Heat, where he won three NBA titles. He won another title with the Cavs in 2016. LA Lakers legend Kobe Bryant also defended Rousey. “Instead of clapping for @RondaRousey defeat give her a standing O for putting the sport on the map #pioneer #muse,” he tweeted. Jon Jones, another UFC star currently facing adversity, also offered his thoughts on Rousey’s situation. “My advice to Ronda would be to pick yourself up and try again,” Jones wrote on Twitter. “I think it’s important for Ronda to show her fans how great she truly is by displaying her courage and giving it another try. “What she does next will truly determine her legacy. I really hope she chooses to be unbroken. Her story doesn’t have to be over here. I also still believe she beats 90% of the division. Lots of ass kicking still to be done, lots of money to be made.” Jones, the former UFC lightweight champion, is currently serving a one-year doping suspension. Rousey, meanwhile, says she is taking time to consider her future. “I want to say thank you to all of my fans who have been there for me in not only the greatest moments but in the most difficult ones. Words cannot convey how much your love and support means to me,” Rousey said in a statement to ESPN. “Returning to not just fighting, but winning, was my entire focus this past year. However, sometimes – even when you prepare and give everything you have and want something so badly – it doesn’t work how you planned. I take pride in seeing how far the women’s division has come in the UFC and commend all the other women who have been part of making this possible, including Amanda. I need to take some time to reflect and think about the future.

In remarks to reporters upon entering a New Year’s Eve celebration at his Mar-a-Lago estate on Saturday night, Trump warned against being quick to pin the blame on Russia for the hacking of US emails. “I just want them to be sure, because it’s a pretty serious charge,” he said. “And if you look at the weapons of mass destruction, that was a disaster, and they were wrong.” US intelligence officials have said that they are confident Russia was behind the US election hacks, which could have played a role in Trump’s defeat over the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. On Thursday Barack Obama announced tough measures against Moscow, including the expulsion of 35 diplomats and the closure of two compounds in the US. Russia chose not to respond in kind, prompting Trump to tweet praise of President Vladimir Putin, whom he called “very smart”. The Washington Post also reported on Friday that Moscow could be behind malware found on a laptop owned by a Vermont electricity utility. In response to that discovery, the Vermont governor, Peter Shumlin, said: “One of the world’s leading thugs, Vladimir Putin, has been attempting to hack our electric grid, which we rely upon to support our quality of life, economy, health, and safety.” At Mar-a-Lago, Trump said: “I think it’s unfair if we don’t know. It could be somebody else. I also know things that other people don’t know so we cannot be sure. “And so I want them to be sure. I think it’s unfair if they don’t know. And I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove. “So it could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don’t know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation.” Asked what that information included, the president-elect said: “You will find out on Tuesday or Wednesday.” He did not elaborate, although in a statement released on Thursday in response to Obama’s sanctions, he said he would meet intelligence officials. Trump has long questioned reports of Russian attempts to influence the election in his favour, saying hacks could have been perpetrated by China or lone hackers, and repeated a desire for the country to “move on”. On Saturday, he went on to say “no computer is safe” from hacking and suggest that using a pen and paper was the most effective way of exchanging information. “If you have something really important, write it out and have it delivered by courier, the old-fashioned way, because I’ll tell you what, no computer is safe,” he said. “I have a boy who’s 10 years old, he can do anything with a computer. You want something to really go without detection, write it out and have it sent by courier.” Trump also left open the possibility of meeting with Taiwan’s president if she visits the US after he is sworn in on 20 January. “We’ll see,” he said when pressed on whether he would meet Tsai Ing-wen if she were to be in the country at any point after he became president. Tsai will be in transit in Houston on 7 January and again will be in transit in San Francisco on 13 January. Beijing bristled when Trump, shortly after his 8 November victory, accepted a congratulatory telephone call from the Taiwanese leader and has warned against steps that would upset the “one-China” policy China and the US have maintained for decades. Talk of a stopover in the US by Tsai has further rattled Washington-Beijing relations. Trump spoke to reporters for four minutes before entering the new year party, where guests included Sylvester Stallone and the model Fabio and for which invites had been sold at prices reported to be up to $575. Aides rejected claims that the sale of tickets could constitute the sale of access to the president-elect and his family. Earlier in the day, after issuing a new year message via Twitter in which he sent love to “my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don’t know what to do”, Trump ditched his press pool to play golf at one of his clubs. He was reported, by Politico, to have thrown a biographer off one of his courses on Friday. Trump has not held a formal press conference since July.','https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/01/donald-trump-unfair-blame-russia-election-hacking-interference','Trump questions claims of Russian hacking: \'I know things others don\'t\'',83,'us-news'),('music/2017/jan/01/allan-williams-obituary','In 1960, the Liverpool entrepreneur Allan Williams arranged for a fledgling group, the Beatles, to undertake a residency at a club in the red light district of Hamburg. It transformed the way they played and set them on a course that was to change popular music. Williams, who has died aged 86, later fell out with the band, leaving the field clear for the record store manager Brian Epstein to become their manager. Williams warned Epstein to have nothing to do with them. He became known as “the man who gave the Beatles away”, and he would recount his experiences in pubs, clubs and Beatle conventions and, indeed, to anyone who would listen. He was a superb raconteur, who undoubtedly embellished his tales, but never out of self-interest – it was simply to make his remarkable tales even more entertaining. Williams was born into a Welsh family in the Liverpool suburb of Bootle. His father, Dick, was a joiner who also promoted concerts. When Allan was still young, his mother, Annie (nee Cheetham), died giving birth to twins, who also died, and it was some years before Allan learned that the person he called his mother, Millie (nee Twigg), was actually his stepmother. On leaving school, he worked as a plumber, and in his spare time sang as a tenor with the Bentley Amateur Operatic Society, where he met Beryl Chang, a domestic science teacher, in 1953. They married two years later despite encountering hostility from both their families to a mixed-race marriage. Keen to follow the London trend for teenage coffee bars, Williams opened the Jacaranda in Liverpool in September 1958. Some students at the nearby art college, including Stuart Sutcliffe, were asked to paint the toilets and provide a mural for the cellar. Sutcliffe was then a guitarist with the Beatles, and the band made early appearances at the Jacaranda. When Eddie Cochran and Gene Vincent played the Liverpool Empire in March 1960, their British manager, Larry Parnes, agreed to organise a one-off concert at Liverpool Stadium with Williams that May. Cochran was killed in a road crash in April, so Williams added local groups to the bill, but not the Beatles. He did not consider them good enough. After the concert, Parnes asked Williams to organise an audition for potential backing groups for his artists. As a result, the Beatles went to Scotland for a week to back the singer Johnny Gentle. As they had no drummer at the time, Williams found them a stand-in, Tommy Moore. Moore hated John Lennon’s sarcasm, however, and on returning to Liverpool decided to stay with his job at Garston Bottle Works. Williams had a share in the New Cabaret Artists’ club, a strip joint in Liverpool, and booked the Beatles to accompany a Manchester stripper for a week. When he sold the venue, he and his partner, a calypso singer called Lord Woodbine (Harold Phillips), went to Amsterdam and then Hamburg to assess the club life. At the Indra in Hamburg, Williams heard a German band attempting rock’n’roll and told the club’s owner, Bruno Koschmider, that he could supply Liverpool bands to do a better job. He recommended the Beatles, not because they were good but because they were available – they did not have day jobs. A few weeks later, Williams was with another Liverpool group, the Seniors, at the 2i’s coffee bar in London and found Koschmider there, looking for “the Peetles”. As a result, the first Liverpool band to play in Hamburg was the Seniors, with the vocalists Derry Wilkie and Freddie Fowell (later better known as Freddie Starr). Koschmider wanted more. Howie Casey, the Seniors’ saxophonist, told Williams not to send “that bum group, the Beatles” because of their inexperience. Williams and Beryl drove the Beatles to Hamburg. The band did well but fell out first with Koschmider, when they moved to a rival club, the Top Ten, and then with Williams, over commission on subsequent appearances. Williams felt he was still entitled to 10%, but they thought otherwise, and they parted company. In 1960, Williams opened the first beat club in Liverpool city centre, also called the Top Ten. It burned down within a week, but his late-night cabaret venue, the Blue Angel, thrived and in 1963, he promoted a beat festival at the Stanley Stadium, one of the earliest open-air rock concerts in the UK, perhaps the first. He admitted he had wasted his big chance, though. He watched the Beatles on the Royal Variety Performance in November 1963: “That’s when I knew I’d blown it. I threw a cushion at the TV – I wish I’d had a brick.” In 1975 Williams wrote his autobiography, The Man Who Gave the Beatles Away, with the journalist Bill Marshall. When he told Marshall that he could not remember any more anecdotes, Marshall invented some for his approval and Williams was soon telling them as his own. After a series of personal appearances to promote his book, in 1977 Williams, in partnership with the disc-jockey from the Cavern Club in Liverpool, Bob Wooler, organised the first Beatles convention. It promised an appearance by a Beatle. The tension mounted as the audience wondered who it would be. It turned out to be Moore. To make matters worse, Moore could remember little about his time with the Beatles. Williams himself appeared at many conventions around the world, and sold antiques and memorabilia at flea markets. He was always cheerful but he drank too much and Beryl told him to leave. He got together with Wooler’s former wife, Beryl, and he would refer to them as Beryl 1 and Beryl 2. Beryl 2 died in 2003. In 2002 a play based on Williams’s experiences, The Man Who Gave the Beatles Away, written and directed by Ronan Wilmot, was premiered in Dublin. A second volume of his memoirs, The Fool on the Hill, this time written with Lew Baxter, was launched at the Beatles festival in Liverpool in 2003. Over the years, Williams had been vituperative about his relationship with the Beatles, but, in order to promote the book and prompted by Baxter, he became a changed man. He told audiences: “I am a millionaire. I am a millionaire of memories and no one can take that from me.” He is survived by his wife, Beryl, and his son, Justin, and daughter, Leah. • Allan Richard Williams, entrepreneur, born 21 February 1930; died 30 December 2016','https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/01/allan-williams-obituary','Allan Williams obituary',84,'music'),('business/2017/jan/01/tesco-cuts-price-of-womens-razors-so-they-cost-the-same-as-mens','Tesco has reduced the price of women’s standard razors to match that of men’s in the latest victory in the battle to eliminate gender discrimination in high street products. A newspaper investigation at the start of last year showed that women were paying an average of 37% more for gender-targeted items, ranging from toys to beauty products. Razors were found to be among the more marked-up products, with women often paying a premium just because the product was a different colour – pink. Tesco was charging £1 for a pack of five women’s twin-blade razors, twice the price of the men’s equivalent. The Labour backbencher Paula Sherriff, who recently persuaded Boots to trial donation boxes where customers could leave sanitary products for distribution to food banks, put pressure on Tesco to reduce women’s disposable razor prices. In a letter to Sherriff, which has been passed to the Guardian, Tesco’s commercial director for packaged products, Kari Daniels, said the supermarket had reviewed its products to make sure it was not guilty of gender-differentiated pricing following a parliamentary debate. Daniels said the disparity in price was not the result of gender bias, but added: “In the instance of our twin-blade razors, the difference is driven by the fact that male razors are produced and sold in significantly higher volumes, which reduces the price we pay for them. “However, following an internal review and discussions with our suppliers, we have acted on concerns about the difference in price of our female and male disposable twin-blade razors, in line with our commitment to ensure consistently low, simple and affordable pricing. “We have aligned the prices of these products so that the male and female razors are the same price per unit. We have done this by reducing the cost of the women’s razors and keeping the cost of the men’s razors the same.” Both sets of razors now cost 10p per unit. Daniels also insisted that Tesco had changed its pricing strategy so it was “moving away from large, short-term promotions to focus on prices that are consistently low and affordable, and simpler to understand”. Sherriff’s most significant parliamentary triumph since entering the House of Commons last year was forcing the government to confront the EU over the 5% VAT it makes countries impose on sanitary products. Ministers climbed down over the issue after Sherriff secured significant Eurosceptic Conservative support to demand that VAT be scrapped as part of any EU membership renegotiation package before the referendum on 23 June 2016. The former NHS worker, who also convinced WH Smith to reduce the cost of products in hospital shops to be in line with its high street prices, said: “This is a welcome step from Tesco, and I hope other companies will identify and correct similar disparities. “The government has refused to act on gender pricing so we have had to take a lead. I’d encourage anyone who sees examples to get in touch and I’ll take it up.” Although gender-based pricing became a major issue in 2016, there had been concerns about the practice for several years. A 2012 study by Development Economics for insurer Aviva found that women were paying £200 extra a year for what were basically the same consumer goods and services.','https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/01/tesco-cuts-price-of-womens-razors-so-they-cost-the-same-as-mens','Tesco cuts price of women\'s razors so they cost the same as men\'s',85,'business'),('business/2017/jan/01/jean-claude-juncker-blocked-eu-curbs-on-tax-avoidance-cables-show','The president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, spent years in his previous role as Luxembourg’s prime minister secretly blocking EU efforts to tackle tax avoidance by multinational corporations, leaked documents reveal. Years’ worth of confidential German diplomatic cables provide a candid account of Luxembourg’s obstructive manoeuvres inside one of Brussels’ most secretive committees. The code of conduct group on business taxation was set up almost 19 years ago to prevent member states from being played off against one another by increasingly powerful multinational businesses, eager to shift profits across borders and avoid tax. Little has been known until now about the workings of the committee, which has been meeting since 1998, after member states agreed a code of conduct on tax policies and pledged not to engage in “harmful competition” with one another. However, the leaked cables reveal how a small handful of countries have used their seats on the committee to frustrate concerted EU action and protect their own tax regimes. Efforts by a majority of member states to curb aggressive tax planning and to rein in predatory tax policies were regularly delayed, diluted or derailed by the actions of a few of the EU’s smallest members, frequently led by Luxembourg. The leaked papers, shared with the Guardian and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists by the German radio group NDR, are highly embarrassing for Juncker, who served as Luxembourg’s prime minister from 1995 until the end of 2013. During that period he also acted as finance and treasury minister, taking a close interest in tax policy. Despite having a population of just 560,000, Luxembourg was able to resist widely supported EU tax reforms, its dissenting voice often backed only by that of the Netherlands. Among proposals popular in the code of conduct committee but opposed by Luxembourg were: • Plans for tax authorities in each member state to subject their dealings with multinational businesses to peer review. • An investigation into cross-border tax avoidance strategies, known as “hybrid mismatches”, often used by multinationals to conjure up artificial tax savings. • Improved information sharing between member states on tax deals granted to multinationals in private. A spokesperson for Luxembourg’s finance ministry refused to comment on the positions previous governments had taken in private EU discussions. “We have no knowledge of the communications you claim to have, and whether they are genuine, and therefore cannot comment on them,” he said. The spokesperson added: “In recent years Luxembourg has been at the forefront of the global trend towards greater transparency in tax matters and the fight against harmful tax competition.” The Guardian spoke to another former member of the code of conduct committee, who did not want to be named but corroborated claims in the leaked cables that Luxembourg was regularly among those looking to frustrate EU efforts to tackle tax avoidance. The source said the committee was no longer fit for purpose. They said it was unable to achieve much because it was governed by unanimity. “Each country is ready to block any agreement. Moreover, each country stands ready to bargain its position on tax against any other topic at stake in the EU,” they said. Some tax experts contacted by the Guardian confirmed that Luxembourg had begun to move away from certain aggressive tax policies under the current prime minister, Xavier Bettel. However, the leaked cables suggest the country has remained resistant to other changes. In 2016 it fiercely opposed efforts supported by many countries to strengthen and expand the code of conduct committee’s work. Luxembourg particularly objected to a relaxation of the committee’s own rules on decision making, insisting there was no need to abandon the unanimity requirement. France, Germany and Sweden argued unsuccessfully that removing unanimity had become essential to the committee’s effectiveness. Luxembourg also opposed plans to identify member states that were standing in the way of reforms more clearly. One leaked cable noted: “It has become abundantly clear once again that a majority [of members states] are not interested in real reform. In particular, Luxembourg representatives said they would fundamentally object to any proposal to publish arguments made by Luxembourg in the committee.” A later cable read: “It is impressive to see how some member states present themselves outwardly as proponents of [international tax reforms] and at the same time to watch how they actually behave in EU discussions, protected by confidentiality.” The Guardian contacted Juncker’s office for comment. A spokesperson said it was not for the European commission to respond to questions about negotiating positions Luxembourg had taken, or about the country’s past tax policies. Damaging revelations Jean-Claude Juncker’s record as Luxembourg’s prime minister has cast an enduring shadow over his presidency of the European commission. On paper, his marathon 18-year stint at the helm of the EU’s second smallest member state might be hailed a triumph. He recast the fading steel-based economy into a booming hub for international business, and when he departed in 2013 Luxembourg had been transformed into one of the richest countries in the world per capita. Hundreds of the multinational corporations rushed to channel international profits through subsidiaries in the country, among them McDonald’s, Fiat, Amazon, Shire Pharmaceuticals and Skype. The secret to this success was exposed in 2014 when the Luxleaks scandal revealed the terms hidden within hundreds of private deals, known as “tax rulings”, that Luxembourg had handed out to multinational businesses behind closed doors. The rulings effectively rubber-stamped complex tax structures that global corporations used to access ultra-low tax rates, often less than 1%, for profits shifted to Luxembourg. Juncker conceded the scandal had damaged his reputation. While not illegal, he admitted Luxembourg’s tax system was also “not always in line with fiscal fairness” and may have breached “ethical and moral standards”. Since then, Juncker has made a point of supporting the EU’s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, as she pursues high-profile investigations into specific tax rulings, including deals Luxembourg granted separately to McDonald’s and Amazon. The investigations are examining whether the deals were so generous that they amounted to illegal state aid from Juncker’s Luxembourg. Juncker has also campaigned hard for greater tax cooperation among member states in the battle against international businesses that avoid tax. The latest leaked cables, however, raise further questions about whether he is the right person to champion such reforms.','https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/01/jean-claude-juncker-blocked-eu-curbs-on-tax-avoidance-cables-show','Jean-Claude Juncker blocked EU curbs on tax avoidance, cables show',86,'business'),('us-news/2017/jan/01/people-to-watch-2017-kamala-harris-dallas-cowboys-issa-rae','2016 taught us that very little is predictable. But there are a few people worth watching next year, in the likely chance that they’ll have a major role in shaping 2017. Here are the people to keep your eye on, in politics, the arts, media, and sports. Keith Ellison Ellison is one of the new hopes for the Democratic party – or at least for its progressive wing. A former community organizer who serves as a congressman for Minnesota, Ellison has been backed by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren to be the next chair of the Democratic National Committee. Although one of only two Muslims in Congress, Ellison has pledged to resign his seat in Congress if elected as DNC chair. As party chair he would attempt to hew the Democratic party to the left, focusing on grassroots organizing to “build the party from the bottom up”. He would work towards Sanders-esque proposals on taxing the wealthy and corporations, and on immigration reform, in the hope of tempting back Democratic voters in the 2018 mid-term elections. The DNC will meet over the weekend of February 24-26 to vote for their choice. Ellison is not a shoo-in, however; other names mentioned for the chair include Labor secretary Tom Perez, seen as a more moderate choice, and South Carolina Democratic party chairman Jaime Harrison. Steve Bannon The former executive chairman of unofficial Trump fan club Breitbart News will spend 2017 firmly embedded in the White House and is one of the few people who has the ear of the president-elect. Bannon – who is currently being portrayed as the grim reaper on Saturday Night Live – will serve as Trump’s chief strategist and senior counselor, which is a made-up position but one likely to give him significant power. During the presidential campaign Bannon was said to be the one advisor who could talk forcefully to Trump – a rare position and one that means he may be able to hold Trump to some of the right-wing, populist promises that won him the election. Megyn Kelly Trump’s antagoniser-in-chief ended 2016 by releasing a book, Settle for More, for which she was paid up to $10m, and she is likely to have an even more lucrative 2017. Her contract with Fox News expires in July, and she has reportedly been offered $20m a year to stay. Kelly is also apparently being pursued by ABC, NBC and CNN, although they might not offer her quite as much money. Fox News is one of the few broadcasters, newspapers and news websites that Donald Trump does not actively criticize, so the right-wing channel is likely to be his first port of call for interviews. That means that Kelly – despite not being Trump’s favourite Fox News journalist (see: the Republican primary debates) – would have a rare opportunity to hold the president to account. If she decides to stay. Kamala Harris California’s senator-elect hasn’t taken office yet, but she is already being touted as a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2020. Harris, whose mother is Indian American and father is Jamaican, is the first Indian woman and second black woman to be elected to the Senate. She will serve on the homeland security and governmental affairs committee and the select committee on intelligence, which could provide important checks on Donald Trump. Seen as a progressive, Harris was endorsed by the outgoing senator for California, Barbara Boxer, and Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren in her Senate run. She hasn’t commented on the presidential speculation. But Barack Obama was another Democrat who endorsed Harris in 2016 – and running for president as a first term senator seemed to work out for him. Dallas Cowboys The Dallas Cowboys have only lost two games so far and have looked to be one of the better teams in the NFL all season. They’ve been propelled towards that record by two rookies: the quarterback, Dak Prescott, and running back, Ezekiel Elliott. Prescott, 23, was only the 135th pick in the draft, and few would have expected him to get much game time. But after the Cowboys’ veteran quarterback Tony Romo broke a vertebrae in pre-season Prescott became first choice, and promptly broke Tom Brady’s record for most consecutive passes thrown without an interception at the beginning of a career. His performances throughout the season have left some NFL commentators wondering if he might be the best rookie quarterback of all time. Meanwhile Elliot, 21, broke the Cowboys’ 39-year-old rookie record for rushing yards this season and has a chance to become the most successful rookie running back in NFL history. If Prescott and Elliott can keep up their form in the playoffs then the Cowboys could win their first Super Bowl since 1995. Elaine Welteroth This year was huge for Elaine Welteroth, who in May was appointed editor-in-chief of Teen Vogue at just 29. That made her the youngest Condé Nast editor-in-chief in history, and only the second African American to hold such a job. Immediately, Welteroth, along with digital editorial director Phillip Pacardi, upped the magazine’s political and social issues coverage, focusing on the election, LGBT, race and feminist issues. Teen Vogue had more females of color as cover stars than any other fashion magazine this year. And Welteroth has been the face of it all, regularly appearing on panels, in interviews or even as herself on the show Black-ish. Over 77,000 people follow her jet-setting life on Instagram. After publishing around a dozen stories a day in 2015, her team now publishes 50 to 70 daily. But Welteroth will face the challenges of a tough media business in 2017. Last month Condé Nast announced the magazine is getting cut back from a monthly to a quarterly, starting in Spring 2017, with a more collectible print edition and a digital focus. Issa Rae Actress, writer and producer Issa Rae created Insecure, one of 2016’s most praised TV shows. Insecure began airing on HBO in October, putting black women and black female friendships front and center, and mixing microaggressions from working in an all-white work place with conversational Drake lyrics. The show has other big names on board: Larry Wilmore is an executive producer, Solange is a music consultant, Melina Matsoukas (director of Beyonce’s Formation) is a director and executive producer. Rae, 31, first shot to fame as a YouTube star, with her 2011 web series Misadventures of an Awkward Black Girl. Her production company, which also includes ColorCreative.TV, offers opportunities specifically for women and minority writers. In 2017, she’s up for a Golden Globe for best actress in a comedy, will be writing and shooting season two of Insecure, and will serve as executive producer on a new comedy show by her production company called Minimum Wage, the story of five employees at a fast food restaurant in LA’s Koreatown. Lorde It’s been a couple of quiet years for the New Zealander who landed a US number one hit in 2013 when she was just 16 with Royals. Lorde (real name Ella Yelich-O’Connor) won a stack of awards, including two Grammys and became part of Taylor Swift’s squad, but has released no new music since 2014. Now she’s 20 and is just finishing off her sophomore album. “The party is about to start. I am about to show you the new world,” wrote Lorde on Facebook about the new album, explaining that was all about her growing up and learning how to be an adult. Jack Antonoff of Bleachers fame is helping produce it. This month Antonoff and Lorde sung a cover of Robyn’s Hang with Me for a Christmas fundraiser for the LGBT charity The Ally Coalition, in New York, a reminder of Lorde’s strong, ethereal pipes. The new album is expected spring 2017. This article was amended on 3 January 2017.

Now starts, well: the worst worst year. Those of us appalled and terrified by the election of Donald Trump and the open rise of white supremacy in America ended 2016 exhausted and disillusioned. Now we enter 2017 in full knowledge that this year will probably be no better. No matter how much we’d like to hide in our homes for the next four years, we know that we cannot do that. We must fight for equality and justice. But the question is: how? What action can we take in the aftermath of such a heartbreaking defeat? As we start this new year, here are some resolutions for resistance. Check your sources Yes, we are really living in a dystopian future where we can’t be sure of what is true and what isn’t. A sensational story cross your eye? Yes, it may well be accurate. But it could also be made up by a teenager in a basement in Milwaukee, because we apparently live in a horrible world these days. Check the links on all articles to verify that those links actually back up what the original article is saying with source material. No links? Try to find a more reliable source to back up the story. No luck? Then do not share that story. Write down the name of that publication and avoid them in the future. Check the “about us” page of unfamiliar sites: is there actual staff? A lot of fake news sites will try to avoid criticism by calling themselves “satire” (note: the Onion is satire; fake news sites are really trying to trick you). Other red flags: website names that are close but not quite the same as established and reputable news sites, lack of dates on articles, lack of author name on articles, anonymous sources that can’t be verified (ex: “a friend said”, “someone at the scene said”, “our sources say”). Diversify your news The internet gives us a plethora of potential news sources. But we can still find ourselves consuming a dozen versions of the exact same viewpoint and convincing ourselves that we are well-informed. When I was an undergrad political science student, I had an international relations professor who not only required that we read three separate and very different papers each day, but that we read the local, national, international and economic sections of each. Then she would discuss a topic that had appeared in the papers and would test our ability to separate facts from the multiple interpretations given across the papers. This exercise taught me how widely the truth can be shaped and stretched, and how there can indeed be multiple truths for very important issues, depending on viewpoint. It’s a lesson I try not to forget. Try to diversify not only the subject matter you read, but the ideology of the publishers and the identities of the writers. Put your money where your mouth is Make this the year that your money does the talking. Upset about the housing crisis in your area? Donate to a shelter. Believe in abortion rights? Donate to Planned Parenthood. Believe in small business? Shop local. Believe in equal opportunity? Support minority-owned businesses. And don’t put your money into the businesses and banks that profit off the oppression of others or the destruction of the environment. Pay attention to local politics Guess what? There will be an election in 2017, and in 2018, and, well – you get the point. Local elections are where your vote counts the most and local votes are some of the most important votes you can make. What happens in your town can affect what happens in your county, then your state, your region and, ultimately, in the nation. School levies, minimum wages, city council elections – these votes have a real and almost immediate impact on your life and the lives of your community. Don’t give that power away. Stay informed about what is happening locally. And vote. Decentralize whiteness Just about every aspect of western culture centralizes whiteness. Our history, infrastructure, medical system, justice system, education system, entertainment industry – and yes, our social justice organizations – all do this. Whiteness is default, it’s ubiquitous and it’s insidious. We don’t have to purposefully center whiteness. When we neglect to decentralize it, it will be automatically centered. So work to decentralize whiteness: in your children’s school lessons, in your PTA meetings, in your office meetings, in your city council meetings, in the film and TV you watch, in the music you listen to, in the leaders you support. If you do not decentralize whiteness in your movements for progress, you will leave people of color behind. And what kind of progress is that? Understand your privilege Just about all of us have some privilege, and it is very important for us to be aware and to be willing to name that privilege. Your privilege is where you have the most power. Your privilege is the little piece of an oppressive system that you own and can therefore change. For example, I am not disabled – this is a major area of privilege for me. I’m very glad that I know this, because, when I am asked to speak on diversity panels, I can ask if there will also be disabled speakers, ramps and sign language interpreters. My privilege means that I’m asked to speak at more panels than disabled people are. My voice is in the room while disabled voices are not: being aware of that keeps me aware of my power to help change that. If I refused to recognize that privilege (and there was a time where I would have let guilt or just fear of confrontation keep me from doing so) I would simply remain a part of an oppressive system, even while claiming to work for liberation. Remember what you’re fighting for It is very easy to become hyper-focused on what we’re fighting against – neo-Nazis, Islamophobia, racism, sexism. But nothing is a better and more important motivator than what we are fighting for. We are fighting for our communities, for our families, for our future. What keeps you in the battle? Keep that close to your heart and let it be the light that guides your way.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/01/how-to-keep-fighting-for-justice-in-2017','Here are 7 ways you can keep fighting for justice in 2017 | Ijeoma Oluo',88,'commentisfree'),('business/2017/jan/01/uk-economy-will-fare-better-in-2017-than-forecasters-predict','New Year: a time for resolutions, detox diets and predictions. But after the year forecasters had in 2016, who would be brazen enough to predict how 2017 will pan out? Where most economists went wrong last year – including the likes of the Bank of England and International Monetary Fund – was in predicting a sharp slowdown in the event of a vote for Brexit. George Osborne, for example, made the misjudged warning that a vote to leave the EU was a vote for recession. The early data could be revised, but it suggests that far from grinding to a halt, the economy continued to grow in the months following the referendum. Consumers kept spending, house prices rose and businesses continued to win new contracts at home and abroad. There are plenty of signs the economic pain has been delayed rather than averted. Inflation is picking up as a weak pound raises import costs. Cracks are showing in the jobs market and wages will soon struggle to keep pace with inflation. Business and consumer confidence have waned. And Brexit negotiations haven’t even begun. There are other threats beyond Brexit. Elections in the eurozone may bring turmoil to the bloc if support rises for anti-establishment nationalists. In the US, Donald Trump moves into the White House in less than three weeks and there is a risk he may start a trade war with China that could have global consequences. Yet there are still reasons to hope that 2017, like 2016, will not turn out as bad as the doomsayers predict. Surely, one lesson from last year is that when forecasters accentuate the negative they risk missing the positives altogether. So to start the new year on an upbeat note, here are a few reasons to be cheerful in 2017. The economy will keep growing The UK economy remains unbalanced, with an over-reliance on consumer spending, but it chalked up respectable growth in 2016. Expansion will most likely slow in 2017, but the UK should avoid recession. The services sector’s fortunes will depend largely on how hard inflation hits consumer spending. Manufacturing and construction face a tough year as uncertainty and higher costs bite. But tourism and exports should be helped by a weak pound and there has been no exodus of foreign firms from Britain yet. Productivity is back in the spotlight After years of the UK lagging other big economies on productivity, ministers have vowed to sort out economic efficiency and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, announced a £23bn productivity fund in his autumn statement. It will not go very far but it is a start. The government push could be complemented by the private sector if the adversity and higher costs sparked by the Brexit vote force firms to improve their productivity. With a slowdown in immigration and a rise in the minimum wage coming, employers will need to look beyond cheap labour to maintain their profit margins. Ideally, that means investing more in good management, training and technology. Wages for the lowest paid will rise Inflation will squeeze average take-home pay in 2017, but for the lowest paid there is some good news as the “national living wage” – the minimum wage for over-25s – will rise in April from £7.20 to £7.50 an hour. That is still below what anti-poverty campaigners say should be the real living wage needed to meet everyday costs. The voluntary living wage is £9.75 in London and £8.45 elsewhere as set by the Living Wage Foundation. It reckons a fifth of UK workers are still not paid enough. But the good news is 3,000 employers have joined the voluntary scheme, including almost a third of the FTSE 100. Gender pay gap rules come into force There is still a 9.4% gap in average pay between male and female full-time employees. But companies will come under pressure to address the discrepancies when new rules come into force in April requiring large employers to report their gender pay and gender bonus gaps. More funding for apprenticeships Another change for employers this year is the apprenticeship levy, a tax on businesses designed to fund more work-based training schemes. It is high time young people in the UK are given more routes into decent careers and expanding apprenticeships could help tackle skills shortages in sectors such as construction. But employer groups have voiced legitimate concerns that the government risks going after quantity and not quality with its target of 3m apprenticeships by 2020. There are warnings the levy may prompt unscrupulous employers to rebadge existing jobs as apprenticeships to meet training targets and recoup the costs of the charge. Faint hopes for first-time buyers There was no house price crash after the referendum, but growth eased, dampened by Brexit-related uncertainty and stamp duty changes. The market is expected to slow further in 2017 and some forecasters predict prices could fall. That outlook will bring homeowners out in cold sweats but for anyone who has been trying to get on the housing ladder, a moderation in prices is long overdue. There is also a slither of hope that a government drive to address the UK’s housing shortage could help first-time buyers. Still, given past experience of unfulfilled housebuilding promises, they should not hold their breath, and the uncertain economic outlook may make builders nervous about taking on big projects. The weak pound will help exporters There is little sign of it yet, but in theory the weak pound should help UK exports by making them cheaper in overseas markets. If the government wants UK businesses to capitalise on the drop in sterling it will need to give them more support to crack new markets such as one-to-one mentoring and funding to attend trade fairs. Interest rates will stay low The Bank of England faces a trade-off between supporting growth and jobs on the one hand and keeping inflation in check on the other. The Bank has said there are limits to how far it will tolerate rising inflation but most of the signals suggest that under Mark Carney it is more worried about jobs. So it is bad news if you are saver, but for businesses and mortgage holders, 2017 will see continued support from rates staying at, or close to, their all-time low of 0.25%. Calls for government help will grow louder The Bank stepped in with a package of post-referendum support for the economy, but the government has been more hands off. Carney and other central bankers around the world have repeatedly urged politicians to do their share of the heavy lifting to bolster their economies with spending on infrastructure and structural reforms. If Hammond’s maiden autumn statement was anything to go by, he is not ready to pick up the baton. Far from abandoning Osborne’s austerity drive, the new chancellor merely pared it back and he remains fixated on cutting the deficit. Yet, there are growing signs that voters here and abroad are fed up with the status quo and as inflation starts to erode UK living standards, Theresa May’s government will come under more pressure to deliver her promise of an economy “that works for everyone”. She and her cabinet will ignore people’s frustrations at their peril.','https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/01/uk-economy-will-fare-better-in-2017-than-forecasters-predict','Why the UK economy could fare better in 2017 than forecasters predict',89,'business'),('world/2017/jan/01/istanbul-terror-attack-reina-nightclub','The open-air dancefloors, bars and dining terraces of the Reina nightclub in Istanbul have for more than a decade played host to scenes of undiluted glitz. Open since 2002, the venue on the banks of the Bosphorus has earned a reputation as the place to be seen among Turkey’s young, secular elite who recline on its white banquettes and are served ice buckets of drinks by aproned waiters. It attracts footballers from the top Turkish sides and stars from the country’s popular soap operas, as well as tourists and businesspeople from around the world. Daniel Craig, Kylie Minogue, Naomi Watts and Jon Bon Jovi are among the celebrities named as having been guests at the club, according to GC Prive, a London wealth management company that recommends the venue to its clients. The New Year’s Eve terrorist attack on the waterside club was not entirely unexpected. The club’s owner, Istanbul businessman Mehmet Koçarslan, told the Hurriyet newspaper that the US had passed on intelligence over the risk of an attack and security had been stepped up including from the sea. The club is regularly praised in travel guides as the city’s best. In 2011 the Guardian described it as “where Istanbul’s investment bankers dance the night away on the banks of the Bosphorus – the super-flash avoid the traffic of the coastal road and arrive at the club by boat. Its two floors are large enough to include Istanbul’s priciest – and, some say, best – restaurant.” According to the World’s Best Bars website, it is “packed with Turkish celebs, models, millionaires and media players” and “the restaurants run the gamut from Italian to sushi to more traditional local fare”. It is positioned close to the Boğaziçi bridge, which last summer was renamed 15 July Martyrs Bridge after the civilians who died in last year’s failed coup, including some who perished on the bridge. Tourists report that it is not always easy to gain entrance to the club, even if you are ready to pay the regular £18 entrance fee at weekends, as door staff can be selective.','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/01/istanbul-terror-attack-reina-nightclub','Reina: site of Istanbul attack, a nightclub renowned for famous guests',90,'world'),('artanddesign/2017/jan/01/art-market-faces-uncertain-2017-falling-profits','It’s been a strange, unsettling year in the art market and 2017 looks likely to be just as turbulent. What does a new president who can rattle the world with a tweet mean for an industry so dependent on the international rich? The answer is that no one knows, but it is a hot topic among gallery owners and auctioneers this new year. In 2016, the art market received what it had purportedly wished for – some of the speculative froth came off the top of the market, easing fears that a bubble would burst and hurt the industry. But it also received much of what it probably did not forecast or desire: a 30% drop in overall market volume, a series of high-profile disputes, court actions and authenticity issues that resulted in substantial payouts, and a fall-off in attendance at some art fairs that read to some as cultural cooling-off at the bling end of the contemporary art business. The two major auction houses, privately held Christie’s and publicly listed Sotheby’s, have also undergone substantial changes to their business models whose reverberations are still being assessed. A dwindling supply of top-quality work, costly seller-guarantee systems and the overheads required to secure lots for sale have proved unsustainable. Both houses saw drops in business, with Sotheby’s down from $6bn in 2015 to roughly $4.1bn in 2016. “The art market went down primarily because a small number of high-value objects did not trade hands as they had in 2015 and that reduced the overall market volume,” says Art Market Monitor’s Marion Maneker. Still, both Sotheby’s and Christie’s auction houses instigated shakeups of their tradition-bound methods of business. Christie’s contemporary art chief, Brett Gorvy, quit after 23 years at the auction house to join Dominique Lévy’s gallery, which represents Frank Stella and the estate of Yves Klein among others. Sotheby’s too lost several longstanding department executives and announced plans to start offering management services to living artists as well as artist’s estates. That development has galleries rattled. Managing artists has traditionally been a gallery’s job – not something done by “secondary market” auction houses. “For an auction house to represent a living artist is like MGM representing Fred Astaire – you can’t tie up all the sides of a transaction,” Pace Gallery’s Arne Glimcher told the Wall Street Journal. At the same time, many of the younger artists whose work had been driven up in value over the past several years, saw their work unceremoniously dumped at auction, reflecting the speculative spirit in which it had been purchased. Collector Niels Kantor told Bloomberg News he paid $100,000 for an abstract canvas by Hugh Scott-Douglas. Two years later, in September, he sold it at Phillips for $30,000. “I’d rather take a loss,” Kantor told the market data service. “It’s like a stock that crashed.” Phillips estimated that half of the 204 lots in the same sale were below $10,000 – an indicator that speculators were dumping work. Instead of new artists, art advisers indicate many collectors are now most interested in rediscovering historically important artists that have slipped past undervalued. Two high-profile forgeries made headlines in 2016, forcing the business to take steps to reassure customers. Jurors in the Knoedler Gallery fraud trial in New York, heard how more than a dozen abstract expressionist masters were forgeries, while forensic conservator James Martin concluded that an $8.4m Frans Hals painting sold to a US collector by Sotheby’s was fake. The auction house quickly moved to hire Martin to provide museum-quality expertise. But the big unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable, question, is how the new political environment could affect the market. The softness in the art market in 2016 could be seen in the low attendance at Art Basel in Miami Beach this year and mirrored in sales across most luxury market sectors, including real estate. Yet the November auction sales proved unexpectedly robust following Donald Trump’s election. Sotheby’s CEO, Tad Smith, told CNBC that the result had helped boost optimism in the art market. “I think there’s been a fairly good feeling among the art collectors this week,” Smith said in November. “There’s just a lot of very wealthy people from all types of countries … and they have a lot of capital to deploy.” Market observers have not been slow to note the similarities between Trump’s approach to business and that of Andy Warhol, who set up his studio production and promotional publishing machine in ways that correspond to Trump’s real estate and self-promotion machinery. Artnet noted explicit similarities between Trump’s business philosophy outlined in The Art of the Deal and Warhol’s The Philosophy of Andy Warhol: “Making money is art, and working is art and good business is the best art,” Warhol said succinctly. Trump meanwhile offered this: “I don’t do it for the money. I’ve got enough, much more than I’ll even need. Deals are my art form. Other people paint beautifully on canvas or write wonderful poetry. I like making deals, preferably big deals. That’s how I get my kicks.” Many members of the incoming administration’s cabinet, including the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, are art collectors. The art market boomed during the Reagan administration and through most of George W Bush’s tenure. Still, Maneker says it’s too soon to speculate on the art market under Trump. “You can draw two diametrically opposed scenarios based on the same behavior. If Trump raises tariffs and causes global panic, art could then become exceedingly valuable because it’s portable, easy to store and not a currency. But it could also become worthless. Nobody knows the right answer.” But as the year in art turns, at least there has been some good news for rock’s elite in what has been in all other terms a dark year. In the weeks after September 11 2001, guitarist Eric Clapton acquired, in a single lot at Sotheby’s, three Gerhard Richter abstracts for $3.4m. He sold the last of the three, Abstraktes Bild (809-2), at Christie’s in November for $22.1m, bringing his total profit on all three works to $74.1m. There was another winner, too, from the rock world. Christie’s outgoing head Gorvy revealed last week, he had sold a Jean-Michel Basquiat boxer painting from Christie’s private selling exhibition via his Instagram feed. The buyer was an unnamed American collector who paid $24m sight unseen. The seller? Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich.','https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jan/01/art-market-faces-uncertain-2017-falling-profits','Art market faces uncertain 2017 after falling values and high-profile disputes',91,'artanddesign'),('travel/2017/jan/01/mexican-heritage-in-a-glass-tasting-pulque-in-mexico-city','Forget tequila and mezcal, Mexico’s oldest alcoholic drink is pulque, made from the fermented sap of an agave plant. The Aztecs dubbed it “drink of the gods” and reserved it for priests and nobles. Ancient murals depict the milky liquid fuelling grisly ritual sacrifice. After the Spanish arrived in the 1500s, pulque became widely available and the first pulquerías opened. It was the working man’s tipple and in the early 20th century there were more than 1,000 pulquerías in Mexico City. In its natural state, pulque can be slimy and sour-tasting, but it is rich in probiotics, vitamins and minerals. Devotees believe it can cure everything from digestive disorders to diabetes. By the 1950s, its popularity had plummeted, thanks in part to campaigns from beer and soft drinks companies. Now it’s in vogue once more, with old-school establishments being reinvented and neo-pulquerías popping up in the capital. One such venue is Pulquería Insurgentes in the city’s Roma district, a four-storey bar-cum-cultural centre that pulses to an eclectic mix of music, from ranchera to heavy metal and jazz. Another bar in the Centro Histórico – Las Duelistas , founded in 1912 – has been transformed. Pulque is still scooped out of wooden barrels, but psychedelic murals adorn the walls, and hipsters outnumber old-timers. The drink is made in the age-old way: sap from the heart of the plant fermented for a week or two, then mixed and muddled with all manner of fruits, vegetables and grains – perhaps guava, celery or oatmeal – in a curado. It’s Mexican heritage in a glass, and last night pulquerías were celebrating New Year’s Eve once more.

Yet Texas is poised to propose a similar law in 2017. In November, one of the state’s most senior politicians published his top 10 priorities for the next legislative session. A “Women’s Privacy Act” was at number six, right after banning immigration “sanctuary cities” and insisting on photo ID at the ballot box. The act, said lieutenant governor Dan Patrick, is necessary so that “women and girls” can have “privacy and safety in their restrooms, showers and locker rooms”. When filed, the bill is likely to turn national attention to Texas in the wake of North Carolina legislators’ failure to repeal their bill during a special session on 21 December. Patrick issued a statement the following day congratulating them. The so-called bathroom bill in North Carolina includes a provision that requires people to use public bathrooms that match the gender on their birth certificate. Critics have described it as a thinly veiled attack on the transgender community under the guise of protecting public safety. Patrick hasn’t released his own proposed bill, but has said it would allow businesses to create their own bathroom policies. Despite the demonstrable negative consequences in states that have passed laws that undermine LGBTQ equality, the coming months will indicate whether the ascent of Donald Trump to the White House is emboldening religious conservatives to press for more such bills after a series of gains for gay and transgender people at the federal level under the Obama administration. A federal court ruling Saturday may further embolden these efforts. A Texas judge temporarily halted Obama administration rules that are intended to ban discrimination by doctors and hospitals against transgender persons. Joining Texas in the suit were Wisconsin, Kentucky, Nebraska and Kansas. In August, the same judge sided with 13 Republican-controlled states to block transgender protections in public schools sought by the Obama administration. ‘Something that should be avoided’ So-called “religious freedom” provisions similar to those that caused controversy in Indiana in 2015 are also set to be aired in the Texas statehouse next year. “I certainly believe that logically thinking people would look to North Carolina and look to Indiana,” said Chuck Smith, chief executive of Equality Texas, an LGBTQ advocacy group. Such people would see, he said, “the economic consequences that were experienced in those states as a result of filing discriminatory legislation, and a logically thinking person would come to the conclusion that that is something that should be avoided in the state of Texas.” The state’s chamber of commerce, the Texas Association of Business (TAB), reached that view. It has produced a 23-page report warning of dire economic consequences if the state follows North Carolina’s path by pursuing a policy that would harm tourism, alienate employers and dissuade talented millennials from staying in or moving to Texas. “If you just look at North Carolina and Indiana and put that over a Texas-sized footprint of our economy, it could be up to $8.5bn and 185,000 jobs lost, it is very dramatic,” said Chris Wallace, the association’s president. “We want to remain one of the top states in which to do business, so why would we want to do anything to risk any of that, by legislation that’s really unnecessary and unenforceable? “The question of how you would enforce people going into the right bathroom…What, so you have to take your birth certificate? It gets really tricky. “We’ve got too many core issues that we need to be worried about in this state – education, transportation, water, many more. Economic development, keeping us strong. We don’t need these types of issues to overshadow our core agenda items.” Att a Texas Tribune event in November, Joe Straus, the speaker of the Texas house of representatives, said he had other, more urgent concerns than the bathroom bill. Patrick, though, appears unmoved. In a statement earlier this month his office called the TAB report “misinformation and fear-mongering regarding a bill they haven’t even seen”. It also defended the proposal as a way to “assure that sexual predators, like those who exploit the internet, will not be able to freely enter women’s restrooms, locker rooms or showers, and that businesses are not forced by local ordinances to allow men in women’s restrooms and locker rooms”. Patrick’s spokesperson did not return a Guardian request for comment. ‘We have a friend in the White House’ Sexual assault in any location is, of course, already illegal, while there is no evidence that non-discrimination laws have resulted in increased rates of sexual assault. By contrast, LGBTQ advocates argue that violence and bias against transgender people is a very real problem exacerbated by prejudicial laws. North Carolina’s HB2 was signed into law by Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican who lost his bid for re-election in November. The backlash saw sports events and concerts cancelled and businesses scrapping investment plans. Patrick, 66, was a radio talkshow host perhaps best-known for getting an on-air vasectomy until he was elected as lieutenant governor in 2014 on a platform of stopping the “invasion” of undocumented immigrants. He was the Texas state chairman for the Trump presidential campaign. “Starting in 2017, we will have a friend in the White House who was clearly elected because the people of this country believe in the conservative principles that have guided the way we govern in Texas,” Patrick said in November. Smith, of Equality Texas, said that Texas’s conservative politicians telegraphed their intentions to introduce more anti-equality legislation long before Trump’s victory. “I believe we have seen a heightened sense of concern about the possibility of favourable policies being rolled back on a federal level,” he said. “At the state level we already saw the threats that were lying ahead and those haven’t really changed.” The US supreme court legalised same-sex marriage nationwide in June 2015. That major victory for gay rights appears to have inspired a pushback by conservative Republicans in states. According to the Human Rights Campaign, more than 200 “anti-LGBTQ bills” were introduced across the country in 2016 sessions – most failing to pass – and more than 111 million people live in states without clear state-level protections against LGBTQ workplace discrimination. Smith is also concerned that 2017 will see Texas legislators press for “religious freedom” laws that would, for example, exempt Christian retailers who believe homosexuality is a sin from providing services for gay weddings. So far there are a handful of Texas bills which advocates consider anti-LGBTQ that have been filed amid the usual slew of pro-gun, pro-God, anti-undocumented immigrant, anti-abortion and anti-federal government proposals up for discussion when the legislative session starts in January. One would eliminate local non-discrimination ordinances if they have protections that go beyond state law – reminiscent of HB2. Another calls on the state not to enforce federal laws that the Texas legislature deems to violate the state constitution – which since 2005 has defined marriage as between a man and a woman.

Despite the title,​ the factor that tie​s​ most of them together ​is the presence in their lives of “difficult” and/or abusive men: a man abducts and rapes two young sisters; a hydrologist harasses a female structural engineer; an aged, alcoholic father is taken in by the two daughters he abused, and so on. Gay’s women are perpetually under threat. However, Gay never portrays them as weak. Each possesses a strength that enables them to escape, move on or distance themselves from difficult situations. The title of the collection carries the same sarcasm as when Gay describes her female subjects with well-worn stereotypes: “crazy”, “loose”, “frigid”, etc. The stories, phenomenally powerful and beautifully written, demonstrate the threats so many women in reality face, but also how, whatever their situation, they have agency, resilience and identities away from stereotypes created and reinforced by men. •&nbsp;Difficult Women by Roxane Gay is published by Corsair (£13.99).

She’s on her way to Greenwich, Connecticut, to hustle some money out of an estranged sister who married rich. Then the sister is arrested for fraud, and Mackenzie is stuck taking care of her kids. If this seems like something of a tired comedic premise, that’s part of the appeal of The Mick: with so many other comedies this year eschewing straightforward laughs in favor of complicated stories about depression, it’s nice to have a show that wants to throw out some of the most disgusting jokes it can think of, all while gleefully endangering children. Not that star Kaitlin Olson is in any way a stranger to gross-out humor – as one of the stars of FXX’s long-running series It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, she has long had an outlet for her equal parts debauched and high-strung energy. In theory, Mackenzie should be judged absent comparisons to Olson’s Sunny character Dee, but The Mick’s pedigree (from past Sunny writers) and the comedy it asks of Olson makes parallels inevitable. If The Mick proves anything, it’s that Olson is an extraordinarily talented comedian. Mickey’s snotty nephews and niece aren’t Rob McElhenny, Glenn Howerton and Charlie Day but they do bring different, snivelling energy to the proceedings. Chip (Thomas Barbusca) is an angry, entitled kid who thinks he can sue his way into anything, while Sabrina (Sofia Black D’Elia) is a classic rich kid, more concerned with seeing her friends DJ in Soho than remembering siblings’ birthdays. The best thing about The Mick is that Mackenzie, barely inhibited by feelings of affection for her charges and coming from a background of laziness and debauchery herself, is willing to do all sorts of things no parent would ever do on TV, particularly with Sabrina. Mickey forces her into a drinking contest, tricks her into thinking she’s pregnant as a way of teaching her about sex, and turns a birthday party for the youngest child, Ben (Jack Stanton) into a competitive parenting arena. Though It’s Always Sunny is the obvious point of comparison, Sabrina and Mickey’s barb-trading helps center The Mick’s thematic target: the ultra-wealthy. If you centrifuge out the Sunny elements, it seems awfully similar in its core concept to another Fox sitcom about a family of awful rich people dealing with fraud charges … A few episodes in, The Mick is more than a bit too soft to cut so deeply. Like nearly all sitcoms, The Mick looks like it’s going to be about the formation of a makeshift family – including Carla Jimenez as Alba, the Pembertons’ housekeeper and Mackenzie’s friend, and Scott MacArthur as Jimmy, her not-quite-boyfriend – rather than Arrested Development’s focus on a family that really ought not to stay together. But The Mick’s warm emotional core might be a justified response to its central premise: having all of the hijinks supported by obscenely rich criminals who also just happen to be absent. Isn’t that the dream?','https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/01/the-mick-review-kaitlin-olson-fox-comedy','The Mick review – Kaitlin Olson shines amid goofiness and gross-outs',95,'tv-and-radio'),('technology/2017/jan/01/tech-startups-to-make-your-life-more-slick-secure-and-stylish-in-2017','This year was a mixed bag for startups. Powa Technologies, an e-commerce company that was one of Britain’s so-called unicorns (a startup valued at over $1bn), crashed hard, declaring bankruptcy early in 2016. US wearables company Pebble sold to Fitbit for less than a 10th of its peak valuation. But on the plus side, Europe minted – foaled? – 10 new unicorns, and Finnish gaming company Supercell became the continent’s first “decacorn” (a startup valued at over $10bn). But for some startups, the year ahead is nothing but hopeful. Here are some of the companies that look set to have a 2017 they will remember for some time. Monzo Banking startup Monzo launched in 2015, but 2017 is set to be a turning point for the fintech darling. For the first 18 months of its public operation, Monzo has been limited in what it can offer customers by British banking regulations, forcing it to operate as little more than a pre-paid debit card with a (very slick) app. But early next year, Monzo should receive a full banking licence, allowing it to operate as the main bank account for users who want to switch their financial life over to a startup wholesale. Crucially, the license gives it access to the direct debit and faster payments system, allowing users to pay bills from their Monzo accounts – and be paid into their accounts. The banking licence also means the company can start making money for the first time. Users will be able to request an overdraft facility on their Monzo current accounts, with the fees paid being the first revenue the startup will pull in. In the long term, though, don’t expect it to settle for overdraft fees: Monzo wants to be Facebook for money. Thread Fashion tech startup Thread is trying to solve the problem of styling at scale. It’s a tricky beast: your style is an inherently personal thing, yet for any startup to avoid burning money, it needs to come up with a way to efficiently pick clothes for thousands of customers at the same time. Thread’s trick is a clever mixture of human stylists, AI assistants and tools that let both work together to deliver a semi-personalised collection of outfit ideas to every customer. It means that each human stylist is able to provide five outfits a week to somewhere in the realm of 80,000 people, with Thread’s sartorial suggestions improving the more data it has on each member. Despite its data-driven back end, though, the stylists’ fashion sense still shines through. Still to come: womenswear, which has been on the backburner owing to the vast increase in complexity for women’s fashion. Automata Robotics startup Automata has its background in architecture: the company’s founders spent 10 years working in Zaha Hadid’s studios. There, they learned the value of robots for simple repetitive tasks, but also the prohibitive cost of most of the machines available on the market today. The fruits of their labour will arrive in 2017: a low cost robotic arm, which the company hopes will give robotics its “iPhone moment”. It can be programmed by simply moving the arm, showing it the movements it needs to carry out. Those motion points are stored, and used to automate the task. The company has is set on automating low-skilled, repetitive manual labour. Rather than going for scale, however, it’s focusing on smaller companies that would love to automate their business but can’t afford the capital costs. Open Whisper Systems Open Whisper Systems is never going to become a unicorn, or make its founders rich, but it could be the startup that has the most effect on the coming year. The non-profit group is in charge of the development of iPhone app Signal, an encrypted messaging service that has Edward Snowden’s seal of approval. Where Signal differs from most secure chat apps is its ease-of-use: the app feels very similar to everyday services like WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger. In fact, WhatsApp also offers encryption, and borrowed the basic code wholesale from Signal. That’s fine, because Open Whisper Systems makes everything it does available under open-source licences, which allow others to reuse the code as they see fit. It also lets anyone with the technical knowhow examine the app to make sure it does what it says it does. Downloads of Signal spiked in the days after Donald Trump’s election, as many realised that a far-right demagogue would soon be in charge of the world’s most advanced surveillance apparatus. Hopefully, that will prove to be an abundance of caution, but if not, the app could be a lifesaver. OnePlus Hardware is hard. It’s not enough simply to code something and release it to the world. You need to actually build the stuff, too. So it’s extra impressive that Chinese startup OnePlus has managed to rise to be one of the best smartphone manufacturers in the world in just three years and five phones. And it 2017, it hopes to take third place in the global smartphone market, by units shipped, placing it square behind Samsung and Apple. It’s a big goal, but the smartphone maker could pull it off. It chases the premium end of the budget market – or the budget end of the premium market – by making phones that compete favourably with the flagships such as Samsung and Google, but with price tags hundreds of pounds lower. CCP Icelandic games company CCP hardly counts as a startup. Founded in 1997, the company is best known for its first and flagship game, Eve Online, a space-faring massively multiplayer game, which has been running continuously for 13 years. Eve remains a huge business, and recently went free to play in an effort to entice more users to jump into the galaxy of New Eden, but CCP’s big bet is in a different realm. Two Eve spinoffs, Valkyrie and Gunjack, have led the pack of virtual reality-based games. Gunjack, a turret shooter, is one of the more popular games on simple VR platforms like Google’s Daydream. Eve Valkyrie, meanwhile, is a full-blown multiplayer space combat sim, throwing the player into chaotic dogfights around the rusting hulks of dead spaceships. Both games have been well-received, leading to interest from potential buyers mooting a €900m price-tag.','https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/01/tech-startups-to-make-your-life-more-slick-secure-and-stylish-in-2017','Tech startups to make your life more slick, secure and stylish in 2017',96,'technology'),('world/2017/jan/01/us-navy-piracy-somali-west-virginia-prison','Mohamed Hassan Farah, a Somali in US federal prison, has little in common with the 19th-century seafarer Thomas Smith besides the fact that they are among the few people to be convicted of piracy on the high seas in a US court. While Smith and 13 of his crewmates were hanged in 1820 for boarding and pillaging 30 vessels in three months – including one by the name of Irresistible – Farah is expected to be handed a life sentence in a matter of weeks. He will serve his time in a US prison after being first detained thousands of miles away and convicted using laws that are centuries old. Farah is one of only 28 Somalis to be convicted of piracy in the US in recent years following a multinational crackdown after a spike in attacks and kidnappings. Besides costing the global commerce $18bn a year, Somali pirates have taken several lives – including four Americans traveling on a private yacht – and terrorized the people they kept hostage, as famously depicted in the film Captain Phillips. Speaking by phone from prison in Glenville, West Virginia, he tells the Guardian about the night in 2010 he and his five crew got into a gun battle with the US navy in the Gulf of Aden, an encounter in which he lost a leg and which ultimately culminated in his incarceration. He protests his innocence and, while the prosecution described him and his co-defendants as serious threats, Farah is still confused as to how he ended up in a cell in West Virginia. He claims his craft was returning from smuggling people from Somalia to Yemen when their ship broke down and left them stranded at sea for seven days without food or water. He said he had fallen asleep by the engine of the skiff when he was jolted by the sound of an AK-47. The gunshots were let off by a crewmate who had spotted a vessel in the distance and had hoped to attract help, Farah said. At the later trial a key question was whether the initial shot was in the air or at the ship. “After he shot, we all woke up, and started screaming at each other,” said Farah, who uses a wheelchair and communicates with people in the prison with sign language as he does not speak English. The crew quickly realized this was no ordinary vessel: it was the USS Ashland, an American navy ship. According to court testimony from the USS Ashland crew viewed by the Guardian and Farah’s account, the navy responded by firing on the skiff with an MK-38, a machine gun that can tear through helicopters and armored vehicles. A bullet hit Farah’s crewmate fatally in the chest and he watched the man fly overboard. Before he could jump in the water, another shot struck their tiny boat. It hit the engine, causing an explosion that set the whole boat ablaze. Farah said he went in and out of consciousness. His crewmates – now covered in burns – trod water and held him up. Unbeknown to him at the time, one of his legs had been blown off in the explosion. Eventually a navy reconnaissance team came out to round the men up. “I was unconscious when we got on the [US navy] boat,” he said, speaking to the Guardian via a translator. “Afterwards, they said we were pirates who kidnap boats, that we were carrying weapons.” After the gun incident, the navy brought the men to US shores to stand trial in Norfolk, Virginia. They were indicted for piracy on the high seas, a charge that carries life in federal prison; Farah and his crewmates denied the charges. Farah’s arrest was the result of a new policy enacted a few years prior. Western countries had formed a naval coalition involving ships from at least 12 countries to patrol the Gulf of Aden as piracy spiraled out of control in 2008 and some countries decided to try captured seafarers suspected of piracy. This created a lottery of outcomes for Somalis in which America – with its tough justice system – was the least favorable destination. Regardless of his guilt or innocence, Farah might already be out of prison had he been caught by a Dutch or French ship. “In some states they could not convict them because they didn’t have the offense of piracy or only piracy committed on the high seas,” said Anna Petrig, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Basel who has written on the detention of pirates. “They could only be convicted of ordinary crimes and receive sentences of only five or six years.” Somali piracy had been a problem since the turn of the century but it intensified in 2008, when the number of hostages taken from merchant and private ships jumped from 177 to 815 in just one year. Hijackings and attempted hijackings in the Gulf of Aden, a popular shipping route, increased five-fold that year, according to statistics from the International Maritime Bureau. The shipping industry began putting pressure on western governments to tackle the problem as it was jeopardizing a valuable trade route. A series of United Nations resolutions passed between 2008 and 2009, allowed foreign navies to patrol Somalia’s territorial waters for pirates. But these navy patrols arguably did not fully anticipate one thing: what to do with the pirates when they were caught? The confusion around this question led to nine out of 10 pirates being released after capture in the first few years of the patrols. Some countries agreed to take pirates who attacked their own interests for trial – the US was one of them. Farah and his co-defendants were among the first pirates the US brought back for trial. Today, the Somali pirates incarcerated in American prisons number at least 28, stemming from just five cases. Life sentence Farah told the Guardian he was born in a small village outside of the coastal city of Bosaso in Somalia, where his parents kept cattle or fished to get by. He and his 15 siblings – nine sisters and six brothers – did not get much in the way of an education growing up. Farah said he had taken only three years of Qur’anic school as a child. During his trial some 7,556 miles away from his village, he was up against the US district attorney of Eastern Virginia. The case, though, against the men proved to be extremely convoluted as the only law pertaining to piracy in the US was 200 years old. Bringing that law into the present day presented a range of hurdles. “My very first thought,” said attorney Christian Connell, who represented one of the men: “How can they prosecute these guys right here? That’s just crazy to me.” UN resolutions passed in the 1980s gave all nations jurisdiction over piracy on the high seas, and therefore the right to prosecute a pirate for crimes committed in international waters. Shortly after their arrival in the US, the six men were appointed lawyers and translators since none of them spoke English. The DA convinced Farah’s co-defendant Jama Idle Ibrahim, represented by Connell, to cooperate with the government. Ibrahim had been identified as a participant in a previous piracy case and the state provided him with an ultimatum: either cooperate or face life sentences in both cases, his lawyer said. At the trial before a jury in February 2013, Ibrahim testified that the entire crew had embarked on this trip to loot ships. He had made $17,000 the year before after capturing a Danish ship but had run out of money and decided to set out again. According to transcripts of his court testimony, obtained by the Guardian, Ibrahim said that he assembled a crew of seven, in which he was the leader and Farah was the driver and responsible for the boat’s engine. The navy killed one and the remaining six were on trial in Norfolk. With little time after the five-day trial, the jury found the men guilty on all counts, including piracy. Ibrahim’s testimony proved damning. Farah was sentenced to 32 years in prison. The judge ruled that a life sentence was too severe despite them being found guilty of piracy. The government appealed to have the life sentence reinstated – and won. The supreme court subsequently declined to hear the case. Farah was brought back to Virginia to await his new sentence, but it remains unclear where he will serve his lifelong imprisonment. He has spent the past few years at the Gilmer federal correctional institution, a medium security prison with about 1,500 inmates in Glenville, West Virginia. Along with his amputated leg, Farah has suffered from other health issues in prison. “I have problems with my stomach,” he said from a prison phone. “My intestines are not fine, and the doctors have said that I should do a surgery, but the government hasn’t done anything to make that a reality.” He said he often has trouble eating because of his stomach issues and is put on an intravenous drip for sustenance. However, Farah said that he does not mind life in jail. He has found solace in the prison’s Muslim community. His cellmate is a Muslim from Washington DC. Even though they can’t speak to one another, they get along. The imams at the prison mosque have assisted Farah with money for soap and phone credits. He managed to make an international call to his family once, but was restricted to the 15-minute time limit placed on prison calls. “They told me they were all fine,” he said. “But what can someone whom you speak to for 15 minutes tell you?” Farah’s main concern in the interview was confusion surrounding his case. He said he was unsure of the status of his case during the earlier appeals. He has since acquired new counsel but having spent six years in prison, he has little hope for the future. “We have no one to support us or deliver us from these problems, except for Allah.”','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/01/us-navy-piracy-somali-west-virginia-prison','How the US war on piracy brought one Somali to a West Virginia prison',97,'world'),('travel/2017/jan/01/refuge-in-italian-dolomites-bleggio-second-world-war','We had come to Bleggio by car, traversing mountain roads to reach this remote area of the Dolomites directly north of Lake Garda. Driving from southern Trentino we headed down towards Riva, a tourist town on the northern shores of the lake, and then due north, gaining altitude as we zipped up a valley pass. Sheer peaks and dense forest penned us in the higher we went, until we reached a plateau of rolling hills and a herb-flecked meadow. It was to this protected alpine world that my grandmother, great aunt and two great uncles had fled as children in the final years of the second world war, living alone on a small farm while their parents were forced to remain in their occupied hometown of Ala. This was a journey made by many children at the time; when Italy declared itself an allied nation the country fell into civil war and fascist troops took hold of the north of the country. Bleggio was a safe haven far removed from the fighting. We had come – me, my mother, her partner and my girlfriend – to explore this place that had protected our extended family. The exact location of their hideout was a mystery due to the fact that my relations, Maria, Liliana, Desiderio and Franco, had existed here as sfollati, an Italian term for displaced people, meaning they had no official records attached to them. There were blurry childhood memories of a mountainside farmhouse and keeping chickens, but nothing concrete. In lieu of a precise location, we had plotted a walk across the valley from east to west ending on Cima Sera, a peak overlooking the entire region. Our base was Maso Pra Cavai, a guesthouse and family-run farm. We arrived late in the day but received a warm welcome from the owner, Rodolfo Brochetti, who served us delicious plates of a risotto made with cooking apples (half simmered with the rice, half added just before serving). The Brochetti farm, like many in the area, specialises in walnuts and Rodolfo ended the evening with walnut liqueur, pickled walnuts and a large walnut cake. We began walking early the next day from Stenico, a village perched on one of the highest points in the region, where the ruling prince-bishops had kept a castle from which to cast an eye out over their lands. Sticking my head out of an arched stone window I took in the rolling expanse below and found myself wondering where my family might have lived and what their life would have been like. As far as we were aware, the four siblings – the youngest was six and the eldest 14 – were driven up the same pass we had taken into the valley and dropped off somewhere remote with a supply of grains, preserves and livestock. A local priest would have been paid some money to keep an eye on them but they were largely left to their own devices. They would have felt incredibly free and safe here but there would have been the anxiety of living away from their parents and all that was familiar to them, until the family were eventually reunited following the end of the war and Italian liberation. Further down the valley in Madice, strange rickety buildings were packed into rows on its sloping streets. Each home had a cave-like entrance and a large wooden hayloft on top, accessible only by a curving stone ramp. We stopped at the regional municipal office on the off-chance that they would have some information, but the administrators confirmed that they had no records of families staying during the war. Instead, they suggested that the best resource was local people, custodians of a wealth of oral history in this region that is far richer than any state archive. As we made our way through Bleggio, village after village, it was hard to avoid hunting for signs of my relatives, continually feeling as though I was about to discover some clue or proof of their existence here. A mile or so from the mountain I obsessed over a tiny chapel at the side of the road, its walls covered with graffitied names dating back to the war. I hoped naively to find the names of my family scrawled into the side – suppose they had lived nearby? – but there was no sign. After clambering up slanting beech forest and rocky scrub, we reached the peak of Cima Sera and sat down to watch the land unfolding beneath us. Far away was castle Stenico, now barely visible. From up here it was easier to accept that this trip was never going to throw up a miraculous find: there was no perfect alpine cottage waiting with a lit fire and a smiling portrait of my family. Yet just being in this region, knowing that our family were once kept secure somewhere in this hilly expanse, left us with a feeling of having discovered something significant about them, and getting a glimpse into their childhood. Leaving the mountain, we decided to return next year, to interview some of the older community. Beyond the draw of personal history, this region holds so many stories from an overlooked period of Italian history and it is important to listen to them before they disappear for ever.

The Treasury said the government’s new powers would see individuals or corporations who take deliberate action to help others evade paying tax facing fines of up to 100% of the tax they helped evade or £3,000, whichever is highest. The new crackdown, first announced by the then chancellor George Osborne in the 2015 budget, will mean HMRC can, for the first time, penalise the facilitators of tax evasion who help to physically move funds abroad or advise on offshore tax saving. Announcing the new penalties, the financial secretary to the Treasury Jane Ellison said: “Tax evasion is a crime and as a government we have led reform of the international tax system to root it out. Closer to home we are creating a tax system where taxes are fair, competitive and paid. The raft of measures we have introduced to tackle avoidance and evasion will create a level playing field for the vast majority of people and businesses who play fair and pay what is due.” A new corporate criminal offence of failing to prevent the facilitation of tax evasion will also be introduced this year, with companies held liable if an individual acting on their behalf as an employee or contractor facilitates tax evasion. Previous rules meant a corporate criminal prosecution was only possible if there was proof that the board of directors were aware and involved in facilitating the evasion. The Treasury said HMRC had secured more than £2.5bn specifically from offshore tax evaders since 2010. However, the department was criticised last November after its new specialist tax evasion unit only successfully pursued one criminal prosecution, despite having identified potential evasion and avoidance worth nearly £2bn after examining the tax affairs of 6,500 super-rich individuals. Also coming into force on 1 January is a new requirement to correct past tax evasion, which will see anyone who has failed to correct past evaded taxes by 30 September 2018 hit with tough new penalties. The Treasury said more action was planned in the coming months, including a consultation on a new requirement for businesses and individuals who create complex offshore financial arrangements that bear the hallmarks of enabling tax evasion to notify them to HMRC. May pledged during her leadership campaign that she would pursue companies and individuals who took part in deliberate tax avoidance. “It doesn’t matter to me whether you’re Amazon, Google or Starbucks: you have a duty to put something back, you have a debt to fellow citizens and you have a responsibility to pay your taxes,” she said.','https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/01/hmrc-tax-evasion-enablers-fines','HMRC empowered to name and shame tax evasion \'enablers\'',100,'business'),('football/2017/jan/01/transfer-window-premier-league-january-fans-shopping-list-selections','Arsenal Based on his form against us, I certainly wouldn’t kick Cavani out of bed, but the scarcity of genuine world-class goal poachers is evident in Man Utd’s willingness to speculate almost twice the price of Sánchez on the unproven talents of Martial. Plenty of Gooners might be pleased to see no further spending, since presumably Arsenal will only loosen the purse strings if Wenger has committed to his own two-year extension … In an ideal world I’d like to see Matuidi or Dortmund’s Weigl in red and white, but Arsène’s not about to concede that Xhaka was a £35m ricket. As a statement of the club’s intent, the most crucial signings are those of Sánchez and Özil on new contracts. Bernard Azulay goonersdiary.co.uk, @GoonerN5 Bournemouth There are three areas we need to look at. First, a solid, experienced keeper. Artur Boruc has played well but back strains are a problem, and Adam Federici doesn’t fill the goal as much – so someone like Joe Hart would make a huge impact. Second, an attacking midfielder like Wilfried Zaha: a fast, creative talent who can change a game. And third, a striker with the energy of Divock Origi. Not much to ask? Peter Bell afcbchimes.blogspot.co.uk, @CherryChimes Burnley We’ll be focusing on squad strengthening as much as anything, but I’d specifically like to see another central midfielder, and a wide player with a bit of pace. We were close to filling both those gaps at the end of August with Brighton’s Dale Stephens and Polish winger Kamil Grosicki from Rennes, but the deals fell through. It’d be no surprise to see Stephens back on the winter shopping list, though: he’s out of contract in the summer – that’ll put Brighton under pressure this month. Tony Scholes uptheclarets.com, @utcdotcom Chelsea As things stand, we’re looking great – but you do have to wonder how many injuries we are away from a serious problem. The defence is certainly vulnerable: we have two war-horses on the bench but they’d struggle to play in a three, so Conte has to look for more resources. It’s a shame that Leonardo Bonucci signed a new Juventus deal. Elsewhere, and this may not be a popular view, but I also think we need to start a search to replace Victor Moses. He’s played better than most expected but he has his limitations. I also wonder whether we’ll be searching for a striker as Batshuayi didn’t get his chance despite Costa being suspended. Conte has stressed that his time will come, but will the youngster be willing to wait? And finally, as important as buying new options is retaining the talent we have – Cesc Fàbregas specifically. It’s difficult to buy that sort of quality these days. Trizia Fiorellino chelseasupportersgroup.net Crystal Palace We have all sorts of problems but a striker is probably the most urgent given Connor Wickham’s long-term injury. As it stands, Fraizer Campbell is the only back-up to Benteke, which isn’t a good place to be. The defence needs a proper overhaul too, with Pape Souaré out injured and the rest of the backline having looked fairly clueless. At a minimum, by the end of January we need to have a new attacking left-back ready to go – Kieran Gibbs, Charlie Taylor or Neil Taylor? And it seems like Allardyce is also after a midfield enforcer, with the club’s scouts busy in Ligue 1. Chris Waters palacetrust.org.uk, @Clapham_Grand Everton The way we faltered after that strong start shows we need to strengthen all over the pitch if we’re going to make progress. A new keeper would be an obvious place for Ronald Koeman to start: ideally Pickford from Sunderland or Heaton from Burnley, but most of the talk at the moment is about outfield players, including Charlton’s Ademola Lookman and United’s Morgan Schneiderlin. Whatever happens, we need some options to replace Barry and Jagielka: they’ve been great servants, but it’s a young man’s game. Steve Jones @bluekippercom Hull City There isn’t a single outfield position that doesn’t need improving – but a proper right-back and someone to put the ball in the net are key. With his nous and obvious threat, Peter Crouch would be useful – and Scott Hogan at Brentford is a good finisher who’d be a better long-term investment. Elsewhere, if we’re going to continue to play with three centre-halves, we need another one – like Sunderland found in Lamine Koné. And all this is assuming we keep hold of Snodgrass, Robertson and other players linked with moves. We just can’t go through what we went through in the summer again when we lost Mo Diamé, despite already being critically short of players. Rick Skelton boothferrytowembley.blogspot.com, @HullCityLive Leicester City We desperately need a new centre-back to offer some decent cover in case Morgan or Huth get injured. Michael Keane has been touted, and we could do worse. Similarly, we need another winger to compensate for Riyad Mahrez’s Africa Cup of Nations duties. But most importantly, we need a ball-winning midfielder to try to fill the N’Golo Kanté hole – thankfully, it sounds like a deal is pretty much done for Wilfred Ndidi from Genk. Hopefully, we’ll have time to find a new head of recruitment too. Chris Whiting thechriswhitingshow.wordpress.com, @ChrisRWhiting Liverpool Even though we’ve been scoring freely we do need a top striker. Coutinho is likely to get knocked about and miss games throughout the season, Mané is off to the Africa Cup of Nations and we can’t rely on Sturridge. Celtic’s Moussa Dembélé has been linked, but not only with us, and there’s talk about PSG’s Jesé Rodriguez. We could also do with a defender: Newcastle’s Jamaal Lascelles was linked before Christmas – Rafa won’t be happy – and a left-back, with Ricardo Rodríguez from Wolfsburg and Cologne’s Jonas Hector mentioned. Elsewhere, our keepers have struggled, but Karius is young and can hopefully learn and improve. Quickly, with luck. Steph Jones Observer reader Manchester City Our defence is a mess - the problems won’t be solved in one window, but signing Virgil van Dijk from Southampton would be a big step in the right direction. Meanwhile, Ilkay Gündogan’s injury is a massive blow, so a move for another midfielder could be on the cards. It sounds like we’re close on Sevilla’s Steven N’Zonzi, but I hope we’re also serious about Mahmoud Dahoud. He’s undoubtedly a star in the making and has impressed whenever we’ve played Mönchengladbach. Lloyd Scragg mcfcwatch.com, @lloyd_scragg Manchester United We haven’t been scoring enough. There’s been some encouraging talk about a big bid for Antoine Griezmann, who’d be one of the final pieces in José’s jigsaw, but that won’t happen this month. So Mourinho may go for another option – possibly young Kasper Dolberg from Ajax – given that Martial, Rooney and Rashford haven’t been delivering. To do that, though, he’ll probably have to offload some fringe players such as Fellaini, Memphis and Schneiderlin – particularly if he’s also serious about spending big money on Benfica defender Victor Lindelof. Shaun O’Donnell Observer reader Middlesbrough We have to try to strengthen in attack and midfield, and focus on bringing in experience – we look so vulnerable whenever Ramírez and Negredo are missing. We’ve not been shy to add quality players in previous January windows, and I think we’ll see a bold survival strategy emerge this month. It has taken us seven years to get back to this level and we’ll throw everything we can at staying in the top-flight. Rudy Gestede would give us another option, though I think most fans would prefer some more dynamic signings. Could we have the manager to realise the untapped potential of Everton’s Gerard Deulofeu? We’d then have former Barça youth players attacking down both flanks. Robert Nichols fmttm.com, @rob_fmttm Southampton What do we need this month? A striker who scores goals. Literally any striker who scores goals. Spend all the money we have on Daniel Sturridge if he’s willing and available. Add a fit and clinical goalscorer to the mix – and keep hold of Virgil van Dijk at the back – and we’re a potential top-six side again. Steve Grant saintsweb.co.uk, @SteveGrant1983 Stoke City Lee Grant and Bruno Martins Indi should be first in on permanent deals: they’ve been instrumental. Beyond those two, we all thought Bony was going to be the answer to our scoring issues but that really hasn’t worked out – so expect interest in Saido Berahino (again), RB Leipzig’s Davie Selke, or Napoli’s Manolo Gabbiadini. Elsewhere, if there’s a player out there who could challenge Erik Pieters at left back we should be looking at him. As good as Eric is he does suffer from having no competition for his place whatsoever. And Jack Butland’s ongoing injury problems mean another keeper, alongside Lee Grant, could be on the cards. Rob Holloway Observer reader Sunderland A big month for David Moyes coming up. We’re told there’s a limited budget but we need at least two more defenders. Carl Jenkinson has been mentioned, but we’ll need another centre-back too as Koné will be missing one way or the other – either sold, or off on Africa Cup of Nations duties. Elsewhere we have to do whatever it takes to hang on to Jermain Defoe – we could do without Sam Allardyce and Slaven Bilic distracting him. Other than that, I guess we’ll be checking to see if there are any out-of-contract former Everton players knocking around – and it wouldn’t come as a big surprise if Peter Crouch pitched up. But not Dimitar Berbatov – far too pricey for a low wage economy like ours. Pete Sixsmith SalutSunderland.com Swansea City The first half of the season was a disaster; to turn this round the new manager has to make multiple changes. Among the most urgent needs are a centre-back to replace Ashley Williams, at least one full-back and a winger – but we could also do with a decent central midfielder to replace the substandard Ki Sung-yueng. Realistically, though, it’s hard to imagine us managing to land more than three players this month, given the state we’re in. Kevin Elphick Swansea.vitalfootball.co.uk Tottenham Hotspur Pochettino talks about how we need “more quality” even though our squad is very strong, with a tight wage structure. We could use some extra creativity, pace and goal threat – but then who couldn’t use those qualities? Wilfried Zaha would be interesting – but to improve what we already have is a tall ask with a new stadium to finance. Dave Mason Observer reader Watford Our squad is as strong as it’s ever been, and the signings of Okaka, Success and Pereyra giving us an attacking armoury we didn’t have last term. However, Pereyra’s injury – combined with the impending losses of Amrabat and Guedioura to the Africa Cup of Nations – mean that we need at least temporary cover in attacking midfield positions. Matt Rowson bhappy.wordpress.com, @mattrowson West Bromwich Albion We still lack strength in depth and we’re a couple injuries away from relying on players who would struggle. There’s been lots of talk about Morgan Schneiderlin, but the biggest concern is cover for Salomón Rondón. That’s the key area that needs strengthening. We were linked with Rudy Gestede but it sounds like he’s off to Boro. Richard Jefferson wbaunofficial.org.uk/forum, @richbaggie West Ham United A proven Premier League striker who can remain fit is essential this month – Christian Benteke would have done the job, but as it is we’re apparently after loan options. Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Michy Batshuayi have all been mentioned. We’re also after another right back – Carl Jenkinson from Arsenal? – and, if Payet goes, another creator, too. We’d love a fit Santi Cazorla in exchange, but Gylfi Sigurdsson of Swansea always strikes me as an underrated player.

Expectations were fulfilled and The Trouble With Goats and Sheep became a bestseller; less foreseeable was quite how prescient this winning parable would come to seem over the course of the year. The action centres on the baking summer of 1976 and while heatwaves have been the focus of other debuts – The Cement Garden most (in)famously – the weather here is skilfully promoted from backdrop to insidious personality: oppressive; coercive; according to some of the residents of “the avenue” responsible for all kinds of strange behaviour. However, we soon realise that there is more to the disappearance of No 8’s Mrs Creasy than a rush of blood to the head, and that conspiracy, not borrowed cups of sugar, has been holding the neighbourhood together. The novel alternates between the perspectives of the avenue’s adult residents and the first-person narration of 10-year-old bright-spark Grace, whose precocity is robust enough to offset suspicions of feyness, in spite of her fondness for Angel Delight. Along with her sidekick, Tilly, she decides to track down the missing woman, a mission that is part public service, part divine duty: “sheep need a shepherd to keep them safe. The vicar said so,” she informs her mother. It hardly needs saying that the book’s sheep and goats, sinners and saints, turn out not to be separate species but one and the same. Moreover Cannon, a psychiatric doctor, suggests economically and with sensitivity the secrets, shame and sorrow that lurk behind every net curtain, as well as the toxicity of the mob, the us-and-them mentality that festers throughout the book. Even its moments of out-of-the-mouths-of-babes humour come with a subtle reminder, elsewhere, that it is not just phrases but prejudices that young minds pick up. Although the book’s messages – of acceptance, empathy and compassion – are unmistakable, it is never preachy; plot and structure are deftly, cleverly handled and descriptions combine delicacy with flair, perhaps most notably in the case of “a river of starlings… spinning out their harmony across a bleached sky”. With its combination of wit and heart, it’s easy to see why Cannon’s tale earned so many fans; with its implicit plea for understanding it will doubtless continue to add them in the months to come. •&nbsp;The Trouble With Goats and Sheep by Joanna Cannon is published by The Borough Press (£7.99).

Whenever possible I like to take a print back to give to those I’ve documented, and in my bag I have a photograph I took of the couple two years before. But should I give it to them? In the picture Khouloud, paralysed from the neck down, lies in the tent she shares with her family in Lebanon’s Bekaa valley. Jamal sits at the end of her bed, holding her hand, the couple looking at each other with a love that is at odds with the stark, grainy black-and-white image that reflects the truth of their desperate situation. If there is one image that betrays my belief in the power of photography to create change, it’s this one. For here we are, two years later, sitting in that same dark oppressive tent and nothing has changed. Naively perhaps, I’d believed that telling Khouloud’s story would have made a difference, and I can’t help feeling I failed them. Finally, I reach down and take the photograph out of my bag. As I hand it to them I say: “When I took this two years ago, I didn’t take a photograph of a refugee, I didn’t take a photograph of a disabled woman; instead I took a photograph of a couple who are deeply in love, and that’s what this will always mean to me.” In 2014 I went to Lebanon with Handicap International to document some of Syria’s most vulnerable refugees. The sick, the elderly, single-parent families and those living with disabilities. People like 38-year-old Reem. She was in bed at home in Idlib, Syria, when a rocket hit her house. Her husband was killed next to her, one of her children also died, and Reem lost a leg. When I met her she was living in a tent on the top floor of an unfinished building. She was still learning to use her prosthesis and was unable to use the stairs, leaving her trapped. She didn’t want her surviving children to live with her – she felt ashamed because she believed her disability meant she couldn’t be a mother to them. Only her father, Abdel, lived with her on the rooftop. As I was taking his photograph, Abdel kept looking to the side, his eyes focused on the distant snow-capped mountains. I asked why he kept looking that way. “Those mountains,” he replied, “are my home. I am an old man and may never return home, but at least each morning it’s the first thing I see, and when I go to bed the last.” Over the following weeks I met dozens of Syrians like Reem, fighting for survival and dignity as refugees in Lebanon. In 2014 the situation was already desperate, with over a million Syrians sheltering in a county of just four million. The infrastructure was close to collapse. Recovering from a life-changing accident myself (in 2011 I was injured while working in Afghanistan), that trip to Lebanon and the people I met were to have a profound effect both on my life and my work. But it was in meeting Khouloud – and, later, a girl called Aya – that I would find true inspiration and a renewed purpose for my photography In 2013 Khouloud, 32, was working in her garden with her children when a sniper shot her through the spine. She collapsed, paralysed from the neck down. “I tried to plant a small area of land near our house as it wasn’t possible to get vegetables like before,” she said. “I was taking care of the plants with my four children and suddenly a bullet hit my neck and I fell down and lost sensation. I could not move any more.” After her initial treatment her family managed to get her out of Syria. Eventually they found themselves living in an informal tented settlement in Lebanon’s Bekaa valley, one of thousands of unofficial camps dotted across the country. When we met she’d been there for five months. The UNHCR was providing food coupons but the family was struggling. Her husband has to provide Khouloud with 24-hour care. I asked her: “What’s your hope for the future?” “To be a mother again,” she replied. “I wish I could move my fingers because sometimes my son is injured outside and he comes in next to me. He moves my hand and he puts my fingers on to the wound. I wish I could move my fingers to touch him and make him feel like I am feeling the wound with him.” What struck me was the love within that family. Despite everything they had been through and the incredible suffering they still endured, there was laughter, hope and affection. They treated me like a family member. Despite having so little, they cooked and shared what they had. When I met Aya she was sitting alone on a concrete floor in a dark, damp tent. She has spina bifida, which means she is paralysed from the waist down and the curvature in her spin makes it hard to sit upright unaided. She was four years old. Seeing her there, I thought I couldn’t take her photograph. She seemed so vulnerable, and that goes against the way I like to work. Yet Aya was to prove me wrong. She turned out to be the feistiest four-year-old I’d ever met. I spent the day with her family, and her mother, Sihan, told me about Aya’s relationship with her sister, Iman. The two were inseparable. When their house in Idlib was bombed, it was Iman, only 10 herself, who held Aya in the basement where they sheltered for three days. With no food or water, she never let her sister go. Then, on the perilous journey from Syria to Lebanon, which took them several weeks, it was Iman who carried Aya. Iman walked into the tent while we were talking, and I expected to see that tenderness. Instead, Aya looked up at her sister and exclaimed “Pick me up, Donkey!” Over the coming weeks I revisited them and – as with Khouloud and her family – witnessed the strength of their love and unity. One of the hardest things was listening to Aya’s father, Ayman, talking about the possibility of splitting his family up. Things were so desperate: living in a makeshift tent, the children often sick, he not allowed to work because of his refugee status, the family sinking further and further into debt, and Aya not getting the medical support she desperately needed. The other children weren’t attending school and Ayman was considering sending them to live with others. Their most immediate concern was whether Aya would survive the winter. On my last day there, as the family attempted to winter-proof their tent with materials supplied by the UNHCR, Sihan was in tears as she told me that she doubted Aya could survive these hardships. But Aya had other thoughts. She interrupted her mother to exclaim with typical defiance: “Aya doesn’t die!” In the end I did take a photograph of Aya. It was of her playing hopscotch with Iman. She is laughing, and in that moment you see her strength and passion for life. After returning home I often thought of the families I’d met. Some I managed to stay in contact with. Others, I had no idea of their fate. Then, in 2015, the UNHCR commissioned me to document the refugee crisis across Europe and the Middle East. Its brief was simple: “Follow your heart.” The project began in Lesbos, documenting scenes we are all too familiar with. I followed the refugees’ journey to Berlin, criss-crossing Europe, trying to record stories. However, I knew that if I was to fully fulfil my brief and follow my heart, I’d have to return to Lebanon. So in February 2016 I went back. I visited Aya and her family. They had moved out of the tent and, thanks to assistance from the UNHCR, were now living in a rented room on the outskirts of Tripoli. It wasn’t much, but at least it provided proper shelter, and the children seemed much healthier. Aya was her normal feisty self and had grown up so much. Her new hobby was painting her nails and trying out hairstyles. I photographed her being pushed around in her wheelchair by her brothers, screaming “Faster! Faster!” I have some understanding of the pain that she is in each day and her struggles with disability – yet I have never heard her complain. Life was still hard. What support the family received barely covered rent and food. While the kids could attend school, often they missed classes because the family could not pay the bus fare. Ayman still wasn’t allowed to work. Many days were spent sitting around the house. The family, like most refugees, were stuck in limbo. When I first met Aya’s family they talked of returning to Syria as soon as possible. After over five years of war, they were now questioning if they could ever return. And even if they did, what would be left? The schools, hospitals and businesses lie in ruins; their own house is destroyed. What future would they have? With the prospects of a return to Syria dwindling and life in Lebanon impossible, their hope now was for resettlement. “I never wanted to go to Europe, so far from Syria,” Ayman said, “but if this gives my children a chance of a future, then I will go.” They had been put forward by the UNHCR for resettlement in France, but months had passed and still no news. They were losing hope. I also returned to see Reem. I was happy to see she was now able to negotiate the stairs, and her daughter, Sarah, was living with her again. That evening I sat with the family (Reem’s two brothers had joined her, living on the roof-top), drinking coffee and eating homemade bread from the open fire. In so many ways, life was normal. The family joked and laughed, reminisced about life back in Syria, discussed food and football. But for the refugees living in Lebanon, nothing is normal. Like Aya’s family they were stuck, unable to build new lives or plan futures. I managed to track down most of those I’d met on my first visit, but in the chaos it was hard to trace everyone. On my last day I got a phone call. It was Khouloud’s family. She’d heard I was back and wanted me to visit. When I asked where she was living, I was told she was in the same tent I’d seen her in two years before. I felt like I’d been punched in the stomach. How could she still be living in that tent? Of all those I’d visited in 2014, Khouloud’s situation had seemed the most desperate. A tetraplegic woman living in a makeshift tent with her husband as full-time carer. I’d told her story and yet nothing had changed. I felt as if I had failed them. I extended my stay in Lebanon and went to see them. For over two years Khouloud had not moved from her bed, staring at the ceiling of the one room that they lived in. Yet still she remained positive; full of laughter and knowing smiles. Jamal still looked at her with, he said, all the love he had when they first met. The children do their homework on the bed with their mother, and they always eat together as a family. Astonishingly, the tent was a place filled with positivity, laughter and kindness. Over the days that followed I tried to capture that story through my photographs, I wanted to tell their story again. On the last day I gave them that photograph I’d taken two years before – with the promise that this time I’d make sure people heard their story. Just a few months later, in August 2016, I was in San Francisco, giving a talk. The idea was to raise funds and awareness of the crisis in Lebanon. After the talk I received an email from Philip Schneider, who manages the global community event Gishwhes and is also on the board of a charity called Random Acts. Set up by American actor Misha Collins in 2010, Random Acts has a simple mission statement: “Conquer the world, one random act of kindness at a time.” Key to its work is a network of connected people who use social media to raise awareness and help individuals and communities. After seeing the photographs and hearing the stories of Aya and Khouloud at the talk, Schneider was so moved that he wanted to combine the Gishwhes and Random Acts networks to see what could be done to help. Things moved fast. They set up a crowdfunding page, and the combined online communities started donating and spreading the word. “In situations like these, it’s hard to know how one can help,” wrote Schneider on their website, “but Gishwhes and Random Acts have decided that while we may not be able to solve Syria’s problems, making some small impact is better than standing idly by, doing nothing. Therefore, we have narrowed the scope and we are going to radically change the material situation of a few families that have suffered tremendously from this conflict.” In the days and weeks that followed, I sat glued to their fundraiser page. From over 20 countries, hundreds of people donated, often just 10 or 20 dollars. But the impact of so many people coming together to create change was dramatic. Within a month, over $200,000 was raised. Random Acts is now in the process of moving Khouloud and other families in Lebanon into flats, getting them medical treatment and making sure a trust is set up so the children can attend school until they are 18. No matter what your political persuasion, it can’t be denied that, in 2016, compassion, tolerance and empathy took a beating. But this generosity and compassion is inspiring. The issues of the world can seem overwhelming but – even if just for a few families – this proves that the kindness of strangers can change lives. Around the same time I received further good news: as part of UNHCR’s resettlement scheme, Aya and her family were to start a new life in France. They’d be leaving Lebanon in less than two weeks. Sihan, Aya’s mother, fretted about what they should take. They were allowed a suitcase each, and into those she packed blankets (for she had been told it was cold) and bags of dried thyme, cumin and Arabic coffee (she wanted to carry a taste of home). None of them had flown before. When they boarded the plane in Beirut the family was terrified. Apart from Aya, who, I’m told, did up her seat belt and said “Let’s go!” A few days later I visited them at their new home in Laval, an hour’s drive from Paris. Their flat is in a new block on the edge of a small town. It’s quiet, with gardens where the children can play. Random Acts helped provide Aya with a state-of-the-art wheelchair, and for the first time in her life she can fulfil her dream of attending school. Eating dinner with the family, I realised, that despite knowing them for over two years, it was the first time I’d seen Aya’s parents smile. It was as if a great weight had been lifted from them. As I was leaving, Sihan told me with tears in her eyes, about the first night they slept in their new flat. Aya often struggles to sleep, but on that night, as she put Aya to bed, Sihan was able to whisper to her: “It’s OK, this is your home now.”','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/01/syria-disabled-refugees-update-giles-duley-photography','Giles Duley, photojournalist: ‘I promised my pictures could help Syrian war victims.

But we must believe it. Or, if not quite believe it, at least entertain the notion for the next few minutes. 2017 certainly hasn’t been as bad as 2016’s worst doom-mongers would have had us believe. After all, a human still lives to write this, and several others to read it. So it’s been much better than many expected. And even a real glass-half-empty type would have to admit that, regrettable though&nbsp;events on the international stage have been, what we’ve just undergone was really quite a small nuclear war. I’m joking of course, because, as we know from our recent attempts to have a nuclear war, nuclear weapons turn out never to have existed – or only briefly. It seems the original plans for the atom bomb were destroyed to prevent them falling into the hands of the Area 51 alien, who didn’t actually have any hands, just sort of suckers, and was subsequently discovered not to be an alien but an incredibly inaccurate model of the Michelin man constructed out of cork by a midwestern garage owner based on instructions he’d been given on a crackly phone line in French. So, for most of the nuclear age, the notion of the weapons themselves was just a conspiracy by the rulers of the world’s leading nations to siphon off large sections of their respective defence budgets to spend on canapés. As a rogue CIA agent confessed on a YouTube video he released just before disappearing into the Cloud via a bizarre human-body-uploader he’d made out of a Portaloo, a liquidiser and a modem: “There are only two secrets you need to know: nuclear weapons don’t exist and unicorns do. Their livers can be made into stratospherically expensive pate.” Needless to say, this has made 2017 nearly as embarrassing for conspiracy theorists as 2016 was for opinion pollsters. “Heaven forbid that you’d suspect anything nice!” remarked Ian Hislop on Have I Got News for You in October. “Oh no! It’s all got to be ‘No one’s really landed on the moon!’ or ‘Princess Diana was murdered’ or ‘The world’s run by a secret cabal of lizards’ by which you basically mean Jews but it goes down better if you say lizards. But when it turns out nuclear weapons don’t exist and unicorns do, you missed it because you were too busy looking for evidence that 9/11 was actually a Top Gear stunt that got out of hand!” It’s unclear how many times President Trump had pressed the nuclear button before admitting that nothing seemed to be happening, but he gave several speeches throughout the spring with a noticeably reddened thumb. Military historians will be debating the consequences of the anticlimactic third world war for decades, and its impact on the dystopian fiction genre is incalculable, but here are some of the lighter news events of the year that may have escaped your attention. Truth comes at a price on Google From September onwards, the first search result that came up for anyone Googling the word “truth” was a paid-for ad defining it as an “outmoded and discredited concept”. The cybergiant refused to disclose who was financing the ad on the basis of “professional ethics”, a phrase that, if itself Googled, gives the result: “lucrative non-disclosure agreement”. Julian Assange was initially suspected but he said that it couldn’t be him because “the embassy has changed the Wi-Fi code again. I’ve been trying to guess it for weeks.” Michael Gove also denied that he had anything to do with the ad, claiming: “I’m desperately trying to dissociate myself from all that and get some TV formats away.” Sir Richard Branson launches new item of cutlery “It’s been an awkward threesome for centuries,” said Branson at the launch of the Any-Tine. “Knife, fork, spoon. It’s as wobbly as a three-legged stool. Let’s bring some balance.” Described as “a breakthrough in the field of scooping prongs”, the Any-Tine looks like a double-corkscrew, with strange wide sections ending in three vicious sharp points. “I wanted to get inside cutlery’s DNA – and how better to do that than with a piece of cutlery that looks like the structure of DNA?” the billionaire asked. Lawyers for the Any-Tine effusively denied they’d had any initial discussions with the owners of the patent for the spork. Channel 4 buys the Queen’s speech The BBC and ITV were left with egg on their faces when Channel 4 signed a £60m 100-year deal with the newly formed Royal Palaces plc to make and broadcast the sovereign’s Christmas message. Confusion arose, however, when Her Majesty announced her intention to remain with the BBC. “I wish the show well, but my loyalties lie with non-commercial broadcasting,” said the Queen, who was believed to be in the running for a new reality format featuring Michael Gove and being developed by Endemol. “Working title: Gove Fucks It Up,” said the company’s head of development. “Each week, the Queen sends Gove on an important mission and he does what he does best: ruins everything.” Hollywood to release remakes first “It is a work of accounting genius,” explained a Hollywood insider. “Statistically, remakes do the business. They make much more money, on average, than films that aren’t remakes. Perhaps not quite as much as the films that warrant being remade but that’s a detail. The irrefutable fact is that the remake is the most profitable form of film. So they’ve got to be released first. We make a film, bury it, remake it, release the remake – then we can stick the original on YouTube or as a DVD extra, who cares? It is literally innumerate to claim this will not work.” Britain becomes last member state of the European Union Our former European partners stole a march on us in February by all simultaneously triggering article 50 and leaving the EU a fortnight later, leaving Britain the only remaining member of an organisation it long ago resolved to leave. “Brexit means Brexit,” said Theresa May as usual. “We will leave. We’re determined to leave. But obviously it now falls to us to wind down its various institutions first. Needless to say, this will all be very expensive. I would cancel Trident but, as you know, we rather blew all that on unicorn liver pate for President Trump’s state visit.”','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/01/my-grateful-dispatches-from-the-end-of-2017-nuclear-weapons-michael-gove','My grateful dispatches from the end of 2017… | David Mitchell',105,'commentisfree'),('sport/2017/jan/01/rugby-uinon-six-to-watch-in-2017-young-players','Joey Carbery Leinster, fly-half. Age 21 Joey Carbery started the year playing for Clontarf and finished it with three caps, the first coming against New Zealand in Chicago when he replaced Jonny Sexton with 22 minutes to go and coolly guided his forwards around the field to help Ireland achieve a historic victory over the All Blacks. His first start for Leinster had come two months before but Carbery kept his nerve and played with an assurance beyond his years. He was promoted early because Ian Madigan became fed up with understudying Sexton and moved to France and Paddy Jackson was unavailable for the international in America. Carbery, who was born in New Zealand but moved to Ireland when he was 11, is a fly-half who stands flat and maximises his attacking options. It took him three minutes on his first full appearance for Leinster in September to announce himself, receiving the ball on his own 10-metre line against Treviso and confounding three defenders to score the first of two tries. Ireland have a succession plan for Sexton. Keelan Giles Ospreys, wing. Age 18 Keelan Giles turns 19 at the end of January having become the most talked about player in Wales in the autumn. He sat on the bench against Japan but did not come on, because victory was only secured in the final minute. His scoring rate for his region is more than one try a match and he has notched five in six appearances for Wales Under-20s. Comparisons have been made with Shane Williams – quick footwork and acceleration and he is deceptively strong. It is a case of when he makes his international debut, with Wales inviting him to train with the team at the end of last summer’s tour to New Zealand, after the Junior World Cup, to integrate him early. Japan looked the perfect opportunity with Wales picking experienced three-quarters in Jamie Roberts, Jonathan Davies and Leigh Halfpenny, but a change in playing style from wallop to gallop has bred an initial uncertainty and he was held in reserve. The Wales coaches need to make a statement to show players they mean what they say and Giles lining up in Rome at the start of the Six Nations would be a loud declaration of intent. Joe Marchant Harlequins, outside-centre. Age 20 Joe Marchant plays like a No13 of old, quick feet and a burst of pace, looking to attack defenders on their outside shoulder. The World Rugby Under-20 Championship final between England and Ireland was ignited by Marchant, who scored a try from 40 metres, stepping out of one tackle and then another before accelerating away. He has profited from the experience around him at Harlequins, where he has Jamie Roberts and Nick Evans inside and Mike Brown outside, but he is a player who lives off his wits, as he showed when picking up a bouncing ball near his own line against Worcester and sidestepping two tacklers to reach the safety of the 22. Marchant is in a position where England are hardly struggling for options but, having been called into the 45-man elite player squad on Saturday, he is clearly impressing Eddie Jones, who has talked about the need to work on England’s attack. In Marchant, he has a merchant of menace. Christian Scotland-Williamson Worcester, second-row. Age 23 Worcester surprised many when they included Scotland-Williamson in their second row at Bristol instead of the vastly more experienced Donncha O’Callaghan. The club’s academy product, who missed most of the past two seasons with a back problem that required surgery, was one of the few Warriors who were up for the relegation fight, scrapping for possession and looking to get his hands on the ball. At 6ft 9in and more than 19st, he is one of the more imposing forwards in the top flight but injury slowed his progress and he made his Premiership debut this season. Second row is another position where England have ample resources but Jones is not a coach who is ever satisfied. He will be using England’s summer tour to Argentina to look at the next generation of players and someone impressing in a struggling side will not be lost on him. Scotland-Williamson has been compared to Courtney Lawes with his ability to make dents in defences and haul down ball-carriers, big, strong and athletic. Billy Searle Bristol, fly-half. Age 20 Billy Searle joined Bristol’s academy in the summer after moving from Plymouth Albion. The intention was to blood him in the Anglo-Welsh Cup but a series of injuries at 10, including their recruit Shane Geraghty, led to him starting in the European Challenge Cup at Bath and he has taken the field in seven of Bristol’s last eight matches, including last week’s basement fight against Worcester despite the return of Tusi Pisi, who was moved to the centre. Searle quickly made an impact, using space created by defenders tightly marking Will Hurrell to make a break and set up Tom Varndell for the first of the wing’s three tries. If Searle showed signs of inexperience towards the end, throwing risky passes when the need was to keep the lead, he had more than proved his worth, varying his game and dictating in a way his opposite number was unable to, despite having a man advantage for most of the match. He is a modern outside-half and it is no coincidence that since his elevation, Varndell is scoring tries again. Thomas Young Wasps, flanker. Age 24 Thomas Young has been overlooked by Wales despite his outstanding club form and a footballing ability his country is crying out for. Perhaps it would be different if he were a three-quarter but Wales are at a point where, looking to boost their regional game, they are placing a quota on players who are based outside their country. Size was used as an argument against Young, who stands less than 6ft, but as emphasis shifts to use of the ball it should be time for a rethink. Young has the handling skills, adept at drawing tacklers and off-loading, he has pace and he has a breakaway’s instinct for being in the right place. There is more than a touch of Martyn Williams about him, a constant link between forwards and backs. He is the perfect fit for Wasps, who look to capitalise in broken play, and if Wales are serious about overhauling their style of play will it make sense to keep overlooking him, even with Justin Tipuric in their squad?','https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/01/rugby-uinon-six-to-watch-in-2017-young-players','Six young rugby union players poised to make an impact in 2017 | Paul Rees',106,'sport'),('politics/2017/jan/01/universal-basic-income-trials-being-considered-in-scotland','Scotland looks set to be the first part of the UK to pilot a basic income for every citizen, as councils in Fife and Glasgow investigate trial schemes in 2017. The councillor Matt Kerr has been championing the idea through the ornate halls of Glasgow City Chambers, and is frank about the challenges it poses. “Like a lot of people, I was interested in the idea but never completely convinced,” he said. But working as Labour’s anti-poverty lead on the council, Kerr says that he “kept coming back to the basic income”. Kerr sees the basic income as a way of simplifying the UK’s byzantine welfare system. “But it is also about solidarity: it says that everyone is valued and the government will support you. It changes the relationship between the individual and the state.” The concept of a universal basic income revolves around the idea of offering every individual, regardless of existing welfare benefits or earned income, a non-conditional flat-rate payment, with any income earned above that taxed progressively. The intention is to provide a basic economic platform on which people can build their lives, whether they choose to earn, learn, care or set up a business. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has suggested that it is likely to appear in his party’s next manifesto, while there has been a groundswell of interest among anti-poverty groups who see it as a means of changing not only the relationship between people and the state, but between workers and increasingly insecure employment in the gig economy. Kerr accepts that, while he is hopeful of cross-party support in Glasgow, there are “months of work ahead”, including first arranging a feasibility study in order to present a strong enough evidence base for a pilot. “But if there is ever a case to be made then you need to test it in a place like Glasgow, with the sheer numbers and levels of health inequality. If you can make it work here then it can work anywhere.” The idea has its roots in 16th-century humanist philosophy, when it was developed by the likes of Thomas More, but in its modern incarnation it has lately enjoyed successful pilots in India and Africa. Despite its utopian roots, champions believe that this is an idea whose time has come, particularly in Scotland where the governing SNP voted in support of a basic income at their spring conference (although the proposal has yet to make it into their manifesto). At the heart of any experiment with basic income is money: how much should people get and where will it come from? Kerr says his instinct is to base the amount on similar calculations to those made for the living wage. “It’s about having more than just enough to pay the bills. But part of the idea of doing a pilot is to make mistakes and also find out what is acceptable to the public. There will be a lot of resistance to this. We shouldn’t kid ourselves. Part of the problem is we’re working against a whole discourse of deserving and undeserving poor.” As for where the money comes from, “the funding question is always the big one, and really will depend upon the approach a pilot takes,” says Jamie Cooke, head of RSA Scotland, which has been spearheading research on the subject across the UK. Drawing on the experience of similar projects ongoing in Finland, Utrecht in the Netherland and Ontario in Canada, Cooke suggests: “It could be funding from particular trusts, it could be individual philanthropic funding, as we have seen in the States, or it could be a redirection of the existing welfare spend.” Obviously the latter is much harder to do in a pilot, although that will be happening in Finland next year where the experiment is being taken forward by the national government. As the Scottish government consults on what it has described as “the biggest transfer of powers since devolution began” – the devolution of around £2.7bn, or 15% of the total Scottish benefits bill, affecting 1.4 million people – both Kerr and Cooke believe that this is an ideal moment to consider the basic income seriously. “It’s a time to be testing out new – or rather old – ideas for a welfare system that genuinely supports independence,” says Kerr. Cooke likewise believes that cross-party support is key, pointing to the fact that the leader of the Conservative group on Fife council has joined forces with the Fairer Fife Commission, the council’s independent poverty advisory group which initially recommended the trial, with the aim of designing a pilot within the next six months. Scotland was recently added to the list of “places to watch” for basic income activity by the Basic Income Earth Network, founded by the radical economist Guy Standing, whose hugely influential book The Precariat identified an emerging social class suffering the worst of job insecurity and most likely to be attracted to rightwing populism. “The thing about Scotland is that they really understand the precariat,” says Standing, who recently visited the country to meet civil servants, local authorities and campaigners to discuss a basic income. “The sense of insecurity, the stagnating living standards, all of those things are clear in Scotland and the fact that so many within the SNP are supportive means there’s a real opportunity to do a pilot in Scotland.” The momentum is there, he says, and once it is framed around a desire for greater social justice “then you get away from the stale debate about whether if you give people the basic income then they will be lazy”. “People relate to the idea that everyone should have a social dividend. Everywhere I go, it’s the communities that feel left behind by globalisation that are most interested [in the idea of a basic income]. We have seen a sea-change in attitudes. “This sense of alarm about populist rightwing politics has brought more people to thinking we need to do something to provide better security for people. We are risking our economic and political stability if we don’t do something about it.”','https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/01/universal-basic-income-trials-being-considered-in-scotland','Universal basic income trials being considered in Scotland',107,'politics'),('stage/2017/jan/01/rising-stars-2017-actor-morfydd-clark-cordelia','In her professional debut, Morfydd Clark was upstaged by a lamb. She’d nabbed the title part in Blodeuwedd – “it’s the Welsh Juliet” – staged on a Snowdonian hillside in 2013. But as if elaborate Welsh-language poetry and swarms of midges weren’t challenging enough, one evening “this lamb came on – it was in July when they’re really not little and cute anymore – and baaa-ed loudly through the love scene.” Lamb aside, Clark has had little problem holding her own on stage, and these days her fellow performers include Glenda Jackson, Dominic West and Rhys Ifans. She’s played the actual Juliet opposite Freddie Fox’s Romeo, won praise from critics in Gary Owen’s Violence and Son at the Royal Court, and starred in Les Liaisons Dangereuses at the Donmar. She rounded off 2016 by playing Cordelia opposite Glenda Jackson’s King Lear at the Old Vic. “I knew her as a politician and found her fascinating; she wiped the floor with anyone, because she can perform,” says Clark, who was thrilled to play her daughter, especially getting a “cuddle” each night while playing dead. Do we need to see more gender-blind casting? “With Shakespeare, there’s no reason not to,” Clark insists, before adding that it’s no substitute for writing towering parts for women. “I want men to be asking to play great female parts!” Still, she’s had no problem winning juicy roles, and they keep her coming back to the theatre. Clark has given notable screen performances in The Falling and opposite Kate Beckinsale in Love &amp; Friendship, but while she loves films, “as a girl, often the characters you’re auditioning for in the theatre are more significant”. She was raised in Cardiff, and dropped out of school at 16, having struggled with dyslexia and ADHD. “I had zero confidence, I didn’t do well, I was in trouble a lot.” Her mother, who works in child development, told her: “You’re not sitting here, wasting your life”, and so Clark applied to the National Youth Theatre of Wales, the National Youth Theatre of Great Britain and Welsh National Youth Opera. She got in to all three. “It was totally life-changing. Not just being on stage, but spending time with adults who didn’t just tell me off.” After attending the National Youth Theatre of Wales, she studied at Drama Centre London – a wrench to leave her beloved Cardiff, but now very much home. In 2017, she will be seen in Interlude in Prague, a film about Mozart, and is currently auditioning for plays. She says: “I’ve done two Shakespeare tragedies, so I’d desperately like to do comedy. It would be nice not to die.” Three more to watch ■ Though not long graduated from Rada, Tamara Lawrance has been busy: after Unreachable at the Royal Court and Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom at the National, in February she returns to the NT to play Viola in Twelfth Night to Tamsin Greig’s Malvolia. ■ Women’s Hour put Sh!t Theatre’s Louise Mothersole and Rebecca Biscuit on the radar with their lively take on modern feminism, while their show Letters to Windsor House, a sideways look at the housing crisis, was a big hit at Edinburgh. ■ Alexander Zeldin’s play about zero-hours contracts, Beyond Caring, proved potently timely at the Yard theatre in 2014.

A call-centre worker with a high-pitched screech croons velvety Adele songs in between calls. Talk show host Windy Le Fontaine L’Doeuf dispenses dubious life advice and recipes for increasingly improbable dishes, not least of which is her “big pot of glams”. This sequence of surreal characters is vividly brought to life by 26-year-old south Londoner Lolly Adefope, whose own persona occasionally makes an onstage appearance to undercut the jokes with equally funny barbed asides. The fourth wall is also broken to incorporate viewers in unwinnable game shows. It’s a thrilling experience, often playing on audience awkwardness about race and the fear of living in an echo chamber. Inspired by an early love for Brass Eye and The Day Today, and more recently US shows like Atlanta and Insecure,Adefope developed a taste for bizarre but topical humour. After an English degree at Loughborough university followed by an unfulfilling job (“it was so boring you’re going to regret asking”), she started doing open mic nights and getting small roles on TV shows. In her Edinburgh debut, 2015’s double Chortle award-nominated and Jon Ronson-endorsed Lolly, she impersonated various characters who were part of a talent show. Critics praised her performance but a number of reviews remarked on the fact that she hardly referenced her race, with some suggesting she should talk about it more. “I feel like a white comedian won’t get told ‘oh you never mentioned your race,’” she says when we meet in a crowded central London cafe. “But that’s not what the show was about.” Its follow-up, Lolly2, was written partly in response to these reviews – some of which are quoted on a screen – and race is a central theme (in one memorable scene, an aspiring actor auditions for the role of “Black Hermione”). At the end there’s a standing ovation from the (mostly white) crowd. Using characters gives Adefope a way of expressing anger and addressing politically charged subjects such as Brexit and #OscarsSoWhite at one step removed. “If I was doing standup I would worry that someone would think I was being preachy, whereas, with a character, it always tends to be the opposite of what I think. You can get away with things.” But none of the more serious points would be effective if the characters didn’t work. Adefope steps from one persona to the next with ease, adopting finely tuned mannerisms, pitch-perfect accents, and a lot of sheer silliness. Between her standup, acting and increasingly frequent TV appearances, we can expect to see a lot more of her. “Comedy is changing,” she says. “The appetite for more diverse stories is getting bigger. After my gig last week some people came up to me and said it was great to see themselves reflected. It was so nice because that’s exactly what I feel like.” Lolly2 is at the Soho theatre, London, on 16 January&nbsp; Three more to watch ■ Bilal Zafar’s satirical material about prejudice and Jaffa cakes, in which he takes on Islamophobic Twitter trolls, earned him a nomination for best newcomer at Edinburgh last year. ■ Also nominated was Jayde Adams for her Edinburgh debut, 31.

Accompanying her to hospital, he watched as doctors diagnosed malaria and prescribing various treatments accordingly. Only as she lay dying did they realise their initial diagnosis was wrong. It was pneumonia that was killing her. Turyabagye, 24, was so shocked by the circumstances surrounding the death that he began researching methodologies for diagnosing pneumonia and its treatments. To his surprise, he discovered that the illness affects far more children than it does adults. According to Unicef, pneumonia kills half a million children under five in sub-Saharan Africa every year, with the region accounting for half of all global deaths from pneumonia of children under five. “Many of those deaths are because of misdiagnosis,” says Turyabagye. “In the villages and remote areas, children get sick – and the first reaction is to treat them for malaria. Most people are aware of malaria, and the signs for malaria and pneumonia are very similar, so it is difficult for health professionals to differentiate.” Even when a correct diagnosis is made, treatment is often unavailable. According to the Uganda Paediatrics Association, fewer than 20% of children with pneumonia receive antibiotics, which cost less than $1 (81p). So Turyabagye began designing a biomedical smart jacket that would distinguish pneumonia’s symptoms – temperature, breathing rate and sound of the lungs – and eliminate most human error, diagnosing pneumonia at a rate three to four times faster than a doctor. He named it “Mamaope”, or “mother’s hope” – a reference to the 27,000 children who die of pneumonia in Uganda every year. “We focused on the distinguishing signs of pneumonia,” says Turyabagye. “One of the processes that most doctors use is a stethoscope to the check the lungs. But [pneumonia] tends to be on side points around the body, not just in the chest or back. Its accuracy of being able to diagnose what is healthy, and what is not, is very encouraging.” Currently a prototype, the Mamaope jacket will undergo an official national medical examination in January. Certification for use in health centres and hospitals is expected by spring. The jacket could be a major boon to diagnosing, treating and preventing pneumonia in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite international progress tackling measles, HIV and Aids and tetanus, funding towards eradicating pneumonia remains extremely low: for every dollar spent on global health in 2011, Unicef says, only two cents went to pneumonia. “Although sub-Saharan Africa accounts for half of pneumonia deaths among children under five worldwide, funding for pneumonia prevention, management and treatment in the region remains low,” according to Mark Young, senior health specialist for Unicef. “More resources and more commitment at the highest level will bring us closer to stopping this disease from being a major child killer.” The Mamaope jacket was shortlisted for this year’s £25,000 Africa prize for engineering innovation, and Turyabagye hopes this could jumpstart mass production of the jacket for use across the continent. “Really, we are looking to help the next generation,” he says. “Pneumonia has such a high rate in Uganda and our neighbouring countries, if we were able to distribute in those countries we could save a lot of people.”','https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jan/01/medical-smart-jacket-tackles-misdiagnosis-of-pneumonia','Medical smart jacket tackles misdiagnosis of pneumonia',110,'global-development'),('business/2017/jan/01/observer-business-review-of-the-year','When you start the year as a FTSE 100 company, but end it in second place on the list of the “modern Christmas cracker jokes” (according to UKTV’s comedy channel Gold) you can assume it’s been a challenging year. The company in question is, of course, Sports Direct, which spent 2016 engulfed by a crisis over pay and working conditions at its depot in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, where it was revealed that workers were effectively receiving less than the national minimum wage after unpaid body searches and tough financial penalties for slight lateness. Hence the chart-topping gag: what do workers at Sports Direct get for Christmas dinner? Answer: about five minutes. But was that really the funniest Sports Direct crack of the year? Maybe not. There was the one where founder Mike Ashley went through a mock security check as part of a PR campaign to demonstrate he really was a man of the people, only to then pull a wad of £50 notes out of his pocket; a similar joke about the company buying a private jet, but allowing staff to rent it for a commercial rate; plus another one when MPs visited Shirebrook only to discover they were being secretly recorded. Still, the most hilarious joke was surely delivered by chairman Keith Hellawell in September, when he refused to resign. A great year for fiction … in British politics The Man Booker prize for fiction went to Paul Beatty in 2016 for The Sellout – and no doubt it was well deserved too. But it was scandalous what names were missed off the shortlist. Somehow the judges overlooked the claims of the Leave campaign in June’s referendum for “We send the EU £350m a week: let’s fund our NHS instead” as well as its rivals in the Remain camp for all sorts of far-fetched plots in its entry, Project Fear. Pages from that tome included IMF boss Christine Lagarde’s “We have done our homework and we haven’t found anything positive to say about a Brexit vote”; JP Morgan chief Jamie Dimon’s warning he could cut 4,000 UK jobs if Britain voted to leave the EU; plus, of course, then chancellor George Osborne’s warning that he’d have to slash public spending and increase taxes in an emergency budget to tackle a £30bn “black hole”. We did vote to leave, of course, and FTSE quickly crashed, making all of the above look quite smart. The FTSE then rose above where it was before and never got that low again – while economic data stubbornly refused to fit in with the Remainers’ expectations. They currently look less smart. Shy and retiring Green heads for a big bash It is now eight months since BHS collapsed and six months since its former owner Sir Philip Green promised to “sort” the £571m pension deficit. BHS is still bust while Green is still working on a solution (and shouting at people). That is despite a year in which the constantly cross shopkeeper has been battling it out with his old pal Mike Ashley for the Fred Goodwin Silver Salver, which this page likes to award to Britain’s most despised business person. Green’s reputation plummeted in 2016 after BHS failed just a year after he had sold the business to the astonishingly unsuitable Dominic Chappell for £1. Both men were then hauled in front of a joint select committee to explain themselves, an exercise that only succeeded in trashing their reputations some more. The MPs found that the department store had been subjected to “systematic plunder” by former owners, while Green gave “insufficient priority” to the pension scheme. Still, let’s look on the bright side. Green is partial to having a small birthday party every five years (you know the sort of thing: music by Stevie Wonder, topless modelling by Simon Cowell) and his 2017 birthday is a significant one. In March, the retailing knight turns 65, at which point he’ll be able to draw his state, er, pension. So, Vladimir, where do you keep your savings? April saw the release of the Panama Papers, an unprecedented leak of 11.5&nbsp;million files from the database of the world’s fourth biggest offshore law firm, Mossack Fonseca. The records were obtained from an anonymous source by the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). The ICIJ then shared them with a large network of international partners, including the Guardian, Observer and the BBC. Perhaps the most startling tale to emerge was the network of secret offshore deals and vast loans worth $2bn laying a trail to Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin. The president’s name did not appear in any of the records, but his friends earned millions from deals that seemingly could not have been secured without his patronage, while the documents suggested Putin’s family benefited from this money. The leak also showed a Panama-based offshore trust set up by David Cameron’s late father had benefited the then prime minister. He ended up making a complete hash of his response by stalling for three days, with four partial statements issued by Downing Street, before confessing he owned shares in the tax haven fund, which he sold for £31,500 just before becoming PM in 2010. Putin’s year improved. Cameron’s didn’t. Gears start to grind in the gig economy Not a great year if you run a business in the so-called gig economy, as a number of moves threatened to improve the lot of workers at firms from Hermes to Deliveroo to Uber – and, possibly, undermine their business models. The UK’s chief taxman referred Hermes to HMRC compliance officers following complaints by couriers that they were being paid at levels equivalent to below the “national living wage”. The move came after newspaper reports revealed that some self-employed couriers for the company, which delivers for retailers including John Lewis and Next, were taking home less than the legal minimum. Some 78 couriers subsequently made complaints to Frank Field, the chairman of the Commons work and pensions select committee. Meanwhile, Deliveroo was told in August that it must pay its workers the minimum wage unless a court rules that they are self-employed, while in November delivery firm CitySprint became embroiled in a similar dispute over the gig economy, when it faced demands to treat its freelance couriers as workers. That came a month after a tribunal ruled that Uber drivers were not self-employed and should be paid the national living wage, in a landmark case which could affect tens of thousands of workers in the gig economy. Uber immediately said it would appeal. The long and the short of it, courtesy of Sky “If there is one issue I regard as crucial to successful investment, it is the need for a long-term approach ... Many people in the financial services industry now acknowledge the need for a seismic shift to long-termism, though sometimes this looks like lip service.” That was Martin Gilbert, boss of Aberdeen Asset Management, in a blogpost in 2015. And it is also the same Gilbert who, wearing another hat as deputy chairman of Sky, sought instant gratification by waving through the idea that Rupert Murdoch’s £10.75-a-share bid for the TV group was fair – a conclusion he and his committee came to “after a period of negotiation” that lasted about 48 hours. Anyway, through 21st Century Fox Murdoch formally lodged an £11.7bn bid in December to take control of the two-thirds of Sky he doesn’t already own, meaning he will now need to gain regulatory approval for the deal, which values Sky at more than £18bn. If it goes through, he would control Sky’s operations in the UK, Germany and Italy in addition to his ownership of the Times, Sunday Times and Sun, and the radio group TalkSport. Still, some shareholders and analysts accuse Sky of selling on the cheap, pointing out that the shares were at the offer level as recently as February. How Glasenberg dug himself out of a hole Considering he has made a habit of topping “not-so-rich” lists since floating Glencore in 2011, 2016 was a stellar year for the commodity trader’s second-largest shareholder and chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg. The shares have soared by about 200%, taking the value of his holding to more than £3bn and alleviating the crisis that reduced Glasenberg to his last billion. That turnaround was achieved by hauling Glencore out of its debt hole. Borrowings have been reduced from $30bn to $17.5bn by selling $6bn of assets, cutting expenditure and raising $2.5bn of fresh capital at 125p a share. Glasenberg himself had to write a $211m cheque during that cash call (which is rather impressive) but that punt has paid off handsomely and dividends are set to resume next year. Still, let’s not be too charitable. For all the successes of 2016, it merely reversed some of the pain of previous years. Glasenberg’s aggressive use of debt created the crisis for the company and the shares are still only worth about half of what they were when they listed at 530p, almost six years ago. Something like 2016’s performance is required in 2017, therefore. Leicester won – but the bookies didn’t lose When Leicester City won the Premier League in May – having started the season as a 5,000-1 shot – all the quoted bookmakers started whining that they had paid out £25m, which was dubbed “the biggest loss in British history on a single sporting market”. What a load of old nonsense that was. What really happened was the bookies coined it in all season on the back of unbelievably freakish results, only to hand a fraction of that back at the death. Even so, as this page never tires of pointing out, the myth of the bookies being fleeced by Leicester’s triumph comes second only to the even more unbelievable line that the Foxes’ triumph was football’s “greatest fairytale”. No: it was only the third-greatest footballing fairytale in the East Midlands in the past 44 years.','https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/01/observer-business-review-of-the-year','Observer business agenda’s review of the year',111,'business'),('politics/2017/jan/01/rising-stars-2017-campaigner-faiza-shaheen-centre-labour-social-studies','Dr Faiza Shaheen is an economist, writer, activist and director of the Centre for Labour and Social Studies (Class), described by her as “a thinktank with a twist”. Founded four years ago, its remit, she says, is “to disrupt and challenge mainstream thinking” while staying out of the current Corbyn/Brexit pro or anti quagmire. “I took a friend into a bookshop recently and said, ‘Look at the books on economics – almost all are written by white men from a similar income group. The books on gender are all written by women, the books on race by people of colour.’ I’m really keen that both myself and Class break out of these intellectual ghettos, that we work on issues that change the situation, that turn off the tap, not just mop up the mess. Five years from now, I want Class to be the leading voice on how we shape a different kind of society.” Shaheen, 34, was born in Leytonstone, east London, and attended the same school as David Beckham. “Only a third [of pupils] got five GCSEs A* to C. You only had to do your homework to stand out but we had a real camaraderie,” she says. “Oxford wasn’t like that at all. Everyone was in competition. I looked at the stats recently and there are still only a handful of people of colour in each year, just as when I was there. That’s shocking. It’s always the same pool of people ruling the world in politics and business. That has to change. “Oxford politicised me because I was always being called to account. ‘Why do Muslims have a chip on their shoulder, Faiza?’ I became known as the rude girl with attitude, which is hilarious because my friends in London said they liked me precisely because that’s what I wasn’t. “I realised very young that nobody was going to open any doors for me. If you’re going to fight for justice you have to have weapons and I decided that education, economics and statistics were going to be mine.” Shaheen’s father is from Fiji, her mother is Pakistani. “A concern about inequality and justice has always been a part of me. Whether it was the result of being called Paki in the playground or because while we were considered poor by British standards, when we visited family in Karachi we were seen as insanely rich.” Ten years ago, when Shaheen began a PhD, her mother became ill. Two months ago, she had a successful heart transplant. “I thought it was amazing that someone gave her their heart. They didn’t ask if she was Pakistani. In the intensive care waiting room everyone looked out for each other regardless of race and class. It reminded me that there is a huge amount of humanity in spite of the horrible political time we’ve had.” Three more to watch ■ Among a number of other admirable roles, Josh Babarinde is CEO and founder of Cracked It, a social enterprise that trains at-risk young people to fix cracked iPhones, as a route away from gang crime. ■ Working on a PhD on domestic violence, Sarah Kwei is one of the founders of Sisters Uncut, using direct action to fight cuts to refuges and domestic violence&nbsp;services.

A very serious-looking man with a laptop a couple of tables down keeps eye-rolling in her direction and it’s throwing her off her game. To be fair to him, a quiet cafe isn’t Kloe’s natural environment: her sweary outbursts mix loudly with the sort of unvarnished opinions pop stars aren’t meant to give these&nbsp;days. Asked if she’s annoyed that the nuanced pop of her debut EP Teenage Craze, or the fizzing follow-up singles UDSM and Liability, failed to earn her a spot on the BBC Sound of 2017 longlist, she gives the kind of answer her label Columbia might not want for the press release. “I couldn’t give two fucks, honestly,” she says, a mischievous grin on her face. “I’m not going to rush my music out to get on a fucking poll and wank off Radio 1 for a bit.” Bored senseless by school (“I didn’t like being patronised”), Kloe studied her musical heroes, mixing an early love for Taylor Swift with her dad’s recommendations of Joni Mitchell and Bowie. “I’d sit with all their lyrics and chords and just study them. I think songwriting is so fascinating.” An early acoustic singer-songwriter phase led to a Britain’s Got Talent audition at the age of 13 (thankfully, she didn’t get through), while a YouTube channel still exists of her covering her favourite band, the 1975. Keen to keep her musical exploits secret “at one of the worst schools in Glasgow”, she took on dual roles: “I was like Clydebank’s Hannah Montana – on the weekends I’d drink cider in the park with all the cool kids and then in the week I’d lock myself in the music rooms and write songs.” As she got older, her musical tastes evolved, taking in intelligent, emotion-led pop music by the likes of Charli XCX and Lorde; the latter she credits with “changing the game and making a new lane for people like me”. In 2015, she landed a record deal and her 2016 debut EP was given a huge lift after the delicate Grip, inspired by a drunken fumble with a band’s frontman at a festival, was played by Zane Lowe. As with all Kloe’s songs, Grip’s magnetism comes from its lyrical honesty. “You know you get revenge porn? Well, I do revenge songs,” she says, before outlining a self-imposed ban on writing any more songs about boys. With her debut album currently taking shape between London and LA, Kloe is pragmatic about her current position in the pop cosmos. Well, sort of. “I am Beyoncé in my own head – I’ve won five Grammys, I’ve toured the world, played arenas – but no one knows who the fuck I am yet,” she cackles. That’s categorically about to change.

That was in 1983, before they became clients of Brian Eno – and, arguably, the last time anyone had any peace on the first day of the year. New Year’s Eve raves routinely spill over into the next evening. The ceaseless chirrup of social media precludes silence. Into this clamour lands Reflection, the latest ambient work by Eno, the Roxy Music maverick who named this new genre in 1978 with Music For Airports, and whose cultural reach now spans the avant garde, Coldplay albums and generative apps.&nbsp;If your idea of an album is 12 or so&nbsp;tunes, Eno routinely bucks that set of&nbsp;strictures, even if his last album, The Ship – released last April – cleaved closer than most to tradition. Here, the one track unfurls very gradually over 54 minutes (and one second), its thrums and oscillations reverberating at a pace you might call glacial if the glaciers weren’t all melting in such a hurry. At seven minutes in, the tones gather momentum. At 21 minutes, there’s something like the twitter of an electronic bird. It gets going again at the 47-minute mark, when the bell-like nuances once again turn up a notch. The overall effect is deeply, magnificently peaceful, meditative, even; ambient certainly monopolises certain sections of the thesaurus. Naysayers may liken ambient music to watching paint dry, but this is paint drying on a Mark Rothko canvas. The&nbsp;harder you tune in, the more there&nbsp;is to notice, the more you let it wash over you, the more it sucks you in to reveal internal structures. Throughout his long career, Eno has tinkered with gear and software that allows for the autonomous generation of sounds. As well as the standard version, Reflection also comes in “premium generative” editions. Core elements and sets of parameters fed in by Eno can be randomly recombined ad infinitum by a set of algorithms – a considerably gussied-up version of a Buddha machine, if you like. Reflection also – inevitably – throws up a set of reflections. The idea of authorship is a vexed question at the best of times, what with the death of the author, and the collaborative nature of vast amounts of art and cultural products. Pop routinely comes under fire for being written “by committee”. But if an algorithm composed this music, is Brian Eno the author of it? Geeks have long thrilled to the idea of computer-generated music; in Japan, they already have a virtual pop star called Hatsune Miku. Music analysis software exists that can predict hits with increasing accuracy, and Google Labs have an ersatz neural network up and running that can make convincing music. Along with all the other careers currently being destroyed by automation, it looks like that most notionally human of all – music – is under threat. If you’re feeling paranoid as 2017 begins, the vast rippling peace of this album can suddenly take on a slightly sinister bent.','https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/01/brian-eno-reflection-album-review-ambient-generative','Brian Eno: Reflection review – soothing, but sobering',114,'music'),('culture/2017/jan/01/martin-freeman-sherlock-interview-ricky-gervais','Hampshire-born actor Martin Freeman, 45, found fame as long-suffering sales rep Tim in The Office. He went on to play hero Bilbo Baggins in The Hobbit trilogy, with other film credits including Love Actually and The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy. He was Emmy-nominated for the Fargo TV series and won a Bafta for his role as Dr John Watson in Sherlock, the BBC’s contemporary reboot of Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes detective stories, alongside Benedict Cumberbatch’s high-functioning sleuth. Freeman has two children with actor Amanda Abbington, who plays Watson’s wife, Mary, in Sherlock. It’s exactly a year since the last episode of Sherlock. Where are the characters as we rejoin them? Well, John and Mary have a baby. A little daughter called Rosamund. That’s the big change in their lives but you can’t change the dynamic of the show too much, so Watson is soon back on the mystery trail with Sherlock. The fabric of the series, after all, is the adventures of two weird blokes in London. Co-creator Steven Moffat says Sherlock is “less of a dick” this series. Is he? Yeah, hanging out with his best mate for a few years has had a slightly softening, humanising effect on Sherlock. If he hadn’t picked up on some social clues from John Watson, he’d be an idiot, not a genius. Although, of course, his abrasive side does still come out. You wouldn’t want an episode of Sherlock where he didn’t say something cutting and emotionally clueless. The last series climaxed with arch villain Moriarty seemingly taunting Sherlock from beyond the grave. Is he back? Moriarty is dead but it’s safe to say he may still play a part in our futures. There have been rumours of a shock twist where… Why even finish that sentence? I already have a red laser dot on my forehead as you’re asking. The BBC equivalent of Moriarty is about to snuff me out. Honestly, it will be a delight for you to wait and see. Watson is always stylishly dressed. Do you have input there? I have strong opinions but Sarah Arthur, the costume designer, is brilliant. We’re of accord and we’ve sorted out John’s aesthetic. It’s traditional English style that’s a bit medical, a bit military – a nod to his professions – but he’s also got to be ready for action. There’s always a dapper little detail – a bit of corduroy or tweed… Absolutely. There’s no reason why Watson shouldn’t care about what he wears. There is a bit of overlap with my own clothes but in my defence, I don’t just pick things that I fancy nicking at the end of the series. What’s going on with Watson’s hair this series? It looks longer, possibly greyer… He’s just got different hair. Over the course of seven years, people do change their hairstyle. It’s a bit of a new birth for him too. He’s a dad now and it signifies change. So it’s dad hair? I don’t know what sort of dads you’re knocking about with, who look that good. Watson spends much of his time wearing a papoose… Indeed, as dads do nowadays. It’s been a good few years since I’ve worn one [Freeman’s own children are 10 and eight] and you forget what it’s like. It was all a trip down memory lane: the dash to the hospital, the sleepless nights, the fear and panic of becoming a parent. Not to mention inadvertently leaving the house with sick on my shoulder. WC Fields’s adage was, “Never work with animals or children”. How come there are both in the opening episode? As we were filming, we were asking Mark [Gatiss, co-creator and writer of the opening episode] what the hell he was thinking. It’s page one of the showbiz manual but he put both in. To be fair, the bloodhound was much more badly behaved than the babies. Watson’s wife, Mary, is played by your partner, Amanda Abbington. Does that make scenes easier or harder? Erm, well, Amanda and I aren’t together in real life any more. I don’t know if you knew that. No. I’m sorry. It’s all right, it’s fine. It’s been most of the year, actually. So we did this series not being together, which was kind of odd, although we were doing it as friends and we’re still very close. It’s always interesting doing stuff with your partner because you know each other better than anybody else and that was obviously still the case with this series. But it wasn’t lost on me and Amanda that, “Oh look, we’re holding our fictional baby. Remember this?” Statues of Margaret Thatcher get smashed in episode one. Are you prepared for accusations of BBC lefty luvvieness? Weirdly enough, it never occurred to me that smashing busts of Thatcher might be considered a little dig. Maybe we should have smashed a bust of Tony Blair just to even it up. Toby Jones guest stars in this series and looks like he’s going to be great… That’s where you’re wrong, he’s awful. No, Toby plays a great character and does a grand job. He’s a very unctuous, oily, truly horrific villain who the audience will enjoy despising. Would you say this is the darkest series yet? I would. There have always been grisly deaths and emotional turmoil in Sherlock. But pound for pound, yes, there’s a little bit more dark grey, if not black. Sherlock is a global hit with a devoted fanbase. What’s that like? You could live three lifetimes and not hope to repeat this sort of success, so you can’t be churlish about it. You have to take it as a huge compliment. What sort of gifts do fans send you? Things they’ve clearly put a lot of thought and effort into. We get sent a lot of dolls. Knitted figures with, frankly, very good crochet work. A lot of intricate craft pieces, artwork, paintings. People really take time, which is lovely. Were you ever a fan of anything to that degree? No, I never crocheted anyone. If only I had the skills. I did write to the Style Council when they broke up, saying thanks and I really appreciate what you’ve done, but I don’t think I ever posted the letter. When will we get more Sherlock? In all honesty, without being cagey, I have no idea. We take our time between series for various reasons, quality control not the least of them. So when the time’s right, we’ll do it. I’ve seen it. There’s a shark in it. (Laughs) Which is always good. Let’s just hope we haven’t jumped it. Did you see David Walliams and Jack Whitehall’s Sherlock spoof on sketch show Walliams &amp; Friend? Yes, it was quite funny. I applaud Jack, he gave it a good go. At least he’s a similar physical type to Benedict: tall, good-looking and mysterious. But David just played me like he plays a lot of people – as a camp idiot. Or maybe that’s what I am and don’t realise. But I love David and Jack, they can carry on as far as I’m concerned. Did you also see the David Brent film, Life on the Road, this summer? I did and really liked it. Ricky [Gervais] was careful not to make it a sequel to The Office, so the idea of me returning as Tim was never floated at all. Purely as a viewer, I love the Brent character and Ricky’s amazing at it. He will always make me laugh doing Brent. Do you know Love Actually was recently voted the nation’s favourite Christmas film? I did not. That’s nice. I like that film. The writing is absolutely beautiful. Some of Richard Curtis’s best, I think. You’re all over our TVs at Christmas, aren’t you? Love Actually, The Office Christmas Special, Stick Man… And Nativity [2009 film comedy], that’s a good one. You’re Mr Christmas. A modern-day Bing Crosby or Val Doonican. The new Noel Edmonds. Please God. You’re an inflammatory fucker. Finally, any New Year resolutions? I say this every year: to try and be a slightly better person than I was the year before. One day, I’ll get there.

Her first novel was 2012’s The Spider King’s Daughter, which she began writing aged 17. Her follow-up is the powerful Welcome to Lagos. How did it feel having your first novel published aged 21? There’s an Igbo proverb: “Whenever a person wakes up is his own morning.” It was a brilliant, miraculous experience – but also really overwhelming​, which meant m​y second book​, Welcome to Lagos, was difficult to write. In my first novel there are only two main characters ​but ​this time I decided I wanted to write an ensemble novel but didn’t know how, so I went through lots of drafts trying out viewpoints – I think the beauty of it is working it out yourself. What was the inspiration behind your second novel? I was going to write a novel about a teenager moving to England, which would have been incredibly autobiographical because I moved to England aged 14 – but I wouldn’t have been able to write it with detachment and humour. I do want to write about that one day. Then I had a dream about two soldiers. The impetus, the seed of the idea was that dream. I’d also just read Amitav Ghosh’s Sea of Poppies and I really liked the ensemble cast. In the acknowledgments you thank “Lagos, city of my birth, my dreams, my frustrations, my imagination”… I started writing in primary school but Lagos wasn’t a place where I set my fiction until I moved to England. When I went to Lagos to visit I began to question things and not just passively move through the city. I began to wonder a lot more. In Americanah [by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie] there’s this idea that life is happening outside and then you get into the great outside and realise that life was happening in Lagos. I really love Lagos. At the same time, it is not a place you can romanticise – even from afar. Tell me about your research process... What happens in the book is a version of a real event – the Odi massacre​ in 1999​. Interviews were very important to get the range of perspectives, from a woman who works for a charity with former militants in the Niger Delta to someone who’d interacted with politicians. I visit Lagos a lot – my parents and brother live there. I refresh my sense of Lagos as often as possible. You powerfully explore faith in this novel… Christianity is a big part of my life. One of my favourite CS Lewis books is Surprised By Joy. In my first year of university I was exploring and questioning my faith, and I wanted to capture that rumination in this novel. Faith isn’t often explored in literary fiction from the inside although Marilynne Robinson’s Home and Gilead are brilliant. How did you become interested in the theme of social divides? I knew from a young age about injustice and was aware of that aspect of Nigeria. There’s a baseline of opportunity that is not there for so many people. We went to a church where we had friends from across the social spectrum and we would go to each other’s houses and see that not everyone lived as ​we did. When we go back to the village where my father is from, I can see where he springs from – the roads are still not tarred, there isn’t good access to healthcare and running water. They started off in a hut and that hut is still in the family compound – so there’s no need for any airs and graces. Tell me about your literary influences. My dad was the oral storyteller and my mum bought us the books she read as a child, as she had a very colonial education – David Copperfield and Rebecca and Little Women. During the school lunch break, I felt transported to 19th-century England. I really feel that the Paris Review was like my creative writing master. It gave so much good advice – some of my favourites are Toni Morrison’s and John Steinbeck’s interviews. I went through a phase where I would read one interview a day. I felt mentored by all these writers. Are you still a voracious reader? Yes. I’ve just started The Goldfinch​ by Donna Tartt. Libraries are so miraculous. It’s really sad that they’re closing libraries; it’s cutting off people’s opportunities. I know what it is to come from a culture where books are a luxury. In the library I was a member of in Nigeria you could only borrow one book at a time. Here, I discovered you could borrow 10 books at a time – riches! Wealth beyond measure! Books are expensive in Nigeria. So reading is an expensive habit. I became aware at an early age of the power of books. • Welcome to Lagos by Chibundu Onuzo is published by Faber (£12.99).

It still staggers me, their story. Quite how one chilly Yorkshire parsonage bred three sisters who would upend the world of books remains a transformative tale. Lynne Reid Banks, in her book Dark Quartet, told it ridiculously well, but in Wainwright’s version, To Walk Invisible, we get to see the cold red knees, the chilblains, the anger, the sorrow; we get to feel every icy gust of bitterness, every rare zephyr of hope. The sorrow is reserved mainly, of course, for brother Branwell, historically branded the reprobate boozer-loser flop of the clan. Adam Nagaitis bravely played him as a whey ugly nightmare with a ginger rat’s-nest of hair and whiskers: he played him, in fact, like a man with a constant pendulous drip at the end of his nose, waiting throughout to plop. If Branwell has been miserably served by history, it’s quite possibly justified: his antics, his debts, even his death, held his vaultingly more talented sisters in cruel thrall for most of their too-short lives. Chloe Pirrie as Emily bestrode the moors with seven-league boots and dominated every frame with her presence, her anger, her tenderness, as she did in the bittersweet 2013 movie Shell. Finn Atkins was Charlotte, all of a fiercely bespectacled five-foot-nought even in her Holly-Hobbie boots, but arguably the righteous steel and brains behind the outfit. The scenes at the London publishers, where she reluctantly reveals herself as Currer Bell, author of Jane Eyre, retain the ability to make one simultaneously laugh, cry and want to punch most men in the face. Wisely, Wainwright doesn’t follow every single publication success. In lesser hands, we would have had obligatory acceptance letters for each sister – for Wuthering Heights, for Agnes Grey – to the backdrop of father Jonathan Pryce being all a-dither and Branwell spewing up drunken blood next door. Instead, and better, it is left to Charlotte to tremulously inform the father of the sisters’ financial independence, and reveal their noms de plume, by carrying through a few handsome bound volumes currently lionising literary London. Few of us surely get to see such quiet, shocked, heartbreaking pride in a father’s face. It’s a tale that cannot be told often enough, and the utter standout in a week not devoid of sharp writing and acting. Sarah Phelps managed the near-impossible, to have me nurture a flicker of interest in Agatha Christie again. Her adaptation of The Witness for the Prosecution made me grimace for all the lost chances, those dire Ustinov-heavy glitterball farts of the 1970s, and remember that Christie, for all her absurd toxic frog intricacies and devilled snobberies, remains one of the tautest plotters ever. It was a dark and a nasty story, utterly watchable throughout if you could train your eyes to attain at least a modicum of movement inside one of the many fogs – but train them you should, not least for the quality of the acting. Andrea Riseborough, Kim Cattrall, David Haig – all sprinkled enigmatic magics. But Toby Jones’s final act had all the sublime bathos of the last 10 minutes of Death in Venice, and without Mahler’s help. Give that man a sainthood. Delicious, a much-hyped Sky thing, had that grand Iain Glen, and that grand Emilia Fox, and Dawn French. Two were well cast. Ostensibly a tale about a successful chef who’s having it all in gorgeous Cornish countryside and ruining it all with his penis, it was hampered somewhat by having Glen die at the end of the first episode, jumped from behind by his own cardiovascular system. Which sets the stage for a bonding between wife (Fox) and mistress (French, Glen’s ex-wife) to bravely reconcile each other to the tasks of a) forgiving each other, and b)&nbsp;making an even more glowing success of the restaurant. Those harsh first-world problems. Fortunately they are aided by a couple of children who promise great interest, and it’s perfectly filmed, and features lovely food and sea and sun. I’ll forgive Fox anything pretty much, because of Silent Witness, but here she displays little of that coquetry, which is a shame. I should be able to forgive Dawn French more easily, but can’t, because of The Vicar of Dibley, and because I find her credibility stretched as a louche Italian genius chef. Louche Italian genius female chefs, I’ll tentatively warrant, don’t keep the duvet chin-high when in the throes of&nbsp;passion. I wanted to like Maigret’s Dead Man, wanted very much so to do, if only because it was ITV’s one swipe at the Christmas piñata. It was fine. Plot was fine, Rowan straight-batted it glumly fine, France of old looked, as it ever will, yearningly sexy. Essentially, however, it was, as it was always destined to be, a 40-minute Simenon delight crammed into two hours. I decided not to lazily write off Mrs Brown’s Boys. It remains absurdly successful, despite critics having generally trashed Brendan O’Carroll’s creation as demeaning, cheap, grotesque, simplistic to the point of catalepsy, savagely lacking in wit. So I watched it, and was surprised. It’s all of these insults, yes, but the immersive experience is actually, shockingly, worse than expected. Sentimental to retching-point, homophobic, itch-lousy with single entendres, somehow managing to be both twee and vulgar, achingly unfunny, it made The Vicar of Dibley look like Father Ted. I suspect those of us in our high ivory metropolitan-elite towers (translation: humans who paid even nugatory attention to at least one class in school) missed a trick in 2016: the popularity of this shameless excrescence (I can now write it off after due diligence), which was voted by Radio Times readers the best sitcom of the 21st century, should have given a huge clue to the Brexit vote.','https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/01/to-walk-invisible-the-witness-for-the-prosecution-review','The week in TV: To Walk Invisible; The Witness for the Prosecution; Delicious; Maigret’s Dead Man; Mrs Brown’s Boys – review',117,'tv-and-radio'),('lifeandstyle/2017/jan/01/rising-stars-2017-chef-lope-ariyo-nigerian-food-jollof-rice','“I’ve never been much of a traditionalist,” says Lopè Ariyo. “Whenever my mum and grandma see me doing stuff, they’re like, ‘O-kaaay’.” She mimics a Nigerian woman looking askance at jollof rice made with grated cauliflower instead of actual rice, or fish and chips with cassava batter and spicy yams for chips. “It’s only once they’ve tasted it that they say, ‘OK, I see what you’re doing.’ Now my mum gets a bit upset when I don’t cook for her.” As well she might. Last September, her daughter, who is 24, went from being an undergraduate with a food blog on the side, to an author whose first book, Hibiscus, out in June, may change the way we see African food in&nbsp;Britain. Ariyo was in her final year of a maths degree at Loughborough when she heard about a competition to find a cook who would “break an African cuisine into the home kitchens of the UK”. The competition, conceived by Red magazine and HarperCollins, was responding to a lack of diversity in British cookery writing. With encouragement from friends, Ariyo sent in an application, which she rushed home from her final exam to complete, and was called in a week later to cook alongside four other finalists representing North, East, South and Central Africa. Her freewheeling, boldly flavourful take on Nigerian cuisine won out and landed her a book deal with HarperCollins. “My cooking is a union of English and Nigerian,” Ariyo says when we meet near her family home in East Croydon. Like any born-and-bred south Londoner, she was exposed to a wide variety of flavours growing up: “We did eat Nigerian food at home but not on a daily basis.” It was when she went to boarding school in Lagos at the age of 11 that she got a proper taste for traditional dishes such as jollof rice, pounded yam and egusi soup. Returning to London two years later,&nbsp;she craved the food she’d left behind and set about recreating it at home – but in a liberal fashion, improvising with whatever was available and sneaking in ideas from other cuisines. Purists such as her&nbsp;Nigerian&nbsp;grandmother may raise&nbsp;an&nbsp;eyebrow (at least initially) but&nbsp;her British friends were unanimous&nbsp;in their approval. As were the competition judges. “She jumped out instantly,” says Pip McCormac, lifestyle director at Red. “Her recipes seemed really approachable – interesting and exciting but not beyond the realm of comprehension.” Having tasted her sticky-sweet hibiscus chicken and that jollof cauliflower rice, which is intense, satisfying – and healthy without seeming virtuous – I heartily agree. For all its richness and mindboggling variety, African food has yet to cross over in the UK. With her lively, accessible take on Nigerian cuisine, Lopè Ariyo could be the person to make it happen.

But his film-making debut, Lady Macbeth, out this spring, has nothing to do with the Bard. Featuring a mesmeric lead performance by Florence Pugh – the discovery of Carol Morley’s film The Falling – it’s the 19th-century story of Katherine, a young married woman in the north of England who frees herself from the shackles of patriarchy in the most drastic way. Written by playwright Alice Birch, it’s adapted from Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, an 1860s Russian novel by Nikolai Leskov, which also inspired an opera by Shostakovich. The book is almost forgotten today but Oldroyd says: “It’s a cracking read. We’re used to so much literature of that period where women either suffer in silence or run away. Katherine full-bloodedly takes her destiny in both hands. It’s in the Jacobean tragic tradition.” Despite being visibly exhausted from the film’s festival tour – he’s been on the circuit since it debuted in Toronto in September – Oldroyd, 37, comes across as more buoyant, and boyish, than you expect from his early publicity photos, in which he sported a solemn Old Testament beard. This former theology student originally planned to become a priest but lost his faith at university in Durham and discovered theatre instead. He got into directing by accident, when taking part in a revue in Edinburgh: “When you weren’t actually on stage, you were sitting back and telling your mates why they weren’t funny. That, I realised, was basically directing.” He went on to be an assistant at theatres including the Almeida and the Barbican, where he worked on Deborah Warner’s epic Julius Caesar; had a directing residency at the Young Vic; and has travelled the world staging Beckett in Germany, Sartre’s Kean in Japan, baroque opera in Portugal and Donizetti at Sadler’s Wells. Raised in Guildford, Oldroyd first tried his hand at film during a stint at art school, making video diaries on the short-lived Flip camera. But it took him a long time to evolve the rigorous style of Lady Macbeth. “The first short I made was a scene from a play. I shot it in a field from one angle, because that was where I was used to sitting in a theatre. I thought, why doesn’t this work?” He became a lot more confident on his 2013 short Best, a five-minute two-hander that won the Sundance London Short Film Competition. Now he is poised for his first US project, an adaptation of Walter Mosley’s novel The Man in My Basement. For the record, Oldroyd has done an actual Macbeth – a 2004 production starring Bertie Carvel. “We filled the Union theatre in Southwark with peat and a whole load of candles and fur.

Portuguese priests Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Garupe (Adam Driver) are “an army of two”, embarking upon a Conradian mission to “the ends of the Earth” where Christians are forced to renounce their faith on pain of torture and death. “We find our original nature in Japan,” declares Ferreira (Liam Neeson), a Jesuit missionary who has reportedly gone native, turning his back on the cross and living as a Japanese with wife and family to match. Yet the young padres, proud and impetuous, refuse to believe that their former mentor has abandoned their God, or that Christianity cannot take root in “this swamp” of Japan. “Christ is here,” insists Rodrigues, “I just can’t hear&nbsp;him.” Scorsese has been wrestling with Endō’s novel (first filmed by Masahiro Shinoda in 1971) for decades, and his labour of love has resulted in a film that is both loving and laborious. Like its subjects, Silence often stumbles as it strives to touch eternal truths, occasionally testing our patience. But it’s clearly Scorsese’s most personal work since Mean Streets, addressing issues of faith and doubt (alongside examinations of cultural and political monotheism) in a manner that has something of the quizzical passion of Dreyer and the earthy grit of Pasolini. Significantly, Scorsese’s films opens and closes to the sounds of nature, which, we are told, is too fundamental to Japanese culture to be usurped by alien Christianity. What little music there is remains as distant as the voice of God, drowned out by sotto voce conversations or the distant peal of a chapel bell. The visuals are painterly, with only a couple of energetic sweeps past the wooden slats of a prison cage reminding us of the frenzied urgency of Goodfellas or Casino. Instead, cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto conjures misty underworld vistas, Taiwan doubling handsomely for Japan in a series of arresting devotional tableaux. Even horrific scenes of Christians on poles being scalded with boiling water or drowned in a raging sea are shot with a peculiar serenity, the suffering somehow magnified by the placidity of the camera. In the lead roles, Garfield and Driver (respectively graduates of the Spider-Man and Star Wars franchises) bring mainstream appeal, although wobbly Portuguese accents threaten to undercut the solemnity of their English-language dialogue. With his angular features Driver catches the eye, but it is to Garfield’s leonine locks that Scorsese is drawn, the handsome face of Rodrigues evoking beatific images of Christ in whose likeness the padre presumes to style himself. No wonder he sees a vision of Jesus when gazing at his own reflection in a stream. As for Neeson, he played a Jesuit priest in The Mission, but his late-in-the-day reappearance here is more evocative of his turn as Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn in The Phantom Menace, reminding us that Kurosawa was always George Lucas’s guiding light. The real stars, however, are the Japanese cast, from Yōsuke Kubozuka’s enigmatic wretch, Kichijiro, who becomes Rodrigues’s own personal Judas, to Yoshi Oida’s devout elder Ichizo, to whose village these priests bring both salvation and suffering. As a smiling, silver-tongued interpreter, Tadanobu Asano is a superb foil to the inquisitor, Inoue, played with fly-swatting menace by a wheedling Issey Ogata. A scene in which Inoue appears to physically deflate is a masterclass in comedy acting, while his observations on “the persistent love of an ugly woman” are delivered in a manner that is amusing, insulting, and incisive in equal measure. “The weight of your silence is terrible,” Rodrigues whispers to God, and it’s a credit to Scorsese and co-writer Jay Cocks (his collaborator on The Age of Innocence and Gangs of New York) that this weight feels real and tangible. Silence may not possess the popular appeal of The Last Temptation of Christ or the breathtaking beauty of Kundun but it has the strength of its convictions, with Scorsese’s faith in the material sustaining the film’s soul even when its cinematic flesh is weak.','https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/01/silence-martin-scorsese-review-grim-pilgrimage-liam-neeson-adam-driver','Silence review – Scorsese’s grim pilgrimage',120,'film'),('artanddesign/2017/jan/01/rising-stars-2017-architecture-interrobang-engineering-maria-smith-steve-webb-andy-yates','Much of the time, talented young architects are viewed in a particular way – diverting, promising but not really grown up, not to be entrusted with projects of any consequence. Young engineers are treated more seriously, but are assumed to have no creative spark. It is to escape such perceptions, and the limitations they set, that Maria Smith, architect, and Steve Webb and Andy Yates, engineers, have set up Interrobang, a practice dedicated to “hybrid” and “anti-specialist” thinking. An interrobang, if you didn’t know, is a fusion of an exclamation point and a question mark. “It suggests adventure and questioning,” says&nbsp;Smith. Webb Yates Engineers worked on projects&nbsp;ranging from alterations to Gatwick&nbsp;and Heathrow airports to the Rain&nbsp;Room, a space full of falling water by the&nbsp;artists rAndom International at the Barbican arts centre. Maria Smith used to be&nbsp;half of Studio Weave, a practice known for&nbsp;delightful follies and temporary structures but in danger of being typecast as&nbsp;such. Smith and Webb are both eloquent and quick-thinking, with decided attitudes to what they do, and Smith was also the spectacular compere of something called Turncoats, a series of the least boring architectural events of recent years. Yates says less but, according to his partners, “is the only one who really knows anything”. Together, they can take on, from Smith’s&nbsp;point of view, “larger and more ambitious projects than I would have dared to dream”. For Webb and Yates, collaboration means they can expand the imaginative dimension of their discipline. They all want to destroy the convention that an architect’s job is to design pretty things and an engineer’s is to make them happen. Their larger projects include the conversion of the famous art deco Hoover Building in west London into flats and continued (and&nbsp;increasingly interesting) work with&nbsp;airports. With a lifting bridge over a canal in Smethwick, west Midlands, they hope to achieve what Webb calls a victory of “brain power over a mass of metal” – they propose to add outriggers to ward off collisions by boats, which means the structure can be far more delicate than usual. They are designing a mews house in south London – typical young architects’ fare, but a project informed by an engineer’s feeling about materials. Webb talks of the “utter stupidity of building in brickwork”, on practical and environmental grounds, so the facade is a clever composition of tiles. They all like the intellectual rigour of engineering formulas that, like music and mathematics, create a framework that makes it impossible “to bluff”. Smith is studying for an engineering degree in her evenings and weekends and says she has “started dreaming in equations”. Outcomes of their combined thinking include Back to the Stone Age, an installation at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum that showed how thin stone slabs could be used to make a self-supporting floor that would be more efficient than concrete and better looking. In works such as this, you can’t tell the architecture and the engineering apart, which is the point.

The project, an award-winning approach to help diagnose Alzheimer’s disease years before the telltale amyloid beta plaques appear in the brain, would be admirable in itself. But it is made even more impressive by the fact that Nithiyanandam is just 16. The Surrey schoolboy is no stranger to&nbsp;the press, having scooped headlines with his work, and there’s already a hint of the showman about him. “I had always wanted to do a research project really just because I thought doing something new would be quite cool,” he says. “At school you do experiments, but most of the time&nbsp;you are repeating experiments that have been done thousands of&nbsp;times before so it is difficult to get&nbsp;excited by it.” It was some time before Nithiyanandam started to pursue his idea in earnest. Playing squash – he is an avid player – he broke his pelvis. Twice. It was a calamity, but also an opportunity.

The work earned Nithiyanandam the $25,000 Scientific American Innovator award at the Google Science Fair last year. And there’s more attention coming his way. His latest idea, in collaboration with researchers at Cambridge University, is aimed at making hard-to-treat breast cancers more receptive to common drugs. The work has already swept him to the final of the UK’s National Science and Engineering Competition to be held in March 2017. “I’ve been there for the last two years as a finalist and haven’t won anything yet, so hopefully this year…” he says. While neither of his parents have&nbsp;a&nbsp;scientific background – his mother is an accountant-turned-secretary and his father is an IT consultant – both follow his projects closely. His friends offer their own&nbsp;form of support. “There are the&nbsp;odd jokes that fly here and there&nbsp;but I think they think it’s quite cool,” says Nithiyanandam, adding that he is now part of a small&nbsp;research group at his school. He is currently studying for his A-levels, and thoughts about his career have understandably been affected by his success. “I was pretty determined I was going to study medicine at university,” he says. “Now I am not sure whether I&nbsp;want to go into medicine, research or computer science.” Ultimately, he says, no one is too&nbsp;young to delve into research. “A&nbsp;degree is undoubtedly helpful and&nbsp;so is a PhD,” he says. “But coming up with the idea itself, anyone can do that – it is just whether you want to go for it.” Three more to watch ■ A stem cell scientist at the Francis Crick Institute in London, Dr Kathy Niakan made the Time 100 list after gaining permission to use genome-editing tool Crispr-Cas9 on human embryos to understand early human development. ■ Sheffield teenager Sarah Sobka made headlines after winning the 2015 National Science and Engineering Competition, earning her the title UK Young Scientist of the Year for her research into a potential drug for cystic fibrosis. ■ Co-founder, with Joel Gibbard, of Bristol-based robotics company Open Bionics, Samantha Payne is developing low-cost, custom-made prosthetics for children using 3D printing.

But supported by various public grants, it also functions, under his guidance, as a space for artists who want to learn more about making work with clay. Among its recent visitors was Anthea Hamilton, who made the prototype for the giant pair of buttocks that comprised her Turner prize-shortlisted Project for Door (After Gaetano Pesce) at Troy Town. Angell had hoped to lower that piece into the tank of his axolotl, whose environment, courtesy of the parade of artists coming through his door, changes every six months. “But it exploded in the second firing,” he says, with a mournful shake of his head. When Angell, who is 29, was at the Slade School of Art, working in clay wasn’t an option available to students. “I don’t know if that pushed me to want to do it more,” he says. “But in my final year, it occurred to me that if you had the right set-up, you had this infallible way of making sculpture.” He duly returned to his secondary school in Caterham, spent three weeks shadowing its ceramics technician and began the journey that eventually brought him here. “The process is frustrating. Anyone can buy a bag of clay and a readymade glaze. But to do it properly, to make your own glazes as we do, you have to fail sometimes. That makes it a romantic, fatalistic thing. You’re almost working blind. Even the weather can affect a firing.” He likes clay’s human scale, its lack of preciousness, the fact that it comes from the ground. But he hates to be called a ceramicist, not least because he also paints: “Artist will do.” Angell is a co-curator of a forthcoming exhibition at Tate St Ives: That Continuous Thing: Artists and the Ceramics Studio, 1920 – Today. In the gallery he’ll oversee, he will show his own sculptures, historical pieces (one dates from 2000 BC) and a selection of work by artists who have visited Troy Town, as well as the tank that is home to his axolotl, complete with five rotating environments. “I’ve put so much work into it,” he says. “It’s a feast of arrangements.” Later in the year, he is to be an artist-in-residence, supported by the Tate, at the Leach Pottery in St Ives; looking further ahead, he will have solo shows at Glasgow’s Gallery of Modern Art and at Rob Tufnell’s new London space in a former ladies’ lavatory below Trafalgar Square. Things are busy. The atmosphere at Troy Town, however, remains almost uncannily quiet and peaceful, for which I blame the axolotl. In her tank, she strolls blithely back and forth, blissfully unaware of her impending new role as a star of the art world.

She practised with her dancing partner – who is “also my fiance” – and remembers a tango with lots of turns and spins – just like the unusual thriller she would go on to write. In Yesterday&nbsp;there are two sorts of people: those who can only remember what happened yesterday (“monos”) and superior mortals who can also remember the day before yesterday (“duos”). They all depend on their iDiaries in lieu of a past. When Claire, a trusting “mono” wife, learns that her “duo” husband, Mark, has a mistress whose body was found drowned in the river, she seeks answers. But what does she know? What can she hope to remember? The thriller is an intriguing, philosophical page-turner that concludes: “We are all&nbsp;victims of the past we prefer.” At 35, Yap is a phenomenon – her own past extraordinary. She looks like a dainty dancer and has been talent-scouted as a model. She grew up in a “tiny house” in Kuala Lumpur, the daughter of a banker – although the family was not well off.&nbsp; She affectionately recalls her father’s car, “an old, dusty brown Datsun with holes in the floor”. When I ask which past she prefers, it turns out to be a leading question. Yap studied biochemistry at Imperial College London and went on to become a researcher at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg. She then decided – extraordinarily – to jump tracks and became a Cambridge historian, researching the experiences of people in the east caught up in the second world war. Add to that her journalism for publications such as the Economist and Singapore’s Business Times – she is an astonishing chameleon. But it is writing novels that makes Felicia happiest. When Yesterday was being auctioned, she remembers waiting in front of her computer – she was away, travelling – for news (Headline won with a six-figure sum): “I felt euphoric and anxious,” she says. She confirms – but only when pushed – that there is keen and ongoing competition for the film rights. She is at pains to thank Richard Skinner, her tutor at the Faber Academy, and tells a revealing story about how she came to be on the course in the first place. Ordinarily she does not accept friends on Facebook unless she knows them. But she made an exception for a woman who looked unusually sympathetic. She sent her a message: “Have we met?” The woman explained she had mistaken Yap for a former classmate from the Faber Academy. “I reasoned that if someone thinks I’m an alumna there, perhaps I should become one. Perhaps it is written.” Malleable as a fictional character herself, Yap brims with alternatives. A rising star for sure – but will she stay a novelist? She volunteers that she is already working on a prequel to Yesterday. Whatever she chooses to do, tomorrow is sure to be dazzling.

Irving Berlin’s instant hits are still on target: There’s No Business Like Show Business, I Got the Sun in the Morning and, my all-time favourite, You Can’t Get a Man with a Gun, “as good a comic song as has ever been written by anybody”, according to Stephen Sondheim. But the action? Well, out of its time, that can seem more than a little off-key. Book (by brother-sister writing team Dorothy and Herbie Fields) and lyrics play around cultural assumptions about race and sex. They send up stereotypes, yet rely on audiences to appreciate them to get the joke. The joke wore thin. In 1999, a revised version excised much material featuring indigenous peoples. It’s this reworking that director Paul Foster bases his production on. But any attempts to shoot stereotypes out of the show have missed. A subplot featuring showman Frank’s assistant, Dolly, inspiring the love of an indifferent man through her reaction to an imagined assault, is racially offensive and sexist. Time spent on Annie’s wilting longing for Frank, who does nothing dramatically to win her love, is disproportionate.Sharp sets (Laura Hopkins) and even sharper tunes (musical director Paul Herbert) and choreography (Alistair David) can’t compensate for too little action and too much moping. Only one thing almost persuades me that this bashed-about rehash is worth staging and that is Anna-Jane Casey’s performance as Annie: here, anything she can do, none can do better. • Annie Get Your Gun is at the Crucible Theatre until 21 January','https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jan/01/annie-get-your-gun-sheffield-crucible-review','Annie Get Your Gun review – out of time and short on ammo',127,'stage'),('music/2017/jan/01/kid-cudi-passion-pain-demon-slayin-review-feels-like-a-group-hug','Since his breakout single, Day ’n’ Nite, reached No 2 in the UK eight years ago, Scott Mescudi’s career under the rapping name Kid Cudi has been characterised by sharp stylistic swerves into rock and open struggles with depression and drugs.

We’ve perhaps been idealising it a little: “I can’t wait for this year to be over,” people would say in response to every nightmare 2016 threw up, as if a mere change of digit would make all the difference. Still, if you fancy getting the new year off to a gentler start, you could do worse than Ethel &amp; Ernest (Universal, PG), Roger Mainwood’s delicate, melancholic and adoringly realised animated adaptation of Raymond Briggs’s autobiographical graphic novel. Detailing the half-century-spanning relationship between Briggs’s salt-of-the-earth parents, from first date to last goodbye, Mainwood has fashioned a film in which every dramatic conflict lands like a goose down pillow. It’s a very English, composed celebration of unconditional familial love and risks tipping into an overly romantic exercise in 20th-century nostalgia. Then again, as Ethel and Ernest, voiced by Brenda Blethyn and Jim Broadbent, repeatedly spar over their opposing politics, the film also plays as a wry blueprint of the Brexit voter’s rose-tinted England. Alternatively, if you’re in the mood for quiet tenderness with a shade less cuteness, head over to Netflix, where Ira Sachs’s gorgeous teenage friendship study Little Men has skipped DVD to land on the streaming service, just in time to soothe some New Year’s Day hangovers. Exquisitely observed and immaculately cast, the film has an innate, unforced understanding of male adolescent breakability and bravado, embodied in the chalk-and-cheese pairing of withdrawn Jake (Theo Taplitz) and bolshy Tony (Michael Barbieri), who forge a deep bond as their parents fight a cross-class battle over Brooklyn property inheritance. The unhappy practicalities of the adults’ world is presented in stark contrast to the boys’ purer, sweeter search for their own identities. Sachs hints oh so subtly at the crises they might eventually face, without preserving their innocence in amber. Though the adult players are uniformly terrific, notably Chilean actress Paulina Garcia as Tony’s hard-up seamstress mum, it’s Taplitz’s aching vulnerability and Barbieri’s eccentric swagger that stick. As nasty and nihilistic as Sachs’s film is generous and humane, Paul Schrader’s Dog Eat Dog (Signature, 18) at least finds the veteran chronicler of society’s seamier underside – an awfully long way from the insights of Taxi Driver – attacking lurid genre terrain with stomach-churning brio. You can’t accuse the film’s neon-nightmare atmospherics of being half-hearted. The film’s hunger to shock, coming straight out of the gate with a grisly, drugged-up double murder, is so all-consuming that its sleazily tangled yarn, involving Nicolas Cage and a bug-eyed Willem Dafoe ineptly kidnapping an infant, seems an afterthought. Perhaps London Town (High Fliers, 15) could borrow some of its surplus bad attitude: Derrick Borte’s peculiar musical semi-biopic welds a would-be gritty portrait of the Clash to a sentimental coming-of-age narrative to awkward effect. The rerelease of the week is a cracker. As taut and terse today as it must have seemed in 1953, Carol Reed’s chiaroscuro espionage thriller The Man Between (Studiocanal, U) tends to get filed away in The Third Man’s shadow, but deserves its own platform. Anchored by a typically suave, opaque James Mason, this morally complex tale of a former Nazi caught up, along with prim, innocent Claire Bloom, in a border-blurring Soviet-German abduction plot startles even today with the tougher twists of its melodrama.','https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/01/ethel-ernest-raymond-briggs-little-men-paul-schrader','Ethel & Ernest; Little Men; Dog Eat Dog; London Town; The Man Between – review',129,'film'),('stage/2017/jan/01/art-old-vic-observer-review-rufus-sewell','In 1998, Yasmina Reza won a Laurence Olivier award for Art. The prize was for comedy. Reza, who is French, was surprised: “I thought I had written a tragedy.” But her drama pivots on a piece of modern art. Of course the British were going to think it a joke. Twenty years after the play’s first London staging, attitudes have shifted. The white canvas over which three male friends fall out – is it beautiful? Is it just blank? – is less likely to be regarded as self-evidently the peak of pretentiousness. Still, derision usually trumps enthusiasm; a jeerer has an easier time being thought intelligent than an acclaimer. Rufus Sewell, sleek and poised as the man who buys the painting for €100,000, is at first greeted with superior titters. The sceptic Paul Ritter, a knot of irritation and scorn (all his limbs are crossed), seems to have won the day. But things change. Ritter’s contempt is so vituperative that it begins to look excessive. In a smart piece of visual argument, Hugh Vanstone’s lighting design throws a pattern of light on to one wall, as if through an unseen venetian blind. It looks like a rival painting; it suggests that white need not be plain or dull. The drama clicks around like a Rubik’s Cube, each short scene offering a change of perspective. It is, of course, not really about painting but about friendship. Friendship that is destroyed as much by the way people speak as by what they do. Ah, the wincing when someone parrots a piece of jargon. In a talkative world, a lack of irony can seem like infidelity. Art ran for eight years in the West End. Success breeds suspicion. I was braced to think it all veneer. I found the reverse. The verbal dexterity – Christopher Hampton’s translation is crystalline – is evident. As is the theatrical aplomb. This trio make the sharing of a bowl of olives look like a power game. But Matthew Warchus’s production also suggests a stirring of hearts. Tim Key, sweetly blurting as the man who hovers between opposed opinions, elicits a rare sound in the stalls: an audible whimper of sympathy. • At the Old Vic, London, until 18 February','https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jan/01/art-old-vic-observer-review-rufus-sewell','Art review – 90s ‘comedy’ becomes an old master',130,'stage'),('film/2017/jan/01/crash-and-burn-observer-review','This documentary about the rise and fall of Tommy Byrne, a talented but troubled also-ran on the motor racing circuit, is most interesting for the insight it gives into the ugly, elitist attitudes in Formula One.

Yet later that same day Margaret Thatcher and her government decided not to take any action, against what ministers admitted was a “ruthless” regime, for fear of jeopardising lucrative exports to Iraq. In memos written two years after Saddam used mustard gas to slaughter more than 3,000 Kurds and only months before he marched into Kuwait, sparking war, newly released cabinet documents reveal that trade was still the uppermost concern for ministers. Even as the news of the hanging of the 31-year-old reporter was coming in, and despite public promises of firm action against what was clearly an increasingly dangerous dictator, cabinet ministers decided not to impose any sanctions. Trade or credit restrictions on Iraq would be “ineffective in influencing the attitude of the Iraqi government” and would inflict “disproportionate damage on UK industry”, Norman Lamont, a future chancellor but at that time the chief secretary to the Treasury, noted in a memo to foreign secretary Douglas Hurd, the files disclose. “Opinion here has been deeply shocked by Iraq’s behaviour,” Hurd conceded in reply, before making clear he shared Lamont’s concerns. “We have a considerable commercial presence to protect in Iraq,” he wrote. Lamont, now Lord Lamont of Lerwick, told the Observer that he had little memory of events from 27 years ago and thought it unlikely he would have had much input into any action taken by Britain against Saddam’s government. “I have no recollection of being involved in this sad story, although I remember vividly being shocked by the tragic death of the young man,” he said. “There was some argument about how British was he – he did have an Iranian passport and that was the decisive thing: he wasn’t a British citizen.” Bazoft, an Iranian-born freelance reporter who held British residency, had been invited by Saddam’s government to visit Iraq with other journalists on a group trip to report on elections planned for the country’s Kurdish areas. It was his sixth visit to the country and he was keen to get a story that the Observer could use. The day he left, in September 1989, the Independent published a report about an explosion in August at the al-Hillah military complex south of Baghdad, suspected of modifying ballistic missiles and secretly manufacturing chemical weapons. There were rumours of hundreds of deaths. Bazoft asked a British nurse, Daphne Parish, to drive him out there: he took photographs and collected soil samples. He was arrested at Baghdad airport while waiting for his flight back to London. He was incarcerated at Abu Ghraib prison where he was kept in solitary confinement, starved and beaten. On 1 November he was placed in front of television cameras and confessed to being an Israeli agent. In 2003, the Observer tracked down Kadem Askar, the colonel in the Iraqi intelligence service who interrogated Bazoft. He admitted that he knew Bazoft was innocent, but that he was powerless to obstruct Saddam’s personal orders to have him convicted and executed. Within months of Bazoft’s death – his body was unceremoniously returned to his parents in the UK, turning up at Heathrow unannounced in a rough box – Saddam had sent his troops over the British-drawn border between Iraq and Kuwait in the invasion that sparked the Gulf war of 1990-91. The files from March 1990 were released as part of an initiative to gradually reduce the embargo on official government files from 30 years to 20, and are among Cabinet Office papers from 1989 and 1990 that are now available to the public at the National Archives in Kew, west London. They reveal that Charles Powell, Margaret Thatcher’s foreign affairs adviser, told the prime minister that there was little doubt there would be calls to suspend credit or impose trade restrictions on Saddam’s Iraq. He added: “But we would not get international support for this and it would not actually achieve anything.” Lamont agreed. Five days after Bazoft was hanged, Hurd warned: “In the atmosphere brought about by our present difficulties, Iraq would see any action against credit as a further political response to Bazoft and would hit back hard. That would be bad for our wider commercial interests where our competitors would happily step in to take up our share of the market.” The only action the Thatcher government took was not to subsidise a planned Birmingham trade mission to Iraq and avoid giving publicity to it, the hitherto classified documents show. During Bazoft and Parish’s six-month imprisonment, smear stories and allegations against him appeared in several newspapers. Saddam said the two were British or Israeli spies. There has never been any evidence to support the allegation and, indeed, records uncovered in Baghdad in 2003 showed Saddam was well aware of this and simply wanted a “punishment for Margaret Thatcher” and to humiliate Britain. A one-day trial of the two was held in secret – in Arabic, which neither defendant understood – and without any defence. Parish was sentenced to 15 years in jail. Ten months after Bazoft’s death, she was allowed to return to the UK. Two backbench Tory MPs at the time repeated the notion that Bazoft was a spy, something picked up by newspapers, and there had long been suspicion that another story, revealing Bazoft had acquired a criminal record as a young man, had been leaked to discredit him. Certainly the government was aware of his past. The files at Kew contain a note sent by Sara Dent, private secretary to David Waddington, then home secretary, to Powell before Bazoft’s execution. “You might wish to know,” she said, “that from our inquiries on his immigration files, Mr Bazoft, the Observer journalist who has been sentenced to death for spying in Iraq, has a criminal record in this country.” Dent added: “Although this has no bearing on his sentence in Iraq, it may be raised by the Iraqis or by the press.” She noted that Bazoft had arrived in 1975 as a student. Four years later, he was in financial difficulties and his application for an extension to his stay was refused. He went into a building society, threatened to blow it up and demanded money from a cashier. He obtained £475 – the amount he was in debt – and was arrested later that day. There was no bomb but he was sentenced to 18 months in prison. His deportation order was revoked after evidence emerged that Iran had issued a warrant for his arrest as an “anti-revolutionary”. His family were critics of Ayatollah Khomeini and he had been allowed to stay in the UK on an “exceptional basis”, Dent wrote. She ended her note to Powell by saying that the Home Office “proposed not to volunteer this information but not deny it if it is raised with us”. Tabloid newspapers gave prominent front-page coverage to Bazoft’s previous criminal conviction, while MPs Rupert Allason and Terry Dicks slated his character. Lord (Woodrow) Wyatt told his News of the World readers that Britain should “start maximising trade and stop talking about Farzad Bazoft”. Donald Trelford, then editor of the Observer, described the coverage of Bazoft’s imprisonment and execution by some editors on Fleet Street as “persistently hostile”. He said that, even 20 years on, it remained hard to “contain one’s anger – not just at the insane barbarity of Saddam, but at some Tory MPs and the parts of the British press that tried to pin the blame for his murder on poor Farzad himself”. That the government of the day had consistently turned a blind eye to atrocities committed by Saddam became clear at the Scott arms-to-Iraq inquiry set up by John Major after the collapse of a trial of the directors of a Coventry-based machine tools firm, Matrix Churchill. It emerged during the trial that the directors were encouraged by MI5 and MI6 to spy on Saddam’s weapons programme when they visited Iraqi factories. Chemical weapons were known to have been used by Saddam during the Iran-Iraq war and, in March 1988, Iraqi warplanes attacked the Kurdish town of Halabja with chemical weapons, gassing between 3,000 and 5,000 men, women and children. At that time, the government had decided to relax controls on arms exports to Iraq. The files, released last week, include a document from 1989 in which the private secretary of the former Tory chancellor and foreign secretary, Geoffrey Howe, notes that Tariq Aziz, Saddam’s foreign minister, had promised that Iraq would not use chemical weapons in future. At the time ministers were planning to increase export credit guarantees for Iraq in the hope that British companies would win further contracts. Later that year, Hurd told Thatcher: “The Iraqi regime is ruthless and disagreeable but its influence is growing following the Iran/Iraq conflict [which ended in 1988].” He warned of the dangers of taking measures that would damage “British business”. Also in the National Archives is a copy of a letter Thatcher sent to Saddam after the decision to release Parish. Dated 16 July 1990, it reads: “I was very pleased to hear of your Excellency’s decision to release Mrs Daphne Parish on humanitarian grounds … We have long-standing ties and there are many positive aspects to our relations on which we can build.” A plaque and photograph remembering Farzad Bazoft remain in place in the Observer newsroom Iraq and Britain: a short history 1941 Iraq is reoccupied by Britain, less than a decade after gaining independence from British mandate. 1975 Iranian-born Farzad Bazoft, aged 16, comes to live in the UK with his parents. 1979 Saddam Hussein, of Iraq’s Arab nationalist Ba’ath party, becomes leader. 1980 Iran-Iraq war begins, ending in stalemate eight years later. 1981 Israeli air raid destroys nuclear reactor near Baghdad. 1988 Saddam attacks Kurdish town with poison gas.

They are both later arrested. 1990 Newspapers run stories based on a Tory MP’s false claim that Bazoft was a spy. His criminal record is leaked to the press. On 15 March Bazoft is executed.

This spring, however, the shelves reflect a rather more terrifying kind of inclement weather. The world being in crisis, we are about to be inundated with books that worry away at global rage, the new populism, and the effect of the internet on both. Among the titles on this rocky terrain are Pankaj Mishra’s Age of Anger: A History of the Present (Allen Lane), in which the author attempts to trace the tangled roots of the many hatreds and nationalisms currently sweeping the planet; Jamie Bartlett’s Radicals (William Heinemann), which examines the motivations and methods of the followers of, among others, Isis, Beppe Grillo and Jeremy Corbyn; Daniel Levin’s Nothing But a Circus: Misadventures Among the Powerful (Allen Lane), an anthropological portrait of unscrupulous global elites by one with first-hand experience of how they work; and Jonathan Taplin’s Move Fast and Break Things: How Facebook, Google and Amazon Have Cornered Culture and What It Means for All of Us (Macmillan), a manual that will probably not, I hazard a guess, tell us anything terribly happy-making about our screen lives. It’s possible, though, that in the UK, Sayeeda Warsi’s The Enemy Within: A Tale of Muslim Britain (Allen Lane) may end up causing more of a stir than all of them put together, given her vexed relationship with the Conservatives, the party of which she was once vice-chair. Warsi, her publisher promises, unpicks the challenges ahead for British Muslims with “brutal honesty”. Memoir continues to be important – perhaps too important? – to publishers, who will doubtless have been encouraged by the way it dominated the nonfiction prize shortlists in 2016, all but pushing aside traditional biography. The one I’m looking forward to more than any other is The Rules Do Not Apply by Ariel Levy (Fleet), which tells the story of how its journalist author built a successful and unconventional (by some standards) life, only to watch it crumble to dust. Levy is a fantastic writer and reporter, cool-headed, witty and entirely without self-pity, and this chronicle of what it means to be a woman who is free to do as she chooses comes with advance praise from, among others, Lena Dunham and Alison Bechdel. I’ve also heard good things about Sam Miller’s Fathers (Cape), which delicately unpicks a family mystery no one ever spoke about (he is the son of Karl Miller, the influential founding editor of the London Review of Books). And you should certainly make space in your reading life – sorry as I am to return so soon to the world in crisis – for The Raqqa Diaries: Escape from Islamic State by Samer (Hutchinson). These dispatches began as broadcasts on Radio 4’s Today programme, after reporter Mike Thomson and the BBC’s Arabic service found a young man who was willing to risk his life to tell the world what was happening in his city (part of a small anti-Isis activist group, the diaries were encrypted and sent to a third country before being translated). Horrifying, and unmissable. If you’re chasing major biographies this spring, the pickings are relatively slim. Still, in April, Thomas Dilworth’s long-awaited account of the life and work of the modernist poet and artist David Jones will be published, some 30 years after it was first commissioned. Jones is not an easy subject. Shy and reclusive, he remains far less well known and celebrated than his greatest admirers (TS Eliot most famously, but also Kenneth Clark, Dylan Thomas and Igor Stravinsky). But perhaps the lavishly illustrated and wonderfully well written David Jones: Engraver, Soldier, Painter, Poet (Cape) will go some way towards correcting this. Dilworth is that rare thing: a scholar who has the capacity for great clarity. Also worth a look is The Surreal Life of Leonora Carrington (Virago) by Joanna Moorhead. Carrington was Moorhead’s father’s cousin, and her narrative is informed by the friendship they established over pizza and tequila in the years before the artist’s death in 2011. The Good Bohemian (Bloomsbury) is a new collection of letters by Ida John, the first wife of the artist Augustus John, edited by her granddaughter, Rebecca John, and Augustus John’s biographer, Michael Holroyd; among the stories it tells is of Ida’s remarkable acceptance of her husband’s new lover, Dorelia, with whom she would share her life and home until her death at the age of just 30 from puerperal fever. The Essential Paradise Lost (Faber), John Carey’s spirited attempt to bring readers back to John Milton, combines a shorter version of his greatest poem with new insights into his inspirations and characters, while The Disappearance of Émile Zola: Love, Literature and the Dreyfus Case (Faber) is Michael Rosen’s (rumoured to be gripping) account of the novelist’s exile in London following the publication of his open letter, J’accuse. By now you may be wondering where to go in search of light relief. I’m avid to tuck into food historian Annie Gray’s The Greedy Queen: Eating with Victoria (Profile), a tale of the royal kitchens in the 19th century and their lasting influence on our own groaning tables. (Will there be cake? Yes, there will.) Or what about Emergency Admissions (Fourth Estate) by Kit Wharton? Someone who has read this book – it’s by a former journalist who now works as an ambulance driver, and comes with the full range of disgusting bodily discharges – told me that while it can be both sad and enraging, more often it is just very, very funny.

First, there’s Michael Chabon’s Moonglow (Fourth Estate). Taking in radicalism and rocket science, this is a wildly inventive and often very funny novel, and such a relief after its tedious predecessor, Telegraph Avenue. Speaking of tedious, Jonathan Lethem’s career has never quite regained the heights of Motherless Brooklyn and The Fortress of Solitude. The Blot (Jonathan Cape), out in February, tells of a telepathic backgammon shark with a brain tumour. It’s a return to form, absurd and digressive in a way that makes clear Lethem’s debt to Thomas Pynchon. Finally, and most surprisingly, there’s Paul Auster’s 4321 (Faber). Auster is 70 in 2017, which shocked me rather – I still think of him as a sprightly iconoclast. His new novel is so much better than anything since The Music of Chance, you wonder if it can really be by the same author as Invisible or Oracle Night. This meticulously plotted book weaves four possible stories out of the life of one man – Ferguson – who makes his way through the second half of the 20th century being buffeted by forces political and personal. Think a postmodern take on Kate Atkinson’s Life After Life. One’s heart goes out to the contemporary American novelist, for whom daily reality seems to outstrip the reach of both satire and dystopia. All the more impressive that a debutant, Nathan Hill, with his scintillating The Nix (Picador), has given us a character who comes close to out-Trumping Trump. Sheldon Packer is a bilious demagogue, just one of the many pleasures of this engaging story of a mother and son whose private travails become front-page news. Other first novels worth looking out for are Sympathy (One) by Olivia Sudjic, the best fictional account I’ve read of the way the internet has shaped our inner lives. A literary thriller that confirms the arrival of a major new talent. There’s also The Clocks in This House All Tell Different Times (Salt) by Xan Brooks – a fairytale wrapped within a historical novel, it’s as quixotic and dreamlike as Ishiguro’s The Buried Giant. Elif Batuman’s memoir of a life in love with Russian literature, The Possessed, was stunning and her first novel, The Idiot (Cape), is just as good – a moving, continent-hopping coming-of-age story. Brian Catling’s The Vorrh blew me away (along with my ideas of what fantasy novels should do) when it came out in 2012. I’ve just finished the second of the trilogy – The Erstwhile (Coronet) – and it’s even better. Set in London, Germany and Africa, the book features William Blake alongside its cast of monsters and adventurers. These are luminous and visionary novels – Gormenghast reimagined by Alan Moore on opium. Speaking of trilogies, Anthony Quinn’s Eureka (Cape), out in July, concludes the series that started with Curtain Call and last year’s excellent Freya. Mixing the Beatles, Antonioni and Henry James, it’s a joyful hymn to the 1960s. Last year’s procession of sucker-punches – Bowie (whump!), Brexit (pow!), Prince (argh!), Trump (clang!) – made us all feel like characters in a Greek tragedy, and so we should not be surprised that authors have turned to Sophocles and Aeschylus to explain the way we live now. Kamila Shamsie’s Home Fire (Bloomsbury) retells Antigone against the backdrop of contemporary London, weaving a poignant and timely tale of two British Muslim families with differing ideas about loyalty to the state. Natalie Haynes also takes on Sophocles in her vivid and affecting second novel, The Children of Jocasta (Mantle). Colm Tóibín, meanwhile, in House of Names (Viking), steps into the voice of Clytemnestra. This is a quite breathtaking work of fiction – every bit as powerful as Madeleine Miller’s Song of Achilles. In translation, there’s the second novel from Laurent Binet, whose HHhH, published in 2010, is one of my favourite books. The Seventh Function of Language (Harvill Secker), again translated by the superb Sam Taylor, is a rollicking crime caper about the death of Roland Barthes. It had me rolling on the floor of the Paris Metro when I read it last year. There’s also The Sad Part Was (Tilted Axis) by Prabda Yoon, translated by Mui Poopoksakul. These are evocative, erudite and often very funny stories of Bangkok life. This year’s historical fiction highlights have about them a distinctly macabre flavour, with Sarah Schmidt’s gory and gripping debut See What I Have Done (Tinder Press) reimagining the crimes of Lizzie Borden. Ben Myers’s The Gallows Pole (Bluemoose) may well turn out to be 2017’s His Bloody Project. It’s a windswept, brutal tale of 18th-century Yorkshire told in starkly beautiful prose. There’s also The Fatal Tree (Sceptre) by Jake Arnott. The fictional memoir of gangster Edgeworth Bess, this is a work of dazzling imagination and linguistic inventiveness. More excitement comes from the prospect of a second novel from Arundhati Roy. I was only semi-pubescent when the last one was published, and The Ministry of Utmost Happiness (Hamish Hamilton) is apparently worth the long wait. There’s also a new novel from the absurdly gifted Jon McGregor, seven years after the Impac-winning Even the Dogs. Reservoir 13 (Fourth Estate) is haunting and heartbreaking, the tale of a disappearance and its aftermath – his best yet. Edward Docx’s Let Go My Hand (Picador) tells the deeply tender story of a son, his dying father, and a journey they must take together. You should look out for three powerful novels of married life – Amanda Craig’s sharply satirical The Lie of the Land (Little, Brown); Gwendoline Riley’s devastating and stylish First Love (Granta); and KatieKitamura’s electrifying A Separation (Clerkenwell Press), which I&nbsp;read in one&nbsp;breathless sitting. Finally, three short story collections that catch the eye. Tessa Hadley’s Bad Dreams (Cape) is typically lapidary, full of the most gorgeous sentences and brilliant observations. Adam O’Riordan’s Burning Ground, (Bloomsbury), a collection of stories set in California, is wonderfully lyrical and bittersweet. Then there’s Pulitzer-winner Viet Thanh Nguyen’s The Refugees, whose eight heart-wrenching and hopeful stories ought to be required reading for every politician in this era of wall-building and xenophobia. • To order any of these titles for a special price go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.

Its past is wrapped up with that of the country itself. Now it somehow has to represent the complex and precarious history of Estonia, in a fraught present, with a combination of pride and sensitivity. For a European country to build a national museum at this moment, when nationalism is taking new and unpredictable forms, is perilous. If Russia were to invent such a thing now, it would look like another form of aggressive aggrandisement; if Britain, an episode of querulous post-Brexit blue-passport patriotism; if Germany, it would raise issues too agonising for a single museum to handle. Estonia, a country of 1.3 million, whose two periods of independence – between the wars and since 1991 – add up to less than 50 years, and which still has grounds to be nervous of its neighbour Russia, has reason to define and assert itself with a museum, but it also has to tread cautiously. The idea of a national museum has been linked to the idea of Estonian independence for more than a century, ever since a group of nationalist-minded intellectuals decided to create such a thing. Since then the fluctuating fortunes of independence, war and occupation have caused the collections to be housed in different places, to be dispersed and reassembled. Under postwar Soviet occupation the contents and concept of the museum were threatened. In the late 80s the call to reinstate the museum was part of a new campaign for freedom. The new €70m building is the fulfilment of this desire, after many years of debate and interruptions since Estonia won back independence in 1991. Its location, according to the usual logic of maximising visitor numbers, is near-suicidal. It is not in the capital Tallinn but 190km away in the second city, Tartu (population 100,000), and not precisely there either but a 2km journey through sometimes brutal weather from the centre. But what the site lacks in accessibility it makes up for in significance: it includes the remains of a manor house, wrecked in 1944, in which the collections were housed between the wars. It also includes an airstrip, with associated earthworks for protecting warplanes, used by the Soviet military. With the aircraft roaring over the ancient university town of Tartu, it was a symbol of the hatefulness of occupation. The design of the building is the result of a competition held in 2005 and won by a multinational trio of young architects, the Italian-Israeli Dan Dorell, the French-Lebanese Lina Ghotmeh and the Japanese Tsuyoshi Tane, who were working in the London offices of David Adjaye and Norman Foster and sacrificing sleep and leisure to work on their entry in their spare time. Entrants could choose a site somewhere in the grounds of the old manor house. DGT (as the three called themselves once they became an architectural practice) selected a location at the end of the old runway. For the architects it was important not to erase the past – that as Dorell says, the museum could be “mature enough to get over the trauma”. The building, 355m long, projects the straight lines of the runway back towards the city. Its glass sides, imprinted with a white pattern, are designed to reflect surrounding trees and snow. Its roof gradually slopes upwards until it forms a grand portico at the main entrance. At one point the building bridges a lake, one of a sequence that originated in the manor house’s landscape garden. Courtyards puncture the block, introducing fragments of nature. The interior is spacious and airy, with views to the outside seen through layers of glass. It was a controversial choice, to draw attention to the most negative part of the site’s history. There were also strong lobbies for placing the museum somewhere else entirely, in the centre of Tartu or in Tallinn. The European Union, not liking the remote location, refused to contribute to its cost. There were objections to the appointment of foreign architects for this national emblem. The 2008 crash slowed things down. For all these reasons it took more than a decade for the designs to be realised, during which time DGT set up their office and based themselves in Paris, all the time battling to realise what would be a spectacular first project for any practice, working unpaid when necessary – “we were ready for anything to make this happen”. They credit the “miracle” of its realisation to its former director Krista Aru – “to the strength of that woman” – and to “our belief”. The outcome is a contrasting combination of national and international, folkloric and modern, charged and cool. The building is glassy, geometric, hard-surfaced, straight-lined. The contents tend to be handmade, everyday, sometimes rough-hewn, often in the country’s most abundant material, which is wood. The aim of the museum is not to record grand historical events so much as the lives that ordinary people lived through them. Nor is it just about exhibits – music and drama are held there, such that the museum becomes in effect a very large village hall. The origins of the collection are in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when 1,400 volunteers toured the towns and villages of the not-yet-recognised country to gather texts and artefacts of popular folklore. To these have been added mementoes of lives since then, through the turbulence of the 20th century. There are for example the charms, pagan in origin, that peasants used to bring luck to their fields centuries after the country was supposedly Christianised. There are 2,600 ornamental wooden beer tankards, large and individually personalised. There are medals won by pilots, an art deco radio, rusted military material from the airfield, early photographs of cautiously squinting country people. Struggles against foreign rule – the country has at different times been run by Swedes, Germans and Russians – are there, but mostly discreetly. There is a video of the Baltic Way of 1989, in which 2 million people joined hands across the three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. There is a bookcase that reconstructs the way in which, under the Soviets, cohesion came from oppression: restricted in many ways, Estonians turned to discussions of literature, in turn limited by the small range of titles available, which were mostly translations of classics such as Dickens. There is a lawnmower from a time when it was impossible to buy such a machine, a little monument of persistence and ingenuity, handmade out of a pushchair, a washing machine motor and a bucket. The patriotism is a little more overt in a reverential room in which the first Estonian flag, made by students in the late 19th century and banned in Soviet times, is displayed. There are also large basement galleries dedicated to the peoples deep in Russia who speak languages in the same Finno-Ugric group as Estonian, a partly conjectural display of festivals and reconstructed cabins. This is tricky stuff, not least for the large Russian minority within Estonia, but it is mostly negotiated with tact. The museum could be both triumphalist and sentimental, but it is neither. At their best the displays are touching and revealing rather than heroic. The architecture plays its part by combining the drama of its setting and a striking overall form with a deadpan delivery. Views are offered of the ruin and of the landscape, downward to water and upward to sky, and long perspectives to the runway, but without exclamation marks. The temptation to invent a style somehow Baltic-looking has been avoided. If these are good instincts they also mean that the building, contents and setting will take some getting used to each other. It is a long way from the contemporary sharpness of the glass to a wooden beer tankard, a distance that the designers of the exhibition installations have tried too hard and intrusively to close. The surrounding landscape, much of which had to be dug up to remove contamination left by the airbase, is still raw. The museum is a project unlikely as the lawnmower, or indeed Estonia itself, which relies on passion for the theme to override disadvantages of location. So far it seems to be working, with about 60,000 visitors in each of its first two months. It is also a work in progress, not least because the museum is still inviting Estonians to contribute their personal objects. This is as it should be, as identity is something that never stands still.','https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jan/01/estonia-national-museum-review-touching-and-revealing-dgt-dorell','Estonian national museum review – touching and revealing',136,'artanddesign'),('music/2017/jan/01/slim-gaillard-searching-for-you-review-mcvouty-rarities-collected-lost-singles-1958-1974','Something suitably cheerful and timelessly weird to see the new year in.

The time between Christmas and new year (Boxing Week? Twixtmas? Resolution Run-Up? Slobba-lobba-ding-dong?) is always an odd one for broadcasters. They get as many shows prerecorded as possible, and then bus in the second-in-commands for news. Everything’s slightly skew-whiff. Evidence: on Friday, Johnnie Walker had a special show. Instead of his Sounds of the Seventies or even a regular Johnnie Walker Meets… he had the sound of Peter Kay, as he and Kay drove around Bolton and Manchester in Kay’s car, listening to tracks that each had chosen. I tuned in with trepidation. Peter Kay only agrees to go on TV or radio if he can take over. He’s a broadcast bully, a chat-show terrorist, taking everyone hostage from host to guests to audience. Though I enjoy his standup (if Michael McIntyre has his finger on the pulse of the suburban south, Kay knows what makes northerners howl), I can’t watch him on live TV. He makes everything about him. It’s maddening. And at the beginning of the programme he did exactly this, hogging the mic as though it were his show rather than Walker’s. Plus, his hijack clearly began before they had even started recording, when they’d met at Piccadilly station and Kay shouted at a punter that Walker was his long-lost dad and he’d just found out he was adopted. Funny, of course… but no one else had a choice. Nobody ever does with Kay. Gradually, though, Kay let Walker speak and managed to get some lovely stuff from the long-time music fan, especially about the Beatles and being a DJ in San Francisco when the Sex Pistols played their last gig. Of seeing the Beatles in 1963, on a Saturday night in Handsworth, Walker said: “They inspired me to do something different. Four blokes who made this amazing music, had this great sense of humour, and the world was going nuts. They played two gigs in one night… It was the freedom and potential of being young and being yourself and really having a go at something.” Lovely stuff from him, and in the end from Kay too. Music has a way of unwinding people into revealing themselves, and a relaxed Kay was far more charming than his usual hyperactive show-off. Plus, he played Frank Wilson’s Do I Love You (Indeed I Do), so we can forgive him a lot. Another northern comedian, Victoria Wood, managed to always be gracious, and her 2007 Desert Island Discs – rebroadcast on Christmas Day as part of the Absent Friends strand – was lovely to hear. Anyone who chooses Randy Newman’s Marie and the Doobie Brothers’ What a Fool Believes knows what music can do to your heart, and this show, her second Desert Island Discs appearance, is one I remember very clearly. Wood was so honest about her loneliness as a child, and the devastation of her marriage break-up; she let you in, and it made you love her more. No way would Peter Kay relinquish control enough to do that. Finally, if you’re feeling robust during this strange week, then try Love + Radio’s latest, Blink Once for Yes. Be warned: it’s heavy stuff. An accident, a family tragedy. Nothing we haven’t heard before, but presented and crafted by John Fecile, one of the family members, into an intensely compelling real-life story.

For me, the most striking lesson was the way it demonstrated how the internet has changed democratic politics. While there is no single, overarching explanation for Donald Trump’s election, his ascendancy would have been unthinkable in a pre-internet age, for two reasons. The first is that much of Trump’s campaign rhetoric would never have got past the editorial “gatekeepers” of an earlier era – the TV network owners and controllers, the editors of powerful print media and the Federal Communications Commission with its “fairness doctrine” (which required holders of broadcast licences to “present controversial issues of public importance and to do so in a manner that was, in the Commission’s view, honest, equitable and balanced”). The second reason is that in the pre-internet era, the multitudes of Trump’s vigorous, engaged and angry supporters would have had little option but to fume impotently in whatever local arenas they inhabited. It would have been difficult, if not impossible, for them to hook up with millions of like-minded souls to crowdsource their indignation and their enthusiasm for the candidate. So I think we can say that while the net may not have been a sufficient condition for Trump’s victory, it was definitely a necessary one. Most commentators, hypnotised by Trump’s mastery of Twitter and the prevalence of “fake news” on Facebook, attributed this entirely to social media. But again, this was an overly simplistic view, for it turns out that there was a deep structure underpinning most of what went on in social media and it needed some fairly intensive network analysis to reveal it. Much of the heavy lifting in this regard was done by Jonathan Albright, an academic at Elon University, a private liberal arts college in North Carolina, who, in a series of remarkable blog posts, explored the vast ecosystem of far-right websites that have been proliferating on the web for years. Professor Albright’s central idea is that journalistic analysis of social media activity (for example, plotting millions of Facebook reactions to a fake news story or hashtag-surfing social media) doesn’t get us very far. What we need to understand is the online infrastructure that feeds the frenzy and that is what he set out to map. What emerges from his work is a fascinating picture of what is effectively a rightwing propaganda machine built from more than 300 fake news sites and containing something like 1.3m hyperlink connections. Albright also mapped the hidden online trackers hosted by these sites. This is similar to the tracking ecosystem behind most commercial websites. But in the rightwing case, these trackers are coming away with information not about consumption preferences but about the possible political or ideological predilections of site visitors. One’s first reaction to Professor Albright’s maps, after the sharp intake of breath at the scale and intensity of the online activity implied by them, is to ask what would the comparable leftwing ecosystem be like? His tentative answer is that it appears to be significantly smaller and much less interconnected than the “alt-right” ecosystem. Which is where the really interesting questions begin. Why is the political extreme right so established and dominant on the net? The answer is probably that its members have been effectively excluded from mainstream political discourse for a long time. So the internet, with its intrinsic permissiveness, was, for them, the only available option. (Indeed, it still is.) And they went for it. Why have they been such effective exploiters of the technology? Among the possible reasons are: the fact that radicals and insurgents intuitively understand the power of simple messages; they are motivated and driven, are less scrupulous about the stories they tell and good at making the facts fit the narrative rather than the other way round. They understand&nbsp;propaganda, in other words. But their main advantage may be that they have understood the affordances of cyberspace better than most of their liberal opponents, in particular the way in which its undermining of traditional institutions has opened up a world in which people find it easy to discover information that supports rather than challenges their beliefs. In that sense, the far right may have taken on board Hannah Arendt’s observation about the ideal target for totalitarian propaganda being “people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction, true and false, no longer exists”. So it was quite a year. Let’s hope that this one is better.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/01/donald-trump-savvy-army-won-internet-war','How Trump’s savvy army won the internet war | John Naughton',142,'commentisfree'),('film/2017/jan/01/reset-ballet-observer-film-review','In 2009 veteran documentarian Frederick Wiseman released La Danse, an exhaustive, austere film, which explored the Paris Opera Ballet. It’s tempting to think that Wiseman’s fascinating, nearly three-hour documentary is the only film you need to watch about this somewhat stuffy institution. But then Benjamin Millepied took over as artistic director of the world’s oldest ballet company, and a new chapter started. If Wiseman’s restrained, thoughtful approach echoes the cautious atmosphere of the Ballet as it was, this stylish, dynamic picture captures the new energy that Millepied injected into this august organisation. A maverick talent best known outside the world of ballet for choreographing Black Swan and marrying Natalie Portman, Millepied is as charismatic as he is unconventional. This glossy, gorgeously photographed documentary focuses on the 39 days running up to the premiere of his first original production for the company. With his wide eyes, ready laugh and radically inclusive attitude to dance, Millepied exerts a formidable personal charm. And, given the celebratory approach of this film, which borders at times on gushing, it’s a charm that seems to have worked its magic on the directors.','https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/01/reset-ballet-observer-film-review','Reset review – dynamic portrait of a ballet master',143,'film'),('film/2017/jan/01/ben-affleck-my-dreams-have-true-come-at-a-price','Inside the glass-fronted office that is home to Pearl Street Films in Santa Monica, visitors are greeted by its owners, if not always in person then by their screen alter egos. In one corner stands a life-size mannequin wearing Matt Damon’s spacesuit from The Martian. There, glowering nearby, is another in Ben Affleck’s bat suit, complete with mask, pointy ears and a flowing cape. “What’s the good of doing a movie with great souvenirs if you don’t get to keep them?” deadpans Affleck. Damon and Affleck, Boston boys, best friends since childhood, have done good. Their production company also has an impressive track record. Pearl Street co-produced Damon’s last Jason Bourne movie and Affleck’s latest, the gangster epic Live by Night. It is behind the Oscar-tipped drama Manchester by the Sea, starring Affleck’s younger brother, Casey. Damon, in an interview with this magazine last year, joked that Affleck, now an Academy Award-winning director, always keeps the best roles for himself. “That’s true,” Affleck laughs. “But I’d love to get a great two-handed script and do a movie with Matt. But, for whatever reason, those scripts are rare.” He’s sprawled on the sofa dressed in blue jeans, trainers and grey sweatshirt. He sports dark stubble that blurs the chiselled jaw that matches his sportman’s physique. Though instantly recognisable, he still rises from the sofa and offers a firm handshake and an unnecessary but polite, “Hi, I’m Ben.” While his blockbuster films – such as Gone Girl and Argo (which he also directed) – have been watched by millions, his American TV appearances are also worth searching out. He sounds off on the HBO sports show Any Given Wednesday, effing and blinding like a bricklayer who’s just dropped a bag of cement on his toe. He’s equally at home slugging it out round for round with intellectuals and politicos on the current affairs programme Real Time. He’s as passionate about the injustice meted out to one of his favourite football players as he is about comments that veer close to Islamophobia. “I love a good debate and I get very energised by it,” he says. “On Real Time, I think people could tell I had a genuine emotional response because I strongly believe that no one should be stereotyped on the basis of their race or religion. It’s one of the most fundamental tenets of liberal thought.” Affleck grew up in a tough Boston neighbourhood and if someone picks a fight, he’s not about to back down. You can’t help thinking he’d have a head start if he ever thought of going into the pugilistic world of American politics. “But I really wouldn’t want to,” he says. “It’s not because I think being a public servant wouldn’t be satisfying, but it’s become a pure money-raising exercise from beginning to end. It’s small talk with people who you want to squeeze money out of. It’s sleazy. You have to have a certain tolerance to that kind of schmooze that I don’t have.” Talking of world-class schmoozing, it’s just weeks before Trump’s inauguration and Affleck is still trying to come to terms with his victory. He saw the signs in the US and the UK of populism on the rise. “I spent five months in London [last year] and I have to say the Brexit vote smacked of the same kinds of things I heard here. People whose overarching political agenda is that immigrants are ruining things for us or immigrants are getting one over on us somehow, taking advantage. In London, it’s Polish people and here it’s Mexican Americans. I still believe in the basic goodness of people, but that doesn’t mean we aren’t going through a spell where we’re in thrall to some ugly ideas and ugly notions.” It’s unlikely that an invite to the Trump White House will be landing on to his doormat anytime soon. “I met him once at a Fashion Week event in Milan. You knew you were at a cheesy party if Donald Trump was there. He would kind of trawl around them. He was famous for only granting permission for films to shoot on his real estate locations if they put him in as a cameo. The director Marty Brest told me he’d had to create a whole hand-shaking scene in Scent of a Woman where Trump comes out of the door and goes, ‘Hey! Donald Trump, nice to meet you,’ as he bumps into Al Pacino. The ego was there a long time ago.” Affleck’s own ego is more than satisfied with acting and directing. With Live by Night, based on a Dennis Lehane novel, he does both. He plays Joe Coughlin, a corrupt policeman’s son who runs with the bad boys in 1920s Prohibition Boston and falls for the girlfriend of his ruthless boss. When the boss finds out about their affair, Coughlin is lucky to escape with his life. He moves up the ranks with a rival mob, overseeing a rum-running operation. Affleck describes the movie as a love letter to the gangster flicks of the 1930s and 40s, and with a reported budget of $65m it’s his biggest movie to date. The era of fedora hats, braces and brogues fits Affleck’s classic matinee idol good looks, too. The first act is, once again, set in Boston just like two of his earlier films as a director, Gone Baby Gone and The Town. “I think you recognise what’s closest to home,” he says. “Wherever you were raised and formed your primary attachments and learned about life, that’s the world that’s most accessible to you. Dennis really gets Boston. He infuses his story with a love for the place, even if parts of it aren’t that lovable.” Although Affleck was born in California, his family moved to Cambridge on the outskirts of Boston when he was two. His father, Timothy, went from one job to the next – bartender, mechanic, janitor and, later, after battling alcoholism, an addiction counsellor. His mother, Chris, was a teacher. They separated when he was 12. “I guess contemporary helicopter parents would be aghast at our level of supervision, but it wasn’t bad. There were scary kids and people that you’d want to stay away from, but I tried to make people laugh and make friends.” His best friend, then and now, was Damon, two years older, who lived a few blocks away. They began acting at high school and as teenagers would go to auditions together. Damon went to Harvard and Affleck to the University of Vermont, but both dropped out and headed to Los Angeles to “live the dream”. “It was me, Matt, my brother Casey and a bunch of friends from Boston – all of them were trying to make it in some capacity or other. It was a time to experiment, to go to auditions and try stuff. And part of what we revelled in was the absurd level of frustration that we went through and the ridiculous hoops we had to jump through. Those years were wonderful – they were great, formative, blissful, fun, free years.” It was during those struggling years that he made his low-budget directorial debut in the insanely titled I Killed My Lesbian Wife, Hung Her on a Meathook, and Now I Have a Three Picture Deal at Disney. “Yeah, the title is the best thing about it,” he says. “It’s about how we sometimes forgive the lunatic behaviour of artists and call it “eccentricity”. I was trying to make it as an actor and hearing stories of how ‘so and so was doing this’ or ‘that guy has this outrageous technique’. And I remember thinking, “What bullshit.” Just because this guy’s on some crazy diet doesn’t make him talented. The work itself is what matters.” Sound advice that he, perhaps, should have remembered. In the early 2000s he made a series of disastrous film choices including Michael Bay’s overblown Pearl Harbor and the dreadful weepie Jersey Girl. At the same time, he became engaged to Jennifer Lopez and there were reports of drinking, gambling and a spell in rehab. “I’d always had a strong idea about my values and the direction I wanted to be headed in, then I ran into getting famous and it totally spun me around and I flailed around for a few years. When you’re a young man in your 20s, part of that is making mistakes and learning from them. I just made those in front of everybody, rather than privately. There’s stuff I look back on and kind of cringe at but I always tried to treat other people well. My parents imbued that in me and the mistakes I made were mostly just of the embarrassing kind.” The upswing in his professional fortunes coincided with the start of his relationship with the actress Jennifer Garner, the mother of his three children, Violet, 11, Seraphina, 7, and Sam, 4. “I think becoming a father makes you see the world differently and it’s good.” In 2015, he and Garner, his wife of 10 years, announced they were separating, although both insist they remain on good terms, despite the tabloid headlines claiming the split involved the couple’s nanny. The poster for Live by Night has the tag line “the American dream comes at a price”. He agrees it’s pertinent to his own life. “Absolutely. I’ve been lucky. I’ve had my wildest dreams come true, but the price is the Faustian exchange you make where your identity is not your own. You become a public figure and it changes all the rules,. The press can become invasive and dishonest, and you have to put up with inconvenient stuff like that. I’m at peace with paying my own price, what I’m not at peace with is when it invades on my kids’ space and time. They didn’t make any bargains. I try to shelter them as best I can. That’s my only real gripe.” Essentially, he insists, he’s the person he was before he won his Oscar for the Good Will Hunting script back in 1998. He credits Robin Williams with getting the film into production. “Most people can’t point to the moment that changed their life in such a dramatic way, but I can. It was the moment that Robin decided to take a flyer on that movie. I’ll always feel a huge debt to him although now I’ll never get to repay it.” Williams, who had dementia, took his own life in 2014. “It’s one of these incredibly horrible diseases that destroys the mind and that was especially cruel to a guy like Robin who was always so brilliant and quick witted. And on a totally selfish level, he’s the reason why I got successful in this business. If Robin hadn’t done Good Will Hunting, Matt and I would still be sitting there today talking about how we could update that script.” Instead, they’re sitting in their office, talking about other people’s scripts and their own film projects. Though the batman costume in the foyer is from Affleck’s caped crusader in Zack Snyder’s messy Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, word is that he will get to direct his own superhero movie, tentatively titled The Batman. “That’s the idea. But it’s not a set thing and there’s no script. If it doesn’t come together in a way I think is really great I’m not going to do it.” Ask him why he took the Batman role and he replies with characteristic honesty that he did it for his son. “Sam thinks his dad is Batman,” he laughs. “That’s an incredible feeling.” Everyone wants to be a superhero to their son, although it strikes me that one of the best things about Affleck is that he remains endearingly human.

Casey Nicholaw’s production of Tom Eyen and Henry Krieger’s show arrives in London 10 years after the movie, which starred Jennifer Hudson and Beyoncé.

In other words, Farzad Bazoft was a journalist to his core, good looking in that fine-boned Persian way, attractive to women and a man ever eager to find a good story with which to make his mark in Fleet Street. Any editor, and particularly a foreign editor, knows the infinite variety and the chaotic ways of reporters, especially freelancers who live by the special insights or the unique information they can bring to the newspaper. Any editor also knows the trouble they bring if they get into difficulties abroad. Farzad wasn’t the only one to get into trouble with a repressive regime or to fall into the wrong hands. Time and again Britons abroad find themselves in difficulties and time again their families complain of the same lack of support they get from the Foreign Office and the local embassy. It’s something to do with the attitude that British diplomats take to their task. US ambassadors are trained to see themselves as representing the “American people”, singly and as a whole. British officials see themselves as representing the Queen and her government, the state and its interests, not the people who get into personal difficulties. That was certainly the case with Farzad. All the advice not to make a fuss, that quiet diplomacy was the best route – which private families so often hear – was offered in Farzad’s case. It didn’t work, and couldn’t. Once he fell into the hands of the Iraqi security forces, all the discreet diplomacy with their oleaginous foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, counted for nothing. A British journalist was a catch that Saddam Hussein wanted to use to demonstrate his power against Britain and her prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. What is more he was a journalist rootling around Iraq’s closest secret, its arms programme. Only the toughest action by the British government could have got him released and that was not forthcoming. For all the emollient words offered by ministers to the Observer during Farzad’s imprisonment, usually with the sting “he’s not British after all” and the deliberate government leaking of his record of imprisonment, Britain was never going to confront Baghdad. The interests of the state were in selling it arms. It’s hard to say that it has changed since. Today’s ambassadors are chosen from a wider social background and are more willing to speak out about local conditions. But the arms sales and the secrecy goes on. You only have to look at the continuing block on information about anything to do with Saudi Arabia or the Gulf to see that. Thinking of Farzad, I sometimes comfort myself for failing to prevent him going on that trip and for not doing more to support him and his cause during those awful weeks of incarceration with the knowledge that, ultimately, it was what he wanted. He was on to a good story, a major explosion in one of Iraq’s top secret military facilities. If he had brought back proof of Saddam’s nuclear ambitions, it would have been a revelation of huge importance – although of course, as today’s shocking revelations suggest, our government would have played it down for fear of the effect on our own arms sales there.

Born in Hull, he left school at 16 and spent periods signing on and working in a pea factory before going to the National Film and Television School at 28. He is the curator of Made in Hull, a week-long event involving projections on and installations in landmark buildings, created by a team of local and international artists. Opening tonight, it launches Hull’s reign as UK City of Culture 2017. He and his partner, Ruth, live with their three children in Brixton. What’s the idea behind Made in Hull? We have a trail through the city that people can take for six hours each evening over seven days. It covers 75 years of a proud working city that has taken some knocks and has overcome them. Hull was the second most bombed city in the country in the second world war. Its heyday was in the 60s, when fishermen would come back from a three- or four-day fishing trip as millionaires. After that, the Icelandic wars [over territorial fishing rights] caused the demise of that industry and a recession. Now Hull’s the City of Culture, and it’s got this marvellous contract with Siemens [to build offshore wind turbines], which is bringing hope and jobs. What kind of artworks will we see? There’s a 15-minute surroundsound piece on the whole history in Victoria Square by Hungarian animator Zsolt Balogh. The caravan industry is big in Hull so we have a piece on the history of that in one shop window in Whitefriargate, and a caravan with actors performing a comedic piece in another. Jesse Kanda, who has worked with Björk, is doing a piece about nightclubbing, which was a big scene in Hull. And on the Deep, the aquarium on the Humber, we are doing a piece about immigration called Departures and Arrivals: Hull voted 68% to leave Europe, although it has been made up of a mix of people since [local anti-slavery campaigner] William Wilberforce’s time. Hull was voted “worst place to live” in the book Crap Towns in 2003… People embraced that [laughs]! They made T-shirts saying “It’s never dull in Hull”. Although of course it was. Now, within the city, there is so much going on subculturally, small things that just spring up and spread on social media. You go to a speakeasy or a performance poetry night and it is absolutely packed on a Monday night. What will being City of Culture mean to&nbsp;Hull? There is something about being at the end of the M62 – geographically it is the end of the road. There’s a kind of cultural disconnect with the rest of the world because of that. As City of Culture, for the first time, we feel people are looking in and interested in what is going on in Hull. This seems a departure from your international documentaries or studies of Hull’s working classes… I wanted to say no when I was offered it, but it was one of those once-in-a-lifetime opportunities that you can’t walk away from, and it opened my eyes to a different way of working, with a huge team, delegating a lot of the ideas. Our aim was to make the working-class population, 280,000 people, feel involved, because those people don’t naturally feel involved in what is called art or culture. Having worked in factories and come from that culture myself, I don’t naturally feel that is my world either. What does Hull mean to you? I have lived in Brixton for 20-odd years but when I talk about home, I still mean Hull. My parents are 92 and 93 and still live there, and my sisters and my friends. Whenever I have made a film abroad, I’ve always come back to make a film in Hull. I thought, if I’m going to make a film in Britain, I might as well make it in a place where no one else will [laughs].','https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/01/sean-mcallister-made-in-hull-city-of-culture','Sean McAllister, curator of Made in Hull: ‘We’re showcasing 75 years of a proud working city’',147,'uk-news'),('film/2017/jan/01/monster-trucks-observer-film-review','You can imagine the pitch meeting that spewed out this idea: what if monster trucks were actually powered by monsters? The result is a screenplay that takes every off-road narrative short-cut available and ploughs its massive, over-inflated tyres over the clear influences that came before: ET, Gremlins and The Iron Giant, to name but a few. A power company is drilling for oil in the hills above the small town where Tripp (Lucas Till) dreams of escape. The over-empathic score rumbles ominously when a company exec (Rob Lowe) sneers on to the screen, so it’s no surprise that he orders the drills to keep working at the expense of what might be an undisturbed ecosystem under the rocks. Three giant oil-drinking tentacled creatures escape, one of them taking up residence in Tripp’s half-built truck. It takes a special kind of cluelessness for a film to make the gas-guzzling monster the hero, but it’s likely that the target audience – children under 12 – will be so befuddled by all the noise and action that they won’t notice the inconsistencies.','https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/01/monster-trucks-observer-film-review','Monster Trucks review – a clueless family caper',148,'film'),('technology/2017/jan/01/video-games-2017-night-in-the-woods-resident-evil','In December, footage emerged of the Japanese film director Hayao Miyazaki visiting the Dwango Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in Tokyo. In the clip, which was broadcast as part of an NHK documentary, the director of Spirited Away is shown a video of a computerised humanoid creature that has taught itself to walk by using its head and buttocks to shimmy along the ground. After the presentation Miyazaki sits in thought, before issuing his verdict. “Whoever creates this stuff has no idea what pain is whatsoever,” he says. “I am utterly disgusted.” Miyazaki’s delivery has none of the vein-throbbing fury of a Gordon Ramsay – only the life-haunting melancholy of the disappointed father. “I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself,” Miyazaki adds. A devastated researcher reels from the blow, and judging by the look on his face&nbsp;may&nbsp;never recover from it. The video game medium, which stems as much from the computer science tradition as that of the arts, has often prioritised technological advancement over humanity and empathy in its on-screen depictions. Miyazaki’s wounding judgment could be considered to be anti-experimental (indeed, the researcher eventually protests, mournfully: “This is just our experiment”) but his perspective is a useful splash of cold water on an industry that can pursue technological invention at the expense of other considerations. As the trajectory of video game technology has levelled out in the past few years, the question of how to build and populate virtual worlds is giving way to the deeper, tougher question of why. In 2017 we can expect to see a huge range of answers to that question. This month’s Resident Evil 7, the latest entry in the long-running Japanese horror series, will take us to sweltering Louisiana, to explore the dark history of a hick family that could have stepped from one of Truman Capote’s grislier books. Here the goal is familiar and elemental: to exploit our fears. Night in the Woods has a different aim. College dropout Mae Borowski returns home to find an impoverished American community that has lost both hope and identity. It’s a game about how the collapse of industry gives rise to mental illness and desperation. Yakuza 0, by contrast, will whisk us into the criminal underclass of Tokyo’s Kabukicho district, where yakuza factions vie for domination in clashes that can affect the city and its populace in drastic ways. At times of great political and environmental turmoil it follows that the themes of our fiction would return to former landscapes as a way to wrestle with futuristic questions. HBO’s Westworld uses the wild west as a lens to examine our responsibility to robots. In a similar vein, Sony’s Horizon Zero Dawn explores how, in a world where humans are returned to hunter-gathering, we might work with robots to ensure the survival of our species. For the developers of 2017’s games, the fictional, tactile realities they create appeal to a range of human instincts. The hope surely is that, in their depictions, they treasure life rather than, as Miyazaki might put it, insult it.','https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/01/video-games-2017-night-in-the-woods-resident-evil','Video games for a more human new year',149,'technology'),('film/2017/jan/01/why-him-observer-film-review','A writer on both Meet the Parents and its sequel, Meet the Fockers, director and co-writer John Hamburg is already well versed in the comic possibilities of that excruciating first encounter between potential in-laws and prospective son-in-law. Here he approaches the uproarious culture clash between the strait-laced Fleming family from Michigan and their daughter’s tattooed hipster tech billionaire boyfriend, Laird (James Franco) with a relish that shows in a wealth of perceptive sight gags, and a whiplash comic timing that only flags at the end of the final act. Ned Fleming (Bryan Cranston), the well-loved boss of a printing company in Grand Rapids, is celebrating his 55th birthday when a Skype call from his Stanford student daughter Stephanie (Zoey Deutch) reveals a little more about her life than he had bargained for. Specifically, it reveals a secret boyfriend, and, mortifyingly for the buttoned-up Flemings, it reveals his naked buttocks, cavorting around her dorm room. Ned, his wife, Barb (Megan Mullally, excellent), and son, Scotty (Griffin Gluck), decide to spend Christmas in California in order to meet the new man in Stephanie’s life. Franco is a riot as Ned’s worst nightmare: part unfiltered id, part priapic puppy, he’s given to the kind of huggy, over-sharing intimacy that fills a small-town, meat-and-potatoes man like Ned with visceral horror. Even worse for the proud but struggling proprietor of a printing company is the fact that Laird’s slick hi-tech house is “paper free”. And yes, that includes the bathroom. An extended scene in which Laird’s estate manager and self-defence trainer Gustav (Keegan-Michael Key) fixes a malfunctioning automatic toilet is mortifyingly funny. It works as well as it does for two reasons. First, the details of Laird’s tech-funded play pad are brilliantly observed. Few things have made me giggle so much in a cinema this year as Laird’s absurd art collection. Second, although Ned and Laird are at odds, neither is portrayed as a monster. They are both inherently decent men, just positioned at opposite ends of a very broad spectrum. And if the film drags a little at the end, it’s perhaps because the film-makers were enjoying the company of these characters as much as the audience undoubtedly will.','https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/01/why-him-observer-film-review','Why Him? review – mortifyingly funny',150,'film'),('technology/2017/jan/01/best-apps-new-year-resolutions-2017','Stick to your reading goals Bookout (iOS – free) A common New Year resolution is a vow to read&nbsp;a new book every week and Bookout could keep your literary motivation high.

If we hadn’t been so keen to see the Star Wars movie the day after it opened, we’d never have ended up in the Everyman Cinema on Baker Street. And if we hadn’t gone to the Everyman my then six-year-old son, Oisín, would never have seen the trailer for Creed. He’d never have turned to us with wide-eyed amazement and announced: “That looks like the best film ever.” We could have left it there, and perhaps we’d have been better parents if we had. But instead we went home, dug out the old Rocky movies and Osh began a marathon viewing of the first four films, swiftly followed by Creed when it arrived online. I expected his excitement to dim. Like most six- year-olds he was prone to sudden enthusiasms – pirates, Furbies, football cards – which swiftly fade to be replaced by the next equally thrilling thing. But something about boxing took hold. And it wasn’t just the Rocky films. Muhammad Ali died and he lapped up the tributes to the Greatest. He watched documentaries on the best boxers and held enthusiastic conversations with his bemused older sister about whether Barry McGuigan was better than Prince Naseem. We would come downstairs at weekends and find him rewatching the end of Rocky 3 or cheering along with the climax of Creed. In a burst of fitness fervour my husband had bought himself a punchbag and hung it in the garage. Yet it was Osh who used it, sneaking in after school, trying on his father’s boxing gloves and swinging at the punchbag. He started telling everyone he was going to be a boxer – when a well-meaning father at school, who had some experience with the sport, pointed out that it’s not much fun being hit, my usually cheerful and polite son threw a water bottle at his feet and stormed off in a sulk. (He came back and apologised, but insisted he still wanted to learn the sport.) We were due to be in America when Osh turned seven and his talk was all of going to Philadelphia, running up the Rocky steps, and, most of all, getting into the ring. By now I was worried. This didn’t seem like a passing fad. Yet I really didn’t want my son to box, not now, not when he was older. My mind was full of serious injuries from concussion to brain bleed, from fractures of the skull to shattered eye sockets. But at the same time I wondered whether my resistance to the idea of him boxing was making me a hypocrite. For like Oisín, boxing once ruled my world. As a teenager AJ Liebling’s The Sweet Science fascinated me. I devoured non-fiction on the subject by Jimmy Breslin, Joyce Carol Oates, Hugh McIlvanney and Norman Mailer, and fiction by Dashiell Hammett, Damon Runyon and PG Wodehouse. I studied old footage of the fights between Marvin Hagler and Tommy Hearns and queued in New York in 1996 to catch Leon Gast’s superlative documentary When We Were Kings. If I never considered fighting myself, it’s only because 25 years ago it was an unheard of idea for a girl. So instead I did the next best thing. I became a boxing correspondent, first in New York for Daily News and then later in England for Sport First. I sat ringside covering fights from Prince Naseem v Kevin Kelley to Lennox Lewis’s bouts with Evander Holyfield, collected quotes for the Daily News’s irascible chief boxing writer Michael Katz and interviewed Joe Calzaghe and David Izon, who fought a memorable bout against Lou Savarese at the Harlem Apollo that saw the noisy audience yell for the famous hook to take the Bronx boxer away. Best of all I spent time with the Observer’s boxing correspondent Kevin Mitchell and the wonderful (and sadly gone) Irish boxing writer Harry Mullan, who was always gently encouraging of my chosen career at a time when women sports writers could not attend the British Boxing Writers’ Club Dinner regardless of how often they wrote about the sport. Towards the end of my time covering boxing I even interviewed a female boxer, Ali’s daughter Laila, who was just at the start of a career that would see her fight 24 times, winning them all. And I loved every minute. The tense feeling I’d get before the start of a bout, the pre-fight match-ups with their braggadocio and verbal jabs as well-placed as any punches in the ring, the way the best fights were half dance, half brawl. I loved the atmosphere of the New York gyms and the raw pride of the amateur bouts, in which impassioned families yelled their hearts out for fighters from all over the five boroughs. Frank Bruno once called boxing “the toughest and loneliest sport in the world”. He was right, but at its best it also feels like a club to which you’re lucky to belong. Given I remembered that thrill, did I have any right to deny it to my son? Is it really acceptable to praise boxers in print then turn around and tell Oisín that it wasn’t for him? In mitigation many professional boxers feel the same way – when I interviewed Laila Ali she admitted her father had been very unhappy that she’d chosen to box, while Lennox Lewis has said he would have “mixed feelings” about his son Landon boxing. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Canadian Paediatric Society recently put out a joint statement opposing children participating in boxing, noting: “Although boxing provides benefits for participants, including exercise, self-discipline and self-confidence, the sport of boxing encourages and rewards deliberate blows to the head and face. Because of the risk of head and facial injuries, [we] oppose boxing as a sport for children and adolescents.” At the end of last year the British Medical Association and brain injury charity Headway also condemned the sport after the death of 25-year-old Scottish boxer Mike Towell following a serious head injury sustained in a bout against Dale Evans. “As long as boxing is allowed to continue more and more young lives will be damaged or lost as a result of opponents deliberately trying to cause neurological harm to each other,” said Headway’s chief executive Peter McCabe. There is a huge difference between fighting professionally, as Towell did, and learning the rudiments, as Osh wants to. Yet even before the young boxer’s death I was uneasy. It felt like bad parenting to allow my child to box. On the other hand both he and his sister have played rugby since they were six, with Ruby, nine, moving up from tag to contact this year. “If you want to get your child concussed, let them play rugby or take up horse riding,” says Dr Mike Loosemore, who is the chief medical officer for England Boxing, the sport’s amateur wing. “You can sustain spinal fractures playing rugby or break your neck and back horse riding, but they’re also very middle class sports and therefore understood by doctors, many of whom have personal experience of them. Boxing by contrast tends to be misunderstood by those who have never spent any time with the sport, but simply condemn it outright.” Loosemore, who has worked for two decades examining concussion and brain injuries within the sport – research which lead to the recent decision to abandon head guards in amateur boxing “because they were shown to increase rather than prevent brain injuries” – stresses that boxing is highly regulated, particularly at the amateur level and says he would have no problem allowing a child of his to box. In the end I decide the only way to deal with my mixed feelings is to be honest. I tell Osh that I’m not keen on him boxing, but that while we’re in New York in the summer we can go to the city’s most famous gym, Gleason’s. It has had several locations since it was founded in the Bronx in 1937, but since 1984 it has been hidden in a once rundown but now prime location in Brooklyn’s Dumbo (Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass). Gleason’s is part of New York boxing legend. It’s where Jake LaMotta and Carlos Ortiz trained and where Ali prepared for his first fight against Sonny Liston, back when he was still called Cassius Clay. Barry McGuigan, Tommy Hearns and Larry Holmes are among those to have passed through its battered doors, as have actors from Robert De Niro to Wesley Snipes. These days Gleason’s also offers boxing classes for kids at the weekends. Taught by Michael “Coach Mike” Kozlowski, a Russian American who coached UK Olympic champion Luke Campbell to European Gold and won the 2012 Golden Gloves “Coach of the Year”, the classes aim to hit the sweet spot between fun and inspiring. “I don’t think there’s any problem with starting young,” says Kozlowski. “They’re not fighting in the ring, they’re training.” The classes are split by age and it’s certainly true that the youngest children are having a lot of fun, hopping across the room, working on their jabs, trying out the punch bags. “At that age it is about trying it out,” Kozlowski says. “But some of them stick with it. I have kids in this class who have been coming here for years, some move up and keep coming back to the gym. Some have real talent, others are here to sweat a bit and have fun.” Youth boxing is big news in America. Clubs across the US offer similar sessions to Gleason’s and children’s classes are becoming increasingly popular in the UK as well. Growing numbers of young women are getting involved, a factor that can possibly be attributed to the success of the charismatic Nicola Adams, who won gold medals in both London and Rio. Mark Collings, a boxing coach with the Limehouse Boxing Academy, agrees. “There’s definitely a feeling that the sport is more inclusive and has a more wholesome image than before,” he says. What does he attribute that to? “It’s partially the success of someone like Nicola, but it’s also that boxing clubs now offer a relatively well ordered and safe environment. In our club there are Bengali kids, Irish traveller kids, Romanians, Caribbeans, Africans… and that mix is a great benefit. Our club is one of the few places an Irish traveller kid would meet a Muslim kid and vice versa. That’s a great thing.” Danny Davis, who won the National Junior Development title last year at just 15, adds that one of the sport’s strongest selling points is the discipline it imbues in young fighters. “Before I started boxing I wasn’t that involved in school, but after I started boxing I started concentrating more.” Davis even credits the sport with improving his GCSE results. “It gives you a mindset where you learn how to trust yourself and hold your nerve and have a positive mentality.” So should I let go of my motherly fears and let Osh learn to box? Danny’s mother Kim admits she still struggles when her son gets in the ring. “It terrifies me in all truthfulness. When I first watched Danny I was shocked at how brutal it was even with these young kids. I was praying at the side of the ring, ‘Don’t let my son get hurt.’ Even now when he’s doing so well, I’m still full of nerves before every fight although I try not to let him see it. I have to keep reminding myself that he’s done the correct preparation and he has the skill and stamina to get through.” Did she ever think about trying to stop him? “So many people have said to me, ‘How could you let your son do that?’ but Danny was 12 when he decided to box and he went to the gym off his own back without telling us – it was his decision and I know how important choice is to teenagers, so I think that it’s my job as a parent to deal with that and support him. I say to myself I will deal with the fear as and when it happens because he’s living his dream and I do have so much pride in how well he’s done. The pride outweighs the fear.” Collings agrees that it’s not an easy decision to make. “Look, I’ve got a little girl and I’d be lying if I said I wanted her to take up boxing. But if your son stays interested, then there are some really positive things to take from boxing. It’s a great confidence booster, the club can be almost like a really weird extended family. There’s a lot of support. It also has enormous benefits just as an aerobic exercise – there’s a growing number of non-contact boxing schemes in schools which cater to those who want to keep fit.” The key phrase here is ‘stays interested’. “Officially the starting age is 11,” says Collings. “By that age you know your own mind. Start too young and you’d lose them – imagine being 19 and having already boxed for 10 years.” In other words it’s time for Oisín and I to compromise: if he still wants to box when he’s 11, he can try it. Until then it’s back to watching Adonis Creed on repeat.

Because I am working that day it was then pushed back to the start of February. Given the fact our fridge hasn’t worked for more than three months, we expected an earlier delivery date. CF, Saxtead Green, Suffolk Oh dear – it’s not great to have a faulty fridge in the run-up to Christmas. We have never been a fan of these warranty products, mostly because they can offer poor value for money. We contacted D&amp;G, which said you had originally made contact in mid-September to report a fault, but that the engineer it sent advised that the fridge would need to be replaced as the necessary part was no longer available. The initial delay was due to your replacement fridge being out of stock at all retailers. The company then offered you a higher specification fridge at a higher value, and agreed to cover the upgrade fee. It has since said it will also refund the delivery charge as a gesture of goodwill in light of the lengthy delay.

In terms of politics, there are certain key dates: 20 January, Donald Trump’s inauguration; ‘the end of March’, by which time Theresa May’s government is expected to trigger article 50 and the beginning of the Brexit process; 7 May 2017, by which time we should know if Marine Le Pen has managed to secure the French presidency. We asked our readers to make predictions for the year ahead. Some of these were optimistic and hopeful. Others were less so. Below, we present ten of the more interesting reader punts on how 2017 will unfold in their countries. As requested by the readers concerned, each view has been presented anonymously. Agree? Disagree? You can add predictions of your own in the comments thread below. 1) Brexit won’t happen Brexit will not happen. Process to become bogged down in negotiations in Europe, court cases, political debate at Westminister and regional governments. This will force a general election which will lead into a bitter coalition. The public will become even more apathetic. 2) It’ll be a bad year for Labour I think there will be a spring election and Labour will be seriously damaged with heavy losses. However, Jeremy Corbyn will refuse to resign triggering a deeper crisis for Labour. The Conservatives will secure a huge majority, but the picture will be mixed with the other parties. UKIP will gain a handful of seats. The Lib Dems will do well in university towns and cities. 3) We’ll see a continued rise in nationalism The twin forces of increased refugee emergencies and increased nationalist tendencies will continue. Violence and environmental degradation will push people toward richer, more developed nations who will in turn seek ways to limit how many “others” are allowed in. 4) Marine Le Pen will win - and trigger chaos I’m very concerned about the election of Marine Le Pen in France. She poses a significant threat to the stability of France and the wider world. We play at extremist politics in the UK, the Front National is a very scary prospect. 5) There’ll be a new coalition government in Germany We will have federal elections in upcoming September 2017 and the far-right party AfD is polling very high which angers and frightens me a lot. After 12 years in office, Angela Merkel seems vulnerable to me. I’m therefore rooting for a coalition change which favours my party the SPD in a strong coalition with The Greens and the Left in order to restore some sanity to the German political discourse and to dismantle the appeal of the AfD by introducing social policies which actually improve people’s lives and don’t put them in danger. 6) We’ll see significant progress in tackling climate change Despite Trump’s climate scepticism there will be a broad international push to combat climate change. This push will not just be political, but mostly from companies that will increasingly see the value of investing in sustainable energy 7) Trump to push the US towards isolationism Trump will very quickly alienate world leaders, including Putin, which will feel very scary. America will lose influence to the Chinese and Russians, who will gain significant momentum. 8) Turkey under Erdoğan will become increasingly authoritarian In Turkey, I expect to see further repression by Erdoğan, especially of the Kurds, curbing of free speech, a major break away from earlier ambitions to join the European Community and the growth of dissent among large numbers of the Turkish population. 9) Ireland will see an ugly abortion campaign Abortion will dominate the public discourse and an ugly campaign is coming. There is every likelihood that the FF-FG pact will collapse around some issue so an election is reasonably likely, depending on how well equipped both are to go to the polls. Brexit will also be front and centre for Ireland as we try to fight a hard border with the North and protect our exports to Britain. 10) Duterte will increase his grip on power In the Philippines, there will be an ongoing slaughter of poor people caught up in the drugs trade. Duterte wishes to impose his moral code on the people without providing resources to reduce poverty, improve education and increase jobs. He has total control of the media, armed forces and police.

Last week, soft pinkish light broke through early clouds hanging over Killybegs harbour, bouncing off the waters of the port and into the upstairs windows of the Bay View hotel. Tourists enjoying their breakfast looked down on fishing boats festooned with Christmas lights and bathed in unseasonally warm winter sunshine. It was moments like this that led National Geographic Traveller to conclude at the start of December that Donegal was the “coolest place on the planet” to visit. The magazine predicted big things for a county often overshadowed in tourist terms by better-known counties such as Kerry, and cities such as Dublin. “It’s a warm-hearted place, but wilderness always feels just a stone’s throw away,” said National Geographic Traveller’s UK editor, Pat Riddell. “And it is wilderness, world-class wilderness. We think it’s due a big year.” The global fame of Donegal had already been enhanced by the presence of the Star Wars cast shooting scenes for episode eight in the franchise, out in December last year. Inside the Bay View, general manager Tracey McGill said the “coolest place on the planet” epithet came as no surprise, but would help put the hotel, Killybegs and the entire county back on the tourist map: “National Geographic Traveller were telling us something we already knew here in Donegal!” The 35-year-old native of Ardara, a small town 10 miles to the north in this Irish-speaking region of south-west Donegal, said: “It’s going to be a great tool for us to market all of Donegal. Because we are so far up north, we often lose out to places like Kerry in the south-west. More foreign tourists go there than would come up here. This accolade will increase interest all over the world in what Donegal has to offer as well. “In my opinion it is all about the people. I really believe that we have more time for tourists and visitors compared with other places. We are already seeing an increase in interest in the Bay View since the article appeared, and we are hoping that when the season begins for real in March, there will be a big upsurge in visits.” The hotel itself is a symbol of Ireland’s economic recovery after a brutal recession that saw 15% unemployment and the country teetering on the edge of national bankruptcy. It had closed down but was rescued three years ago by a consortium of investors who include the father of Seamus Coleman, Republic of Ireland captain and Everton player. The footballer is widely admired in the town, and the county generally, for supporting local projects and promoting his native town. Coleman has retained a deep connection with Killybegs despite the riches and potential distractions of the English Premier League and international football stardom. “I know everyone loves where they’re from but I really do love Killybegs. I’m just Seamus, who they’ve known playing the Gaelic and kicking a football against the wall on St Cummins Hill, the housing estate I grew up on. This is peace and quiet, family and friends, and walks along Fintra beach. “It’s kids on the estate knocking on the door and asking me to come outside to play football with them and chatting about the Premier League. But no one here treats me like a Premier League footballer.” Ten miles west of Killybegs – on the Wild Atlantic Way, a coastal strip that runs for 1,600 miles along Ireland’s western seaboard – the narrow coast road passes homes where sheep wander into front gardens. There are stunning vistas of rugged, bucolic coastal inlets. In the sixth century, Irish monks sailed from here to take Christianity to Iceland. In the village of Carrick, Paddy Byrne runs a business ferrying tourists to the dramatic Slieve League cliffs – the largest of their kind in Europe. Standing by one of his boats, he said: “The ‘Coolest Place on the Planet’ thing will undoubtedly help bring more tourists. I had a call yesterday from a foreign tourist to see I could take them out to the cliffs, but I don’t get going until March. Yet the call shows you at least that the article has had some impact already.” But as he surveyed the spectacular scenery, with Slieve League mountain in the background and the quaint little harbour, Byrne also struck a cautious note. “This place may be beautiful but you can’t eat beauty. A lot of people, especially our young people, have to leave the county to get jobs, an education and opportunities.” Brexit is also a major concern. Donald Smyth, who used to work in the town’s fish processing factory, said that while boats in Killybegs are subject to strict EU quotas, British competitors freed of such restraints could inflict further damage on an already fragile fishing industry. The 67-year-old said: “Our boats are subjected to stringent tests to make sure they adhere to EU quotas, while foreign boats out there are no longer checked – especially with the Irish Naval Service away on duty in the Mediterranean Sea rescuing people and not around much any more on fishery protection. If British fisherman after Brexit can take as much fish from the Atlantic as they want, and don’t need to worry about EU quotas, then the fishing fleet here will be in even deeper trouble.” And while Donegal’s fishermen worry about how Brexit might give their British counterparts the edge, there are further worries over what will happen to the border with Northern Ireland when the UK leaves the EU. Pressure group Border Communities Against Brexit, formed to oppose the imposition of any frontier controls or passport checks on the 310-mile border that reaches from the north-west Atlantic coast near Derry and stretches across to the Irish Sea north of Dundalk. Its Donegal branch is headed by pharmacist Tom Murray, who points out that Donegal has borders with three counties in Northern Ireland – Derry, Fermanagh and Tyrone – so any disruption to cross-frontier trade could have a “devastating impact” on the county’s economy. There are also fears that a tourist boom could be detrimental to coastal beauty spots such as Carrick and nearby Teelin. “The tourist traffic is already increasing massively down in this corner of the county,” Byrne said. “I can cycle from the pier here up to Carrick in about 10 minutes but last summer by car it took me half an hour because of the traffic jams. We have to be very careful to preserve Donegal’s unspoilt, unclogged image even while we bring in more tourists.” Back in the Bay View hotel, McGill produced an Irish tricolour with the signature of Seamus Coleman scrawled across it. “It’s a signed flag that I only hand out to football-mad kids who stay in the hotel … and of course visiting Everton fans,” she said. “He did loads of them for me last time he was home.” As Donegal heads into a record-breaking tourist year, that kind of attention to detail will only enhance the reputation of a region on the rise. Donegal past and present ■ County Donegal, part of the ancient province of Ulster, encompasses 1,877 sq miles, and has a population of 158,755. ■ Ballyshannon in the south of Donegal is one of the oldest towns in Ireland, with archaeological sites dating from the Neolithic period (4000-2500BC). ■ Donegal’s Gaeltacht (Irish-speaking area) has a population of 24,744 – around 25% of Ireland’s Gaeltacht. ■ The Slieve League cliffs in Donegal are some of the highest sea cliffs in Europe. From the highest point, there’s a 2,000ft drop into the Atlantic Ocean – twice the height of the Eiffel Tower. ■ Donegal is home to Glenveagh, the second-largest national park in Ireland, with 35,000 acres of mountains, lakes and woodland, with Glenveagh Castle at its centre.','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/01/donegal-tourism-coolest-place-on-planet-national-geographic','‘Coolest place on planet’ accolade stirs interest in Ireland’s wild north',155,'world'),('global-development/2017/jan/01/development-short-stories-a-homesick-backpacker-uk-institute-of-development-studies','He’d been travelling for just over three months but this was his final destination before returning home. The thought made him nauseous. There was not much waiting for him there except the high expectations of parents, which he had no idea how to meet. Join the family business, put that degree to good use, make some money and marry a nice girl. No thanks – he thought. Not me, there must be something better. But backpacking his way across a region, supposedly rich with history and opportunity, had done little to shed new light on how to escape his depressingly predictable destiny. As he pondered his predicament, he became aware of someone calling him – “Ron, Ron!” – repeatedly until he finally snapped out of his daydream and turned to see his latest travelling companion, Kris, waving at him a few yards further up the busy street. “What is it?” he grumbled his reply. “You need to come here right now and check this out,” said Kris loudly, waving him over theatrically. People were glancing in his direction now. It was embarrassing. “Go on then, what is it?’ he snapped as he walked over – by now this country held few real surprises for him. Shitty food, people so hard to read, and the dreadfully embarrassing countrymen who seemed to pop up at every tourist attraction and guesthouse. “Look,” said Kris pointing, “even more beggars than we saw yesterday. Where do they all come from, for God’s sake?” Ron could see what he meant. There was a fairly big group of them, a dozen perhaps. They looked particularly incongruous in the city’s high-end shopping district. Dirty, and a little threatening, despite the kids they had with them. Babies on laps and filthy toddlers in badly fitting clothes. One of these children even had a Manchester United shirt on. It made Ron want to laugh at the absurdity of it all. They were hanging around by a bus stop with its garish corporate advertising, this one showing a perfect little family grinning as they ate some processed food out of bowls. Some of the beggars just chatted but others sat and stared intently at the passing crowd. They had a sign with them – words scrawled on a battered piece of cardboard. Ron could not make out what was written and did not want to stare too long. These people always targeted the foreigners. He was sick of it. “Sad, eh?” said Kris. “I mean, surely when you have a load of rich folk or whatever marching about spending a fortune in all these shops, driving nice cars, you shouldn’t still have poverty like this.” “I suppose, but it’s been the same everywhere. What do you expect?” answered Ron. “And anyway they’re refugees, aren’t they? Come on, this is the main shopping area. We came here to get geared up – what is it you’re looking for?” “Oh, I don’t know – not much good at shopping.” Kris shrugged. “What’s this place good for?” “Clothes, I would imagine,” answered Ron. “I might get some music or something.” Kris laughed loudly and some of the locals stared. “Music! For goodness sake, who buys music in a shop? Even here! Just download it.” Ron felt humiliated so lashed out. “I suppose you’ll just want to buy something for that girlfriend of yours?” He knew all too well that Kris was on the rebound. Kris just glowered and showed him the finger. “Very mature,” Ron muttered. In the end the two decided to part company and do their own thing for a while. Ron felt relieved. You travel halfway round the world feeling a little lonely and homesick, then you meet someone from your own country who seems to be from a similar background, hang out – and then quickly discover being with them 24/7 is unbearable. He’d never been concerned about travelling on his own; you meet more people that way, he’d told his worried-looking mother, but he had not reckoned on most of them being clowns. As he made his way up the street, the crowds seemed to get thicker and thicker. They jostled past him, but he was used to that. He cut his way through but somehow everyone seemed to walk with a purpose, whereas he ambled along and, now and again, changed direction as something caught his eye. This seemed to cause confusion. No one met his gaze, but he was occasionally pushed and shoved and at one point he had his foot painfully stepped on. He had been told this was the spot in the city for shopping but he was still amazed at how busy it was, despite all that he had heard about the increasingly desperate economic situation. Everyone just seems to shop, he thought to himself. Perhaps it makes them feel better? There were of course many foreign faces like his own; most seemed to stride along with a purpose, like they knew exactly where they were going. He turned into a small side street to catch his breath. As he made his way down the narrow lane he found himself outside some sort of textiles shop and decided to step inside to get even further away from the hubbub. The small boutique was pleasantly calm inside but he was almost immediately approached by a pushy salesman. “What is it you are looking for, sir?” he asked, a forced smile on his face. Why couldn’t they just leave him alone? He was sure he was being overcharged wherever he went because of the colour of his skin, and he certainly had bought several items he did not need and did not really have room for in his luggage. “Well, er, hmm, you know – just looking for something for my mother.” The words came out before he’d really decided how he was going to respond. It was true, he did need a gift for Mum but what on earth was this place going to provide? It was hardly a souvenir shop. There were plenty of textile shops at home. But the salesman was off, pointing things out and encouraging Ron to rub various materials between his fingers, make admiring noises about the colours. After what felt like an hour but was actually 10 minutes, he finally escaped complete with a red pashmina, gift-wrapped. At least it would not take up much room in his bag. Feeling slightly embarrassed by his purchase, and his inability to manage even the nicest and most gently spoken shop people, he quickly made his way further down the backstreets, following several twists and turns. It was not until he was pulling his phone from his pocket to call Kris to find where they were meeting for lunch, as per an earlier plan, that he realised his surroundings looked entirely unfamiliar. Surely he could not have strayed that far from the main shopping precinct? Damn it, he thought. Lost again. Ron’s ability to get lost was almost legendary. At school he was subject to much teasing from the other boys for being clueless when it came to navigating the busy city in which he spent his entire childhood. “Hey man – lost again, ha ha!” they’d call out, if he was ever late for class, before the teacher quietened them down and ordered him, shamefaced, to his seat. Now, at the age of 23, he was still teased by friends, girlfriends and family about his lack of any sense of direction. His father had humiliated him in front of his aunties and uncles, brothers and sisters and all those that had gathered to see him off back in the spring, by presenting him with a map and a compass. “To help you find your way, son,” he laughed, and everyone joined in mocking him. Some even clapped. “Just follow all the other people who look like you,” shouted his older brother, laughing. He blushed at the memory. A first-class computer science graduate and they just sodding laughed. He fumed when he thought about it. The street he found himself in looked quite depressing on this grey overcast day, and the sidewalk was littered with filth – uncollected rubbish, broken glass and dog mess. He looked properly at his surroundings. Boarded-up shopfronts, dwellings with grimy windows and scruffy front entrances, overgrown with weeds. Where the hell was he? This did not look like the city centre. He stared at his mobile phone. Oh great, he thought. No signal – again. Why was he not surprised? Either his phone was out of charge or the signal had gone. No Google maps then, he grimaced. He was reminded yet again of the joke map his father had presented to him. It was not even of the right bloody country, never mind the right city. He was so busy thinking about whether he could retrace his steps, while still brooding over his humiliation back home, that he did not see the two men approaching him from behind. The first he knew about their presence was when one grabbed him by the shoulder and spun him around. The other shouted, “OK, we’ll have that!” The phone was snatched from his hand. “You rich foreigners don’t need it anyway. You can just buy another.” Both were young – perhaps in their late teens – and one, to Ron’s horror, carried an ugly-looking little blade. Ron felt his guts lurch and bile rising in his throat. “Money!” barked the taller of the two, while his knife-carrying colleague looked nervously about. Ron did not speak, just handed over his money and cards. His hand shook as he held them out and they were snatched from him. And then the men were gone. They had fled around the corner so fast he hardly saw them go. Afterwards, he struggled to remember what they had been wearing or their faces. They all looked the same to him anyway. He remembered the glint of the knife, though, and the thick accent of the taller one who spoke. Those memories visited him in his dreams for a long time afterwards. It was not until after the meeting with the bored-looking police officer, a woman, the successful attempt to reach his distraught parents and, on the following day, the wiring of money and the purchase of a cheap phone, that Ron was able to get his stuff together for the trip home. As for Kris – well, he lost his number along with his iPhone, and he never saw him back at the accommodation. He was a loser anyway, and it was not as if he ever tried to contact Ron again. It was later that evening, while he packed, that he found the pashmina under his bed. It was still in its carefully folded paper gift wrapping, in the bottom of a crumpled plastic shopping bag with little white handles and the store’s logo printed on the side. He’d clutched that bag right through the robbery. He had not even noticed he was carrying it and his assailants also seemed to have ignored it. Funny really, he thought. Then he burst into tears, sitting down heavily on the side of his hotel bed, putting his head in his hands. The shock of what had happened to him the day before finally hit him. God, he missed home so much. This country had overwhelmed him, with its crass commercialism, bizarre cultures and behaviours, and its misplaced arrogance – particularly towards foreigners. He just wanted to get away. He did not care if it was steeped in shared history and was great for your Christmas shopping. Surely, all the hype around it was misplaced. Why did so many come here – even stay? It was beyond him. Twelve hours later, he was heaving his rucksack through the airport, casting his gaze from left to right toward the other side of the arrivals gate to see if he could spot his father’s driver. There he was. Good. Right on time. The heat, noise and smells of home hit him as they left the terminal together. As he sat in the back seat staring out at all the familiar sights he felt depressed once again. What the hell was he going to do? His trip really had changed nothing. Three countries visited, many new experiences notched up, and for what? Maybe his parents were right. All this backpacking, pretending you are poor, when really you could go and dine in the finest restaurant, check into a five-star hotel, or just fly home whenever you wanted, really was a waste of time. Worse, it was a lie. They were now in the city centre, passing the columns and glass of the railway station, less than a mile from his parents’ apartment. The car ground to a halt yet again. The traffic certainly had not improved since he’d left. “What’s the hold-up now, Gopal?” he asked the driver. “Very sorry, Mr Rahul, sir. There is a cow at the top of the street holding everything up.” Ron stared into Paharganj – now there is a crowded neighbourhood, he thought. He could see many western tourists strolling up and down and being hassled by hawkers and beggars. God, the last few times he had been down there were when he and his school friends used to go and buy fireworks for Diwali. Bloody dreadful place. What made people leave their own comfortable homes to visit such shitholes? He tried to remember the phrase he heard his father use despairingly once, when describing these young visitors to his country. What was it? “Development tourists,” that was it. What a joke. “Just drive around, Gopal,” he instructed the driver. The car slowly edged forward, horns blaring all around. No place like home, he thought. He stared out of the window watching the sun turning orange on the hazy, polluted New Delhi skyline.

So press “play” and we are box set ready to go. But what happens if by episode three the tension has fallen away and all the untied plot strands dangle annoyingly? According to one leading British writer, this is now the fate of too many television dramas as the demand for fresh entertainment cranks up. Chris Lang, the creator of ITV’s returning “cold case” detective series Unforgotten, has questioned a commissioning culture that can oblige writers to deliver at breakneck speed to feed the beast of box-set production. In an interview with the Observer, Lang said: “You can definitely spot the shows where the writers clearly didn’t quite know where it was going to end. It happens particularly in longer shows, with six episodes or more. You can see when they had no idea, and then they often leave it hanging, hoping to get a second series.” Lang, who also scripted Sirens, Torn, Undeniable and A Mother’s Son, is one of the British writers who have benefited from the great boom in television drama over the last five years. He acknowledges the best shows have high standards, but argues no drama series should go into production before the creative team has thought their story through. “Having it sorted in advance is incredibly important,” he said. “We are all enjoying this golden age of television drama but you would not believe how many shows start preproduction with only two or three scripts ready. The writers are still writing as they start filming. To me that is an absolutely insane way to work.” British production companies have realised that hit dramas are vital to their survival. Broadcast magazine’s latest annual survey of independent programme makers found that revenues at the top five companies making drama (Carnival, the maker of Downton Abbey and Whitechapel; Left Bank, the maker of The Crown; Kudos, which makes Humans; Bentley, Midsomer Murders; and Neal Street, Call the Midwife) are all up more than 30% on last year. Meanwhile, subscription broadcasters such as Sky, Netflix and Amazon are investing heavily in drama, alongside the traditional terrestrial channels. As the golden age of the box set enters its second phase, there are murmurings from writers’ rooms in Britain and America. If audiences want hit series that will truly entertain them, there must be enough time to create them. Although Lang has co-written a new show, Innocent, with thriller novelist MJ Arlidge, he usually writes alone. He admires the distinctive tone of Sally Wainwright, creator of Happy Valley and Last Tango in Halifax, and of the Catastrophe co-writer Sharon Horgan. He also enjoys US shows such as The Affair, which stars British actors Ruth Wilson and Dominic West, and Divorce, which is also by Horgan and stars Sarah Jessica Parker. “It is the little flourishes in these scripts that make them feel real and truthful,” Lang said. “And sadly these are the first casualties when time is short and the plot has to take precedence.” Lang said his work is usually complete before production. “Why would you not do it like that? You have got 60 or 70 people waiting for you, not including the actors, and they need to set up a shooting schedule. If you have it all done they can schedule it in blocks, which means you can save money and then spend it in the right way, making the show look fantastic.” His new series of Unforgotten starts on Thursday (9pm, ITV) with the discovery of a body in a sealed suitcase in London’s river Lea. The detective duo played by Nicola Walker and Sanjeev Bhaskar then have to trace back the story, drawing in four apparently unconnected suspects. “If you are half-good at your job, you should have a vision and absolutely know where it is ending,” said Lang. Neal Street’s Dame Pippa Harris agreed that producers prefer a finished script so that budgets can be spent wisely. “When we made Penny Dreadful for Sky, it was a huge advantage that John Logan had written the entire first series before we began,” she said. “But ultimately it depends on the writer, and some people produce their best work under the pressure of production. I remember that when we greenlit Paul Abbott’s State of Play at the BBC, he had only written the opening episodes and had no clear outline for where it was going. Likewise, Jez Butterworth, who I’ve been working with recently on Britannia for Sky, has relished the freedom of altering storylines and character arcs in later episodes.” The first great golden age of television was in the 1950s and 60s, when limited channel choices meant that a few shows achieved cultural dominance. Writers tended to stick to the same shows and with the same on-screen talent. Now, with hundreds of scripted television shows on air in a year, it is impossible for quality to be widespread. Writers are more often freelancers, who must keep several plates spinning. Notwithstanding his reservations, Lang, who writes at least 10 drafts of each of his scripts, emphasises that he is “rejoicing with my fellow writers at how ascendant television is. I can’t remember a time when there was so much good stuff on.”','https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/01/box-set-tv-binge-culture-chris-lang-unforgotten','Box-set binge culture ‘forces TV channels to put out half-baked programmes’',157,'tv-and-radio'),('business/2017/jan/01/brexit-slow-burning-fuse-powder-keg-in-2017','This is the year when our politicians and the so-called “people” – all 28% of the population who voted to leave the European Union – will reap what they have sown. Unfortunately, unless sense prevails, the rest of us will also suffer the product of their wild oats. The absurdity, indeed perils, of Brexit become more obvious by the month. Business is nervous; so is the City, which constitutes far more hundreds of thousands of employees than the small, avaricious band of bankers who made their notorious contribution to the financial crisis. It would be good if the majority of members of parliament could recall and act upon Edmund Burke’s 1774 address to the electors of Bristol: they should summon up the courage to act as representatives, not delegates of constituencies where they fear the threat from the xenophobic forces conjured up by the likes of Nigel Farage (who shamelessly continues to draw a handsome salary from an EU institution he affects to abhor). They should capitalise on the increasing signs of nervousness and potential panic among the leading Brexiters. For the diehard Liam Fox to decide that perhaps, after all, we should remain in the customs union was rather interesting. The personal attacks by parliamentary Brexiters on our ambassador to the European Union, Sir Ivan Rogers, were indicative of panic in the victorious ranks. The occasion was the leaking of advice given to Theresa May, in which Rogers suggested trade renegotiations with the EU could last 10 years. This revelation provoked an unpleasant ad hominem attack on a distinguished civil servant who, in the best traditions of Whitehall, “tells it like it is” to the occupant of No 10, whether that be David Cameron or Theresa May. The plain, hard fact of the matter, which the Brexiters refuse to grasp, is that the other 27 members of the EU were desperate for us to vote to Remain, but were never going to roll over to the Brexiters’ proposals for a swift offer to this country to “have its cake and eat it”. Here we come to an interesting historical development. Rogers, while now occupying a vitally important post at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, is himself essentially a Treasury man. And the Treasury, unlike the Foreign Office, has traditionally been suspicious of the European Union. But Rogers knows which side this country’s bread is buttered, and neither our diplomatic nor economic interest is likely to be served by Brexit. In which context, I was especially struck by the way a former Treasury official, who in days gone by was persistently vitriolic in his comments on the EU, recently contacted me to ask whether the nation had lost its senses. The problem at the moment is that the damage caused by the referendum is on a slow-burning fuse. There are time lags in these matters: the impact on prices and real earnings from the collapse of the pound will become more evident as the year progresses. As it becomes clear that the Brexiters who have captured the prime minister do not have a convincing strategy, plans for major firms to relocate their investments to continental Europe will gradually be implemented. Meanwhile I have also been struck by the number of people who have contacted me to express astonishment at the Boxing Day intervention of Mervyn King, Mark Carney’s predecessor as governor of the Bank of England. Lord King has come out as a Brexiter, which is not very helpful to his successor, who can sense a prospective train crash and was quite right to warn about the impact on the pound of a Leave vote – and who, with the help of his colleagues at the Bank, has been doing his best to keep the show on the road since. But King has long been a Eurosceptic – not just about the eurozone, on which issue I share his concerns, but also about the European Union itself. Personally, I think Brexiters such as King underestimate the damage not only to our trade from Brexit, but also the extent of the sacrifice of our potential contribution to the future of the EU in a troubled world. However, I note even King concedes that Brexit will not be a bed of roses. He was, of course, speaking to the BBC’s Today programme, which ever since the beginning of the referendum campaign seems to have gone out of its way to give prominence to Monsieur Farage and his ilk. They were at it again last week, with the shameless Michael Gove heavily revising his castigation of “experts”, seemingly narrowing the field of the accused to the category of economic forecasters. Well, forecasters do their best. But economists probably regret the way that their noble trade has been associated too much in the public mind with forecasting, as opposed to fundamental economic analysis. Anyway, while wishing readers as happy a new year as events allow, I should like to end with this wonderful quote from Jan Kamieniecki in a letter to the Financial Times: “I suspect that what Michael Gove meant to say was that the people in this country have had enough of exports.”','https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/01/brexit-slow-burning-fuse-powder-keg-in-2017','Brexit’s slow-burning fuse will reach a powder keg this year',158,'business'),('travel/2017/jan/01/25-of-the-best-yoga-holidays-and-retreats','You can’t move for downward dog opportunities these days. The explosion of yoga in western countries means there’s a studio on every other street and such a variety of styles and options, that choosing a holiday or retreat can be overwhelming. So where to start? It makes sense to try a weekend away before committing to a whole week. One possibility is to choose a teacher you know or like the sound of and see if they’re running anything that suits. Or you could pick a venue you fancy and see what teachers are hosting holidays there. Think about what you want too – some combine yoga with other activities (maybe good for those with non-yogi partners), some are vegan, some don’t ban booze – it’s always worth asking before you book. Most retreats will cater for all levels, with teachers listening to individual needs, but I’ve marked those particularly for beginners suitable with a B.

Fifteen years ago, Britain devoured around 15m newspapers each morning. Now it’s 6m and falling. Meanwhile digital consumption/addiction accelerates away and social media dominate reading time and attention. One habit dies; another takes over. That’s an obvious tale of cause and effect, a conclusion that broadcasters who don’t much appreciate the printed press find an easy recitation. One habit falls, another takes over. An equation so basic you don’t really have to think about it – nor try to set it in any historical context. But look back awhile before you look forward. For looking forward means looking back. History has a way of answering questions – and my history in print began almost six decades ago at the Witney Press, 12 miles from Oxford. There, twice a week, academic ambitions pushed conveniently well to one side, some of us brought out the university paper Cherwell. And there, too, we registered the hard, creaky truths about newspaper production: an old, thumping flatbed press down below, a composing room that shook as the first copies emerged, and three men who knew the ropes. Bill sat at the Linotype keyboard and set every word; George was head printer and head of everything; and then there was Trembly Charlie, who had a disconcerting habit of scattering lead slugs all over the floor as deadlines neared. So I learned many things at the double. How to write stories that cut from the bottom. How to find extra space when tales wound up short. How to rummage in the big box of ancient wood type when you needed a headline bigger than 48 point. (We had a scoop about a planned highway through Magdalen meadows – but the only letters left that made any Countdown-style sense proclaimed nothing beyond “THE ROAD”. OK, print it.). How not to panic or lose your temper. How to be very nice to Charlie when his hand started shaking again. That was all good stuff, two years later, stoning in the women’s page at the Liverpool Daily Post. Even better stuff, seven years on, in the composing room at the Guardian in Gray’s Inn Road where – one early miracle of new technology – teletype setting (aka TTS) delivered more sticks of lead bearing only a vague approximation of the copy pumped down the line from a threatened but still fully staffed Manchester office. Were there better ways of finding the future? Alastair Hetherington, my editor, perhaps more interested in cabinet politics than printing systems, sent me on a tour of the US to report. I found a glorious newsroom at the Miami Herald, a faded pink paradise, huge picture windows overlooking a blue lagoon, which was pioneering optical character reading, OCR. But it worked slightly less well than our own TTS. Another one bit the dust. I sat in the newsroom of the Boston Globe, a computer on every desk – except in the editor’s office, where newfangled devices weren’t welcome. I went to Massachusetts as Atex became a name to conjure with and saw computer keyboards begin to replace typewriters (except at the Guardian, where the National Graphical Association insisted on having their stalwarts retrained on qwerty boards so that their rights to double key-stroking remained briefly inviolate). Then I watched silently as, at last, the final remnants of hot metal were carried coffin fashion across the composing room floor, a way of life beaten out in traditional manner. I was there as journalists could at last set the paper themselves and lay it out on screen. I was around, and bailing desperately, when the IRA blew up our brand new Isle of Dogs print site. And all of this, one crisis after another, one false dawn after another, seemed to promise some publishing nirvana just around the corner. An era where the ancestral cry of the overseer as chapel meetings dragged on would be no more. “Oh Mr Preston, the pots have gone cold!”. (No hot metal for 30 minutes.) A world where communication – from editor to reader – was instantaneous rather than lugubrious. A world where editions flowed seamlessly, where pages could be changed in a trice: a world where putting the news out on paper was a pleasure, not an obstacle race. You could feel that print nirvana coming in the late 1980s and through the 1990s. New papers, new supplements, new thicker editions, the transforming wonders of colour – and the cost of the print union legions fading away as they left to find a new life for themselves. (Wapping had delivered a moment of history as well as much bitterness.) But, of course, progress has a way of tripping over its own shoelaces, so the full magic of profit and reduced costs never quite happened. More of everything on many more pages meant more competition, which meant more marketing budgets. And then there was the beginning of the internet, a true new frontier. Was it a revolution or merely another string to a newsroom’s bow? Core or peripheral? Small offices, and then much bigger offices, were needed to house a growing digital staff. Some newspapers – the Telegraph, the Guardian – thought they saw the point fast and developed theories of parallel, integrated production. Some – even the Daily Mail – watched and waited. Few quite predicted what would happen next. But soon it wasn’t – as mostly it remains – a question of either digital news or print news. Soon, ominously, the answer was clearly both: a daily paper produced on ever thinner resources, a digital posting in need of constant rewriting and re-editing. Could the staff who served online and print be truly integrated so that one team covered both? The Telegraph produced its giant wheel of a newsroom, one function lapping into another. Other papers invented even more complex copy and picture flows. Yet there was, and still isn’t, any clear resolution. Staffing increased inexorably in any case. Technical reinforcements were essential at every stage. More programs needed more programmers. Tablets followed laptops as the device of choice – except that, as Rupert Murdoch discovered after he’d spent millions launching The Daily, tablets were merely one more excuse for devising digital editions and tweaking them hour after hour. No. Obviously, it seemed, the basic answer would have to be different: smartphones in the wake of the iPhone, extra Apple and Android versions, material reprocessed to fit different-sized screens, and prospectively benefiting from the incontrovertible fact that users, especially young people, were used to paying to use their mobile phones. Here was the magic viability of feet firm on profitable ground – except that it didn’t work out that way. There was, as it transpired, too much free news material out there you didn’t have to pay for. To this day, only about 10% of news on the net comes with a price tag. The central competition, therefore, had to be scrabbling for advertising riches to match the exponential growth figures as smartphones left tablets and laptops in the shade. Enter Netflix, Amazon and a host of streaming options. Enter an overwhelming demand for more video, together with ever more complex methods of measuring reader “engagement”. Enter a fresh array of web-only contenders fuelled with start-up investment. And, suddenly, there was no salvation in subscription formulas. The demand now is for more free – but more free in any every sense as ad-blocking cuts revenues sharply and digital advertising to news-oriented sites stalls, leaving all those extra staff and all those investment hopes looking a trifle bereft. More, this is a general phenomenon on the new side of the fence. It isn’t just newspaper sites that face a challenge. BuzzFeed and other wunderkinds have to pause and ponder their profit forecasts. The Huffington Post runs out of Huff and puff. The Gawker has pulled the chain on its own legend. Only Facebook, Google and Snapchat stand tall for the moment, hoovering up ad money and leaving precious little for the rest. So those 60 years of personal history begin to weigh heavy again. It’s natural to decide that life’s shifts are permanent as one steady state supplants another. The future has arrived, and there’s no need to ponder any more. Think Concorde, the new, supersonic manifestation of travel. Think manned space adventure. And, diminuendo, think newsprint perishing like the wrapping of fish and chips while digital communication inherits the Earth. But who, pray, deemed history moribund, like the print it supposedly consigns to the waste bin? Who decided that a story which has altered course so many times in my lifetime was now dead and buried? One spectacular crash, one daunting energy crisis, and Concorde itself was history. We didn’t need to go faster after all. The difficulty with history’s familiar progress shtick is that, to reach a simple, seemingly stable conclusion, you have to stop the clock and declare the entire race over, completely run. But we all ought to know by now that this is a marathon course without a finishing line. An article, or, frankly, a book, which proclaims print closure is mere extrapolation, not conclusion: as that personal history tour of mine rams home. The future changed when they bought a rotary press in Witney. The future changed when the Liverpool Daily Post gave birth to Trinity Mirror – and changed again when the Guardian seemed to leave Manchester for good. Was it Eddie Shah and Today? Or the saintly Andreas and his Independent? Is the future free or nestling behind a paywall? For that matter, has any non-specialist news provider found a stable foundation that guarantees survival 10 or 20 years hence? The point about looking back is that this unwinding chronicle never ends, never finds a steady state. There’s a whole new world beyond Facebook and Google out there – and only one certainty firm in the mix. However produced, however delivered, this swirling world needs facts, perceptions, arguments, reflections, hard truths. This world needs journalism.

How Can Journalism Survive the Decline of Print? edited by John Mair, Tor Clark, Neil Fowler, Raymond Snoddy and Richard Tait and published this month by Abramis (£19.95).

My aim is to at least double that distance within a month. The method An expensive pair of sunglasses. The Oakley Radar Pace glasses look like any upmarket sports eyewear – sleek and futuristic – but with the novel twist of a voice-activated coaching system. They are adorned with removable earphones, three microphones and a clutch of internal sensors for real-time updates on your run or bike ride. These are delivered, Siri-like, with the vocal prompt “OK, Radar”. The sunglasses are paired with an app on which you can customise a training plan based on your fitness levels. I chose the beginner setting, opting for some extra focus on improving my endurance. There are two other programmes available – speed and maintenance. And so my first session begins with a stilted exchange. “OK, Radar,” I say, “what’s my workout plan for today?” Radar tells me I am to do a four-minute warm-up followed by an easy 1.5-mile run. Radar doesn’t give me any specific warm-up advice, so I improvise some stretches. And then we’re off. The verdict During each run I received regular updates on my pace, power, stride length and more. This abundance of data lends itself to a kind of gamification as you’re encouraged to log it all on the app and beat your previous record. The glasses were comfortably light and ergonomic, with minimal sliding or shaking as I thudded along the pavement. The only notable discomfort was my self-consciousness as I ran through busy parks while breathlessly exclaiming “how long left?” like a 2016 doomsayer. The draw here is the technology’s flexibility and responsiveness: I was caught off-guard at one point when a curt voice told me to “use shorter, quicker steps as you run”. The personalised planner is easy to use and surprisingly motivational. Whenever I missed a session, it was promptly rescheduled to a later date – no flaking out allowed. Motivation is important, I found, when you take up running in December. Of course, the price tag will deter casual joggers like me, and the lenses aren’t available in prescription form, which seems a shame. But for the distance-running dataphiles of this world – who are the real target audience here, after all – they’ll go down well. There’s an array of nerdy features to play with: my favourite was taking phone calls wirelessly from my pocket. You can also play music through the earphones and link the glasses to other devices such as heart-rate monitors or foot pods. Given that most activity is tied to your mobile, the specs aren’t the most “wearable” of wearable technologies. But after being guilt-tripped by my coach for a couple of weeks, and once I’d become used to the relentless pain in my legs, my new routine became almost enjoyable. I even managed to crawl to my four-mile goal – without retching, I can report – and I might just continue into the new year. Alfie Packham Roli Lightpad Block, £169.95 The goal The goal, says my editor, is for me to create my first single. “Single!” I laugh to myself. “How out of date!” I resolve to make a track instead, perhaps one that involves loops and beats. Maybe a few squelchy acid noises. Yodelling (optional). That kind of thing. Whether I can do it is another question. Anyone who listens to music a lot understands that making music is difficult. Even if your approach is “no talent DIY” – which, of necessity, mine will be – you either need mad innocence or mad bravery to create tunes that sound good, and I haven’t been innocent or brave for many years. The method A new instrument that looks like a muscle-bound drinks coaster. Meet the Roli Lightpad Block, and its companions the half-sized Loop Block and Live Block. This little system is made by the same company that invented the tech-piano Seaboard, which won many awards. I like the way the Blocks look: they’re perfectly pocketable and nice to click together. When I first get them, in packaging very similar to Apple’s (at the moment, you can only get Roli Blocks to work with iOS), my kids are excited: they think the Rolis are new phones. Once they get over their mild disappointment, we get the Lightpad up and flashing, and connect to the free Noise app. And we start enjoying ourselves, making sounds by stroking and poking and sliding our fingers around the Lightpad. It has a series of square LED lights – think 1980s disco dancefloor – that you can play, and the Noise app, which visually mirrors the Lightpad, has an interesting collection of sounds, including Trap Drum, Old-School House Bass and Moraz Lead (Jean-Michel Jarre, essentially,). The big deal about the Lightpad is how it responds to your touch: supposedly it can recognise how as well as where you touch it, which means you can use your fingers to express a mood. This was the USP of the Seaboard, too: the idea that you can get a piece of tech-ery to respond to you playing it with feeling. It’s a nice idea. Swirl your finger quickly around the pad for one type of sound, prod it for another. Unfortunately, for an amateur like me, this doesn’t really work. Every time I get a sound I like on the Lightpad, and try to record it as a loop, I can’t repeat it exactly. It makes me feel hamfisted, rather than piano-fingered. The two extra blocks replicate the functions on the Noise app. You don’t really need them. And actually, as the Lightpad itself makes no sound at all, you don’t really need it either. The sound comes out of your phone. In fact, we soon discover that you can do everything the Roli Blocks offer on the Noise app. The blocks are just add-ons. Am I missing something? I don’t quite see the point of this. Especially as my iPhone screen proves to be more touch-responsive than the Lightpad. I persevere, but keep forgetting to charge up the Lightpad. It goes back in the drawer, and we play on the Noise app instead. But that, too, becomes limited after a while. There are a lot of sound options, but only four drum tracks, oddly. Plus, the recording is really irritating. I try to record more than one sound over each other (overdubbing, get me) and the app won’t do it. And there is no way of recording anything outside the app, such as your voice, or an actual real-life instrument. YouTube offers up a few professional musicians who appear to enjoy the Roli Blocks. And there are others, including RZA and Grimes, who have been signed up to promote Roli. I notice, though, that unless they’re playing live, the musicians often combine them with their existing studio set-up. Amateurs like me are left stabbing frustratedly at their phone, and, really, who needs a soundtrack for that? In my head, I’ve already got a sarcastic tuba player parping along. (He’s always there.) The verdict The Roli Lightpad costs £170. If you buy everything you’re meant to (two Lightpads, plus Loops and Live), you’ll spend almost £500. Very expensive for a setup that has nice aspects – it fits into your pocket, it clicks together, it’s instinctive, it’s pretty – but is locked into Apple. You can only share your recorded musical efforts via the Noise app, not on to SoundCloud. As a musical device, the Blocks work much better for live messing about than they do as a recording device. And even then, if you were a musician, you’d probably have more fun if you combined them with something else, like a microphone. The Noise app is a laugh, though. Try that. Miranda Sawyer TRX Home Gym, £149 The goal I was never sure what core strength was. Then my fiance had a skateboarding accident, slipped a disc and spent months on painkillers before an enlightened GP balked at his repeat prescription and recommended core strength training instead. In support, I vowed to join him yet have failed to maintain my side of the bargain, which requires me to actually turn up to the gym, not just sign up to it. The TRX Home Gym promises to help you build your core “anywhere, anytime”. Could this be the answer? The method The TRX training kit consists of two adjustable straps, joined for suspension at one end, with handles at the other – apparently simple stuff that engages multiple muscle groups as you leverage gravity and your body weight to row, lunge, lean, push and pull. I started sceptical – it’s just a couple of straps! – but took it all back by day three as my muscles started to ache. To use the TRX at home, I envisaged needing to bolt something either side of a door frame or screw a big hook into the wall. In fact, it comes with a padded attachment that anchors it either side of a closed door and a separate strap if you want to go outside. Bar the occasional chilly trip to the balcony, I used it inside. It may be an ingenious design, but I wasn’t so sure about our door frames, which I was convinced would collapse in on me like a scene from a Buster Keaton film. As well as videos guiding you through each exercise, the TRX app provides curated workouts spanning anything from 10 to 30 minutes (add 50% extra time if you’re a beginner), all synced to the beat of whatever gems are lurking in your iTunes account – in my case, very few as it turned out. The verdict The TRX website promises the home gym suspension trainer “allows you to finally find the better you!”. What does that even mean? Marketing slogans like that are my only real gripes though. I’m amazed how much stronger I feel having added less than half an hour (once I got the hang of it) of exercise to my day. The kit’s major upsides are how quick it is to assemble, how easy it is to transport and how simple it is to store. In fact, if I’m not taking it with me I just leave mine slung over the bedroom door now, ready for the morning – it’s harder to walk past than it was to ignore the gym. There were several exercises I couldn’t do, but that gives me something to work on – I wonder what happens when you’re a pro at all of them? Hopefully it doesn’t lose its appeal at that point. The hardest thing I managed was an atomic pushup, which combines alternating pushups (your feet are hooked into the lowered TRX handles) with crunching your knees towards your chest. You’re so busy steading yourself, maintaining momentum and ensuring you can get back up that you don’t realise how much work you’re doing… until you collapse. Don’t be fooled into thinking that won’t happen to you too. Without the app, which you can use to track your progress, I wouldn’t have had a clue what to do. Even with it, I have no doubt there’s much room for improvement. Are my feet in the right place? Do my elbows stick out? A personal trainer would be able to guide you on this; doing it on your own requires a bit of faith, alongside a few repeat watches of the instruction videos. With an increasing volume of research highlighting the importance of exercise to counteract the negative health impacts of sedentary lifestyles, though, I don’t care if I’m not always doing it exactly right. At least it beats going to the gym. Tess Riley S+ Sleep Monitor, £129.95 The goal So simple and so elusive – a good night’s sleep. I’ve been a bad sleeper all my life. It may even run in the family. My grandmother put together an anthology for insomniacs and used to give me tips on how to get through long, sleepless nights without panicking and making the day to come even worse. It hasn’t been made any better by a job as a foreign correspondent, which involves constant travel, irregular and often unfriendly hours; often, I’m up at 3am for a dawn flight, working long into the night then racing home. The stories I collect and people I meet often linger in my mind long after I have finished writing. So I’m always looking out for something to help me sleep or sleep better. The method The S+ uses sonar to monitor your breathing and movement and with that information calculates whether you are asleep and the quality of your sleep. It seemed a bit less dubious than the apps I’d seen friends try, though some experts suggest sleep-monitoring gadgets have trouble distinguishing the different types of sleep. The machine is a small cube in a brushed aluminium stand, like an iPod for insomniacs. Just plug in, load up the app, key in a few bits of data (your weight, height, age), get some basic instructions (you mustn’t put a phone or a glass of water between you and the sonar, for instance) and you are ready to go. At night, you give the app a handful of details about your day, broadly covering alcohol and caffeine intake, stress levels and exercise, and then hit sleep. The machine can play slightly new-age music in tune with your breathing to help you go sleep and has an alarm that claims to work out the optimum time to wake you up and so avoid grumpiness. In the morning, the app calculates a “sleep score”, based on how long you were actually asleep, and the amount of time it thinks you spent in each sleep stage – light, deep and REM (rapid eye movement). Then in the day it gives you tips on how to rest more effectively or deal with tiredness. The results The hypnotic lullaby function (they call it “relax to sleep”) annoyed me with its tinny sound and options such as “ethereal” and “moonlight” but I have to admit I seem to crash into sleep when I put it on. The alarm was much nicer to wake up to than the usual iPhone setting and I did feel a bit less exhausted and groggy in the mornings when I used it. The sleep tracking may be unscientific but I felt it gave me an interesting insight into my rest (or lack of it). After one night when I got eight hours’ sleep and still woke up feeling exhausted, it suggested I mostly got light sleep, none of the deep or REM rest needed to make up a good night. That made sense and somehow I felt a bit less bad about being tired. The tips, which I had expected to be the most helpful thing about the app, were often irritating, patronising or useless. “Try to keep regular hours” is exactly the type of pointless (for me) generic advice I had expected to avoid. They have so much data, but their algorithms apparently ignore pretty basic variables. “Well done!” it told me one morning. “The amount of times you woke during the night is down!” That may have been true, but didn’t really seem a very helpful reflection on a night’s sleep that began in the early hours of the morning after a boozy wedding and didn’t last more than three hours. Overall, though, it helped my sleep. Knowing I’d get a readout in the morning felt a bit like having someone around to remind me to go to bed, I understood how I felt a little better and the alarm and digital lullaby worked quite well. At £130 though, those seem like quite pricey improvements. Emma Graham-Harrison','https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/01/new-year-revolutions-gadgets-for-a-better-you','New Year revolutions: four gadgets for a better you',161,'technology'),('world/2017/jan/01/will-antonio-guterres-be-the-uns-best-ever-secretary-general','When António Guterres resigned halfway through his second term as Portuguese prime minister in 2002 because his minority government was floundering, he did something unusual for a man who had seen the highest reaches of power. Several times a week, he went to slum neighbourhoods on the edge of Lisbon to give free maths tuition to children. “He never allowed a journalist to go with him or let himself be filmed or photographed, and he never let journalists talk to any of his students,” said Ricardo Costa, editor-in-chief of the Portuguese SIC News, who covered Guterres’s political career. The former prime minister told his surprised students that what he was doing was personal and not for show. The Portuguese socialist, who becomes the next UN secretary general on Sunday, is an intellectual who grew up under Portugal’s dictatorship and came of age with the 1974 revolution that ended 48 years of authoritarian rule. Crucial to understanding Guterres, 67, is his Christian faith: his progressive Catholicism always informed his brand of social democratic politics. In the heady days of Portugal’s revolution, it was rare to be a practising Catholic in a new Socialist party where many members had Marxist backgrounds. But Guterres, a star engineering student who grew a moustache in honour of the Chilean left’s Salvador Allende, would eventually become a modernising leader, arguing that his mission was social justice and equality. On the Portuguese left, faith was a delicate issue that required discretion. Under Guterres, the country held a referendum in 1998 on a proposal to liberalise the strict abortion laws. Socialist MPs had a free vote and, as prime minister, Guterres chose not to officially campaign. But it was publicly known that he opposed changing the law, which irked many in his party. The no vote against liberalising the abortion law narrowly won, but turnout was so low that the result was not binding. Abortion laws were finally relaxed in 2007 after a second referendum. Born in Lisbon, Guterres spent stretches of his childhood with relatives in the countryside, where he saw the poverty of rural life under the dictatorship, and later volunteered with Catholic student groups on social projects in the capital. In 1976, the young engineering lecturer was elected a Socialist MP in Portugal’s first democratic vote since the revolution. In parliament, he was a fearsome orator. Such was his talent for verbally destroying political opponents, he became known as “the talking pickaxe”. Guterres became prime minister in 1995. His campaign slogan was “heart and reason”, a cry for more humanism and social politics. Three years earlier he had taken over the Socialist party and modernised it, although he remained to the left of contemporaries such as Tony Blair. For years he led the Socialist International international grouping of leftwing parties. With Portugal’s rapid economic growth and nearly full employment, Guterres was able to set up a guaranteed minimum income and nursery schooling for all. But he had failed to win an absolute majority and was condemned to preside over a tricky minority government. He had to rely on his skill for consensus, always having to negotiate with the opposition parties if he wanted to get anything passed – something he later argued was perfect training for running the UN. “He was a skilful person – very smart, very quick to understand the other point of view and very focused on having solutions – that’s why it worked,” said António Vitorino, Guterres’s deputy prime minister and defence minister. Guterres was furiously hardworking. But behind this was a backdrop of family tragedy. His wife, Luísa Guimarães e Melo, a psychiatrist with whom he had two children, had been critically ill for most of his time in government and was undergoing treatment at a London hospital. “It was one of the hardest moments of his political life,” Vitorino said. “Every Friday morning, he took a plane to London, spent the weekend there in a very desperate situation and then on Monday morning he was back at work. I was his deputy prime minister, I was amazed. I could never have done what he was doing.” In 1998, Guterres’s wife died. The following year, he threw himself into the general elections. He had hoped to win an outright majority but the Socialists ended up one MP short and began a second minority government. This time, a slowdown in the economy made things harder. Guterres, privately growing disillusioned with internal party politics, turned increasingly to his interest in international diplomacy. He had already won praise for his role in resolving the crisis in Timor-Leste, a former Portuguese colony, which had erupted into violence in 1999 after a referendum vote in favour of independence from Indonesia. Guterres led diplomatic efforts to convince the UN to intervene to restore peace. In 2000, when Portugal took the rotating presidency of the European Union, its success was attributed to Guterres’s ability to get big leaders to agree and smaller leaders to be heard. “He did something very original: he looked at what every country wanted and set up an agenda that could be interesting for everyone,” said Francisco Seixas da Costa, a Portuguese diplomat who served as Guterres’s European affairs secretary. “Small countries disappear in the decision-making process so we tried to listen to their interests.” Guterres managed to talk down powerful leaders at loggerheads. “At the European council, I remember a conflict between Jacques Chirac and Helmut Kohl over one issue,” Seixas da Costa said. “Guterres asked for the floor. I was sitting next to him, I was afraid it might be naive. But he took the floor and made a proposal that covered both their interests, and it was a success. It worked. He had a fantastic capacity to moderate and create links and bridges.” In 2002, halfway through his second term as prime minister, Guterres abruptly resigned after the Socialists suffered a drubbing in local elections. He famously said he wanted to avoid the country falling into a “political swamp” and that he had discovered “politics has its limits”. At the time he was unpopular, criticised for too much compromise and too much dialogue. But over the years since his departure, polls showed he was increasingly liked and seen as fair, serious and honest – a possible contender for Portuguese president, although he never wanted to return to national politics, preferring, he said, to make a difference on the world stage. His decade serving as UN high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) from 2005 to 2015 was seen in Portugal as an obvious fit for his personality: socially engaged but seeking common ground. Guterres – who speaks Portuguese, English, French and Spanish and is now remarried to Catarina Vaz Pinto, who works at Lisbon city hall – was known in political circles for enthusiastic, cultured conversations on everything from ancient Greece to Middle Eastern culture, opera to geography. Whenever he had free time during visits to Washington as UNHCR chief, he would get the organisation’s regional representative, Michel Gabaudan, to take him to Politics &amp; Prose or another of the city’s bookshops. “He’s an avid reader of history, and his pleasure was, if we had an hour, to go to a bookshop, so we would have access to books in English that weren’t easy to get in Geneva,” said Gabaudan, now president of Refugees International. “I’m sure this immense knowledge of past and ancient history did inform his political judgment.” Guterres also took a broad approach to the UNHCR’s responsibilities. The organisation grew dramatically under his management, and not just because the number of the world’s refugees soared in the 21st century. He broadened the categories of people the UNHCR would seek to protect, including internally displaced people and migrants forced from their homes by natural disasters and climate change. He preferred the all-encompassing phrase “people on the move”. He managed to persuade donors to fund the expansion by retaining their confidence that the money was well spent, and to do that he cut overheads. “Like all UN organisations, as the organisation had grown up, it had become a little bit top-heavy and one of his first actions was really to slim down headquarters fairly substantially. He sent people back to the field and he put some of the services in much cheaper places than Geneva,” Gabaudan said. “He never thought the details of finance were just for the technicians. I saw him looking at spreadsheets faster than his financial officer, spotting the line or column where we had a problem. So he was really as much hands-on about how the organisation worked as he was the top political figure and spokesman for refugees.” When Justin Forsyth was chief executive of Save the Children UK, he travelled with Guterres to refugee camps in Lebanon, and recalled Guterres meeting a group of children. “The thing that struck me was him cross-legged on the floor of a tent talking to children. He really listens and he asks questions and he’s very moved by what he hears. He gets his hands dirty,” said Forsyth, the new deputy executive director of Unicef, the UN children’s charity. Guterres’s tenure as high commissioner has attracted some criticism. Some former officials said he should have spoken out more strongly in defence of refugee rights enshrined in the 1951 refugee convention. “His record is very mixed, particularly on protection. His tenure was a rough time for the protection of refugees,” a former senior UN official said. He pointed to Thailand forcibly repatriating ethnic Uighurs to China despite the risk they would face persecution. He argued that a tripartite agreement the UNHCR made with Kenya and Somalia on the voluntary return of Somali refugees had paved the way for the reported forced repatriations now under way in Kenya aimed at emptying its biggest camp, at Dadaab. The former official said the EU’s deal with Turkey to repatriate refugees, also widely seen as a violation of basic principles of refugee protection, was largely negotiated while Guterres was at the helm, even if it was only signed in March this year, three months after he left. “His style is to make general statements on the issue but not to directly challenge governments on their actions,” the former official said. “It raises concerns on what he would be like as secretary general.” Jeff Crisp, who was head of UNHCR policy development and evaluation under Guterres and is now a research associate at the University of Oxford’s Refugee Studies Centre, said not all the criticisms could be pointed at the secretary general designate. He said the UNHCR did push back against infringements of refugee rights by European states and had been strongly critical of the EU-Turkey deal. And he argued the tendency to address abuses by authoritarian states by behind-the-scenes persuasion had historically been the “institutional approach” taken by the UNHCR, before and after Guterres. “I think you have to understand that UNHCR’s public criticism of states is very carefully calibrated and in general the more liberal a state is, the more publicly the UNHCR will criticise it,” Crisp said. Adaptable, consensual, affable, intellectual, Guterres is perhaps better qualified than any of his nine predecessors for the world’s most demanding job. But one of his deftest skills he learned not from the hurly burly of Portuguese politics, nor from the harrowing years at the UNHCR, but from his first wife. At a Guardian event last June in which he debated with rivals for the secretary general job, he said her psychoanalytical insights were highly valuable. “She taught me something that was extremely useful for all my political activities. When two people are together, they are not two but six. What each one is, what each one thinks he or she is and what each one thinks the other is,” he said. “And what is true for people is also true for countries and organisations. One of the roles of the secretary general when dealing with the different key actors in each scenario is to bring these six into two. That the misunderstandings disappear and the false perceptions disappear. Perceptions are essential in politics.”','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/01/will-antonio-guterres-be-the-uns-best-ever-secretary-general','Will António Guterres be the UN\'s best ever secretary general?',162,'world'),('careers/2017/jan/01/new-years-resolutions-why-setting-career-goals-is-a-waste-of-time','The best career advice I ever received is that “success is filled with MSG”. It comes from American comedian Amy Poehler’s book Yes Please. Just like the notorious food additive monosodium glutamate (MSG) that leaves you craving more, achieving career goals rarely satisfies for long. The ego is an unsatiated beast that needs constant feeding. That’s why I don’t set careers-related New Year resolutions – and I suggest you don’t either. To explain, let me describe the context in which I read Poehler’s words. I was on a beach holiday, in the midst of a (rather cliched) quarter-life crisis, feeling burned-out and overworked. I had spent much of my early 20s focused on getting ahead and less on living life and having fun. Each year I would set myself unachievable goals: write X number of articles each month, stay later at work, go to talks, try to learn a new language. That day on the beach I realised I had been stuffing my face with MSG and I needed a fresh approach. I followed Poehler’s advice. She advises anyone to treat their career like a bad boyfriend, it will never call you back if you chase it. Instead, play it cool. Act like other aspects of your life – such as hobbies, relationships and passions – are more important (which they are). That’s when you’ll start enjoying your job. I changed the way I viewed work. I put my career a little further down my list of priorities and stopped caring so much. I focused on the aspects of the job I loved and spent more time on them. I stopped chasing success and tried to focus on doing well for myself, following my passions. I tried to be as creative as possible. I ignored arbitrary targets and if I didn’t get everything done, I didn’t worry about it. It worked for me and I started to feel more positive. Then good things came my way; when you stop looking at the phone it finally rings. I’m not advising people stop working hard or let standards slip. I’m talking about cutting yourself some slack and learning to appreciate the world around you a bit more. After all, studies show that happy people do better at work and are more productive. If you need any more convincing that New Year resolutions, career focused or otherwise, are a waste of time then look at the evidence. A study shows that while half of all Americans make New Year’s resolutions, only 8% of them succeed in keeping them. In Britain, it’s a similar picture. According to a ComRes poll for Bupa last year, almost two thirds of respondents admitted to having broken a resolution in the past – and the majority of these (66%) did so within just one month. This is because the goals we set ourselves are usually unachievable. It can be argued that setting realistic goals means success is more likely, but this is still a rather joyless way to approach life. These resolutions are not usually about what you want to be doing, but rather what you think you should be doing. The promises we make around our careers often are based on what other people are doing, or their expectations of us. Perhaps the most convincing argument in favour of career resolutions is the need to focus and make progress. But this is a fallacy that presumes that we have control over the circumstances we are making resolutions about – and we don’t. And if you’re still on the fence, maybe it’s worth remembering these other words from Poehler: “Depending on your career is like eating cake for breakfast and wondering why you start crying an hour later.” Looking for a job?

He grew up in Queens, New York, and then New Jersey, where his father owned a liquor store. In 1999, he began managing the store and eventually renamed it The Wine Library; by 2005, he claims, he had taken the turnover from $3m to $60m. In 2006, he started a Wine Library video blog that ran to 1,000 episodes – his high-energy, forthright delivery got him a spot on Decanter’s Power list. In 2009, he founded the digital media agency Vayner Media with his brother, AJ. He has a 10-book deal with HarperCollins US and his first four books have all appeared on the New York Times bestseller lists. The latest is Ask Gary Vee: One Entrepreneur’s Take on Leadership, Social Media &amp; Self-Awareness and is based on his interactions with his 400,000 subscribers on YouTube. Later this year, he will begin filming Planet of the Apps for Apple TV, a talent show with fellow judges Gwyneth Paltrow, Jessica Alba and Will.i.am, where they will judge and mentor tech startups. Planet of the Apps could make you a lot more famous… I’m definitely going to be known by a lot of people. It’s incredible, this juxtaposition we’re living in now, where you have people who are famous in the traditional sense of print, radio and television, and people who are famous from the online world – and I think they are going to collide very aggressively over the next decade. One of the reasons I want to do things like Planet of the Apps, or speak to you right now for that matter, is that, at the end of the day, it’s just about attention – and I’m not that emotional about where I get that attention. Can you take me back to the mid-1990s, when you were working in your father’s wine shop… how did you spot the opportunity to grow it via the internet? Right now, we look at the micro internet trends – is Snapchat gonna be big? Is VR gonna happen? But back in 1995/6 we were debating the macro internet – ie, whether the internet itself was a thing? When I discovered the internet in 1994, to be frank, I just knew immediately that people would buy stuff on it. It’s not much more complicated than that. I decided I needed to launch a website, but I didn’t know anything about computers, let alone the internet, so for the next two years I learned. In 1996, we launched one of the first e-commerce wine businesses and by 1998-99 I’d realised that email was a very powerful driver for the business. Your Wine Library video blog was popular, but when did you realise you could turn your experience into a digital agency working for blue-chip clients? In December 2008, a couple of gentlemen from ESPN Disney invited me to speak with them. I walked out of that office with two things: a $5,000 cheque, which blew my mind, and the reminder that I had something and that I was seeing the world clearer, faster, easier than my contemporaries. So I called my brother, who was graduating, and said: “Why not get into the client services industry? Why don’t we learn how the biggest brands in the world think… why they are doing the things we don’t believe in?” And that was the start of Vayner Media. What do big brands get wrong about social media? Social media itself is the misconception. Brands think of social media as the smart afterthought – a nice to have, fly-by-night passing thing that they have to appease for AdAge or to make sure they are not out of touch. Social media is just a slang term for the current state of the internet – the websites and apps that people consume on their mobile device. The mobile device is the most important platform in the world: the phone is becoming the television and television is becoming the radio. And Snapchat, Twitter, Instagram and so on are the new CBS, NBS, BBC. When you realise that, then all of a sudden there’s nothing more important. Social media has got a lot of blame for Brexit, the election of Trump – for spreading fake news, legitimising people with extreme views… is that deserved? I think yes and no. The blame is insane. Once again, the human race enjoys blaming a platform rather than itself. So I don’t think it’s Facebook or Twitter’s fault for fake news; it’s human beings’ fault for becoming headline readers and not taking a minute to do their homework. A similar thing happened in the 1960 US presidential election. When people watched the debate on television between John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon, Kennedy looked way better, so if you watched it you thought he won, but if you listened to it on the radio you thought that Nixon won. So technology has always been disrupting democracy? Social media has been disrupting politics and business; it’s just that the mainstream world hasn’t accepted it yet, the same way it didn’t accept cable or the internet or television… People are scared of change… It is pretty fascinating. Humans are very good at holding on to the past… it is an enormous fear of change. When most people see something new they think: “How is this going to hurt me?” and when I see something new I think: “How is this going to help me?” That mentality has been a game-changer for me, and every other entrepreneur, because we’re not scared to fail and we’re not scared to put in work. A lot of people talk about fear of change, but it’s really an enormous fear of extra work or of failing. You’ve talked before about how we’re taught to work on our weaknesses but not bet on our strengths… why is society like that? Because there is more money to be made selling against people’s weaknesses. Is that the kind of selling you do? It looks like that on a surface level, but I think I don’t sell against weaknesses. And I don’t monetise my audience; it would be easy for me to sell marketing courses, ebooks and mastermind courses, but I do not go there. My biggest goal is for my clients to not work with me any more, and for my community to stop watching me, so that they can go out and do their thing. I teach them the tools and the viewpoint and they can go do it themselves. Have you always had unshakeable self‑confidence? Yes, my mother did a good job. I talk with a lot of confidence, but pay attention; I don’t talk about a lot of things, I’m very narrow. I was a very poor student, I was not a star athlete, I’m not the best-looking person of all time, I’m not artistically talented… I’m just a really, really good businessman, I am extremely good with people and I understand them. I triple and quadruple down on that to produce all the things I care about in life. Do you still recommend that people should quit their jobs unless they truly enjoy them? That’s the headline, but I never say quit your job unless it is practical. But I am absolutely affected by the 400 trillion to one thing – which is your chance of being born. It’s real to me. I don’t know how people can’t realise they’ve won the ultimate lottery, so why don’t I maximise my happiness while I have my time on Earth?','https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/01/gary-vaynerchuk-interview-social-media-fake-news-brexit-donald-trump','‘I was seeing the world clearer, faster, easier than my contemporaries’',164,'media'),('books/2017/jan/01/future-sex-a-new-kind-of-free-love-emily-witt-review-orgasmic-meditation-burning-man-polyamory','When Emily Witt turned 30 in 2011, she began to wonder if the future might&nbsp;never arrive. For years, she had assumed that adulthood would bring a sexual terminus. “Like a monorail, gliding to a stop at Epcot Center”, she&nbsp;would disembark and find herself face to face with a loving man. In fact,&nbsp;she had recently been discarded by a boyfriend and for years had alternated brief relationships with periods of reasonably cheerful casual sex, usually with friends. Witt set out to explore the sexual landscape of the present more fully, wanting to find out how her experiences related to the zeitgeist and how her own sexuality might be enriched by learning about the practices of others. Her quest lasted for five years and took her to the Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert, to orgasmic meditation workshops and extreme porn film shoots in San Francisco and to the darker reaches of her computer. At the end of this, her life had externally changed very little but she had changed internally in&nbsp;learning to see sex – “the pure force of sexual desire” – as disconnected from the stories we tell ourselves about&nbsp;love and marriage. The book that results is fascinating, both because it’s always interesting to hear about the sex lives of others and because it opens up an historical context that allows us to understand how the free love of the past did and didn’t lead to our internet-driven sexual&nbsp;present. Witt sees herself as learning about “free love”, but also believes that the term itself has been too&nbsp;discredited by the failed experiments of the 1960s and 70s to be used easily now. She quotes the American radical Ellen Willis stating that though freedom was inherently risky, her generation had felt confident enough to reject security but had then found that “sex has never been safe” and that the losses were as real as the risks: “the deaths, breakdowns, burnouts, addictions”. For Witt, these failures of the counterculture were lessons that led her contemporaries to hold themselves in thrall to “grade point averages, drug laws, student loan payments, condoms, skin protection factors”. And she found that it was these diligent and risk-averse children of the 80s and 90s who were leading the new sexual counterculture. They had renamed free love as polyamory, drawn up shared Google documents with modern regulations and found new ways to free sex from the structures of family life. There’s something a little tiring about this version of promiscuity, which may be simply that it doesn’t sound all that free or all that sexy. Reading about these people’s lives, I shared Witt’s concern that these glossy optimists had never “lived in darkness” by facing either political or existential despair, despite observing global crises and foreign wars, and her sense that she could therefore not quite believe in the&nbsp;strength of their desire. Witt traces the antecedents of contemporary porn back to the 60s as well. It’s because of earlier feminist thinkers that some intellectual women have embraced porn (extreme porn star Princess Donna was led into her career by the writings of Simone de Beauvoir and Judith Butler) and that far more of them have distanced themselves from it, either disapproving of its exploitation or simply believing themselves to be erotically unaffected by celluloid images. I was convinced by Witt’s sense&nbsp;of the need to confront internet porn, given its influence and ubiquity. And when she did so, she was surprised to find that watching “bondage slut gets a rough gangbang” was indeed arousing enough to bring her to orgasm a lot more quickly than mere fantasy could. This is one of the few moments when we witness Witt actually joining in with the sex she describes. She also has sex with a stranger in the orgy tent at Burning Man and has a few unsuccessful goes at orgasmic meditation. Witt is a compelling narrator and an excellent subjective witness but I did find her presence in the book a little coy. There’s no reason why she should feel obliged to try out the sexual practices she’s investigating, but if her journey begins with sexual rejection and uncertainty and ends with sexual freedom and a new kind of&nbsp;enlightened uncertainty, then I think we&nbsp;do need to see the stages in this process. It matters who she has sex with along the way and how she feels about it, but she doesn’t always reveal this. In the chapter on polyamory, she mentions that she’s inhibited at a sex party because she currently has a (presumably monogamous) boyfriend in New York. The boyfriend seems to have disappeared by the time that she’s at Burning Man, but to have had a relationship in the midst of her investigations must have affected the way she experienced her encounters and I felt that she needed to bring herself into the frame more fully. If we don’t learn as much as I would have&nbsp;liked to about Witt, though, we do learn a lot about the sex that might be the sex of a future. Certainly, I understood more by the end about the sexual possibilities open&nbsp;to Californians. It’s not a coincidence that the polyamorists Witt came across in America tended to work in Silicon Valley. If the sexual revolution of the 60s was effected by people who could afford to abandon security, then these are the people who&nbsp;have&nbsp;the means to do so now. California is also the place where new technologies are most swiftly assimilated and therefore where the internet has most easily become part of people’s sex and dating habits. Witt believes that her generation is the last for whom the memory of life before the internet makes virtual reality only partially acceptable and that therefore a new generation will emerge: “Their lives would be free of timidity. They would do their new drugs and have their new sex. They wouldn’t think of themselves as women or men. They would meld their&nbsp;bodies seamlessly with their machines, without our embarrassment, without our notions of authenticity.” This may be true, but where does it leave those of us who remain alienated by technology? If we accept, as Witt does by the end, that monogamous marriage may not be the answer, and that sex may be too important to be confined to loving and lasting relationships, then what is the alternative? I wasn’t any more persuaded than Witt was by the various options she investigated. But I am convinced by Witt herself: convinced that it is worth risking contentment for the sake of experience, that it is important to acknowledge honestly both desire and inhibition, and that it is this that will take us hopefully into a future that may turn out simply to be an ongoing present.

It has its origins in a 45-volume CD set Philips compiled to mark the 200th anniversary of Mozart’s death in 1991. That was a rather one-sided depiction of his genius; this is far more exciting, because it tells the story of everything that has happened to Mozart performance in the following years. Within a green brick-like box are four chunky 50-CD boxes devoted to Orchestra, Theatre, Chamber and a final Sacred/Private/Supplement, plus a biography, notes and pictures. There are the vivid, transparent accounts of the early symphonies by Trevor Pinnock and Christopher Hogwood, moving for the later ones to Frans Brüggen and John Eliot Gardiner. There are the pioneering fortepiano accounts of the concertos by Malcolm Bilson and Robert Levin. But there are always alternatives as well, so devotees of Alfred Brendel, Mitsuko Uchida and Clifford Curzon in the concertos, or even Karl Böhm, Eugen Jochum and George Szell in the symphonies, need not be disappointed. The only drawback is that these are all Universal recordings, so they don’t reach classics by Harnoncourt (except in one aria!), Norrington or Jacobs. Cleverly planned so that contrasted performances of the same work are not lumped on to the same CD, the set takes some navigating, but the result is that each disc is a satisfying listen. Modern instruments are preferred in the chamber music and the operas are shared between disappointing old versions of the early works (except for Christophe Rousset’s stunning Mitridate with Bartoli and Dessay) and much livelier newer versions of the late masterpieces from Solti to Nézet-Séguin. Some of the revelations are in the tiny fragments of pieces that Mozart started but never had a reason or a deadline to finish – here brought together but heart-breakingly incomplete, like his final Requiem. This is music of peerless craftsmanship and deeply ambiguous emotional content –truly music for our age, lovingly assembled.','https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/01/mozart-225-review-cleverly-planned-comprehensive-box-set','Mozart 225 review – all of Amadeus in one big box',166,'music'),('media/2017/jan/01/paul-abbott-no-offence-channel-4-shameless-state-of-play','The celebrated scriptwriter Paul Abbott, creator of Channel 4’s Shameless and No Offence and BBC1’s State of Play, is a skittish presence in person. There’s a frenetic energy to even his most casual actions, so that making a cup of coffee or smoking a cigarette can seem like a mischievous act of escapism. His conversation comes in torrents of half-realised sentences, jokes, profane anecdotes and rat-a-tat laughter. Short in height and teenager-thin, he has burning blue eyes that appear troublingly at odds with the rest of his face, as if they’re seeing something that has nothing to do with what he happens to be talking about. I meet him at his writer’s studio in that posh part of Cheshire where Premier League footballers tend to live. He has just completed a writer’s meeting for a new project he’s started working on about the Pendle witches, the infamous 17th-century witch trials in Lancashire, and he’s still buzzing. “This thing’s only two days in but it’s as clear as a bell,” he says. “It’s just stunning for me, a really exciting sexy route in. I tried writing it other ways before, but there’s only one way to tell it… and it’s come out. Fantastic. Two days!” Abbott is now 56, with a distinguished 30-year career in television, but he retains the enthusiasm – and physique – of a man half his age. Which is no mean achievement, given the life he has led. Every writer is engaged in what John Updike called unpacking his own bag, but some have more baggage to attend to than others. With Abbott, it’s an airport carousel full, a massive load of experience that would have crushed most people, and very nearly put paid to him before he reached adulthood. The bare bones of his biography have been laid out before, but they are hard to skip over. The second youngest of nine children, he was nine when his mother left the family home in Burnley. He didn’t know where she had gone, although it turned out that she had moved in with a man who had a son around Abbott’s own age. His feckless father abandoned the family two years later, leaving Abbott’s eldest sister to raise the children in dire poverty. Abbott was raped by a stranger at 13 – some reports put his age at 11 – and tried to kill himself by jumping off a multistorey car park, but managed only to break his leg. At 15 he had a nervous breakdown, made another suicide attempt and was sectioned. Afterwards he was placed with a foster family, started writing for magazines, won a short-story competition, began a psychology degree at Manchester University – but quit two years in, after he got Alan Bennett to sponsor a radio play he’d written – and then landed a job, at 24, on Coronation Street’s main writing team. By his late 20s he was earning £200,000 a year. And that was before he became really successful. To complicate matters, Abbott is bipolar and has struggled with depression and periods of hyper-creativity. In 2008 he told an interviewer that he had consulted a hypnotist to help him stop having ideas for TV shows, because he found the endless flow debilitating. He also said he was seeing four different psychiatrists and psychotherapists a week. Television is a medium that rewards success with pressing demands for more success. If someone is on a winning streak, then the work offers keep coming thick and fast. It’s why you see certain presenters or actors go through “hot” spells in which they appear to be in everything. And it’s why some TV screenwriters – Abi Morgan and Andrew Davies come to mind – can seem to have monopoly agreements on vast areas of drama. Back in the 90s and 00s, it was Abbott who was at the top of every commissioning editor’s Christmas card list. For about 10 years from 1995, when he was writing Jimmy McGovern’s Cracker, Abbott was to scriptwriting what the fairytale goose was to golden eggs. In one four-year stint, he produced Clocking Off – the acclaimed series of stories set in a factory – the comedy series Linda Green, the stand-out conspiracy thriller State of Play, and the first two series of Shameless, his scabrously autobiographical soap opera about life on the lowest rung of society. He was garlanded with awards by the industry, Hollywood came calling, and here in Britain he was viewed as a kind of hero of social mobility, someone who was born into poverty and chaos and through sheer strength of character and talent not only propelled himself upwards but also retained the humanity to celebrate and satirise his difficult past. He became a visiting professor at Salford University, he was named the fifth most powerful person in television in an industry poll, and was rumoured to be the highest-paid writer in British television. He set up his own production company and was said to be writing a follow-up to the hugely successful State of Play. But it never came. He was also supposed to be writing a 13-part series for the BBC set in the foreign office: it never materialised. There was a Hollywood adaptation of State of Play starring Russell Crowe, which Abbott was asked to write. He turned it down. “I wish I had written it,” he says now, “because I could have written it three times better. But I got paid a lot on that, anyway.” The truth is that Abbott has written very little, by his own once prolific standards, that has come to the screen in the last decade. There have essentially been two shows: Hit &amp; Miss, a six-part Sky TV series about a transgender contract killer, and No Offence, an eight-part comic police procedural drama, which he began writing 10 years ago. Both were well received by critics, but neither quite captured the public imagination in the way that Abbott’s earlier work had done. Now the second series of No Offence, which stars Joanna Scanlan as a plain-speaking and hard-living detective inspector, is about to be broadcast. The first series was a strange confection, a kind of genre mashup, which attempted to ram together some conventional aspects of crime drama with broad comic characterisations and what Abbott refers to as “jet-black” humour. The disparate aspects didn’t always gel convincingly, but it possessed a brio and breakneck daring that carried the audience along. Abbott himself is enormously pleased with the result. “When I pitched No Offence, it was a really hard thing to pitch,” he recalls, as we sit down in one of the studio’s several large rooms. “I couldn’t find my funny bone. I found what I wanted to say, but saying it to someone else industrially for money, it’s really hard. But I just went for it. I bounced off the wall so it was the most lunatic presentation, but that was the personality of the piece. They loved it and I don’t think they believed they’d get the script that matched the pitch, but we matched it. We really did.” Abbott works with a team of writers in the American model. It’s something that enables him to cultivate talent, as well as offset the workload. Unlike many established writers, he’s excited and generous about the next generation of writers making its way. “There’s brilliant stuff coming through, stuff like Fleabag, which shouldn’t have been made with all this [TV executive] scrutiny. Oh we’ve been waiting for that for a long time. Comedy always shows the way for drama at times like these when drama gets a little bit cake-mix.” But the problem for him and his team in writing No Offence was where to place the comedy. In the first drafts of the first series they found themselves yo-yoing between comic lines and police procedure, until Abbott realised that comedy had to be implicit in the drama. The setup of the show – a tough female boss, with two female sidekicks working as Manchester detectives – bore more than a trace of similarity to Scott &amp; Bailey, written by his former Coronation Street colleague, Sally Wainwright. Did that bother him? “Well, no,” he says, “because I was the first on paper, by five years. I’ve done this as a writer, when you’ve got really hot for an idea and they announce on Radio 4 that something’s coming up and you’re ‘Oh, it’s pointless.’ It’s so not. That means the vibe’s on for that subject. That’s when you should get in and write yours.” Abbott is fiercely passionate about his work and says that he has often declined to sell something even when there were keen buyers. “Sometimes if you go into a pitch and everyone just loves it but they weren’t quite listening, I won’t sell that. Because if they don’t know what they’re buying, we’ll get the money but we won’t be supported. It’s cost us a lot of money.” He tells me how pitching has changed down the years, and recalls being asked by one executive why he wanted to write about a younger man getting together with an older woman, as he did in his 1997 romantic drama Reckless. “Because I was married to someone who was 11 years older than me, but actually it turned out after the divorce to be 13,” he says to me, in answer to that unnamed executive’s question. “Isn’t that pointless? Fucking pointless,’ he adds, switching focus now to his ex-wife. “And when I started to work on Coronation Street, [she’d say] ‘Who did you see at work today?’ Oh I wasn’t allowed to mention females. And then she’d ask me why I didn’t mention females – because she taught me how not to – and that drove me round the bend and that’s what split us up: her insistence that I would look for somebody younger. Well, I said, I wouldn’t look for anybody older, and the minute I said that, I knew it was over.” His conversation is littered with these kinds of dramatic asides. With some writers there is a natural impulse to ask where their ideas come from. With Abbott you can almost see his subconscious bubbling away. The older woman was his second marriage, following a short-lived teenage relationship. He then married a script editor, Saskia Downes, with whom he had two children. And he’s now married to his fourth wife, an American with whom he has a young son. He divides his time between Manchester, London, Los Angeles and a house in France. Shameless, which ran for nine years, helped make him a very wealthy man. He stopped writing for it after the fourth series, and lost patience with the direction it took. “It should have stayed less hysterical, more like a saga,” he says. “If it followed that, it would have had a more gentle longevity. It started irritating me the amount of hysteria that had to crack in to keep it going. I got weary. I didn’t really watch it after a while. I didn’t resent it, because it paid us a fortune. But I was glad to see it off.” While he often refers approvingly to earning money, Abbott has never been a writer in thrall to cash. Had he been, he would not have left the sinecure of script editor at Coronation Street. He had been on the show for almost nine years and was materially very comfortable, living in a large house with no mortgage and a steady and substantial income. He recalls the moment he decided to leave the world’s longest-running soap. He was going off on holiday with Downes and their two children when their car broke down. So he decided to stay and write a Coronation Street script to pay for another car. “That genuinely felt wrong,” he says. “You can’t buy a car for a week’s work, and it’s the wrong kind of week’s work. That was the point.” He says his colleagues at Corrie were hooked on the money, embittered about their thwarted ambitions, but unwilling to leave. “Soaps are great,” he later said. “They teach you how to write a lot, but that’s it. It’s opposed to writing. It’s a succubus.” At first, Abbott took a 75% pay cut to write original drama. But it was the beginning of a remarkable run of writing that seemed to spring, with barely any research, straight from his imagination. State of Play, the gripping 2003 drama that starred John Simm as an investigative reporter, Bill Nighy as his editor, and David Morrissey as an MP whose researcher is killed managed to capture the atmosphere and workings of a newspaper without Abbott ever having set foot inside a newspaper office. He wrote it first and then sought technical advice from journalists. The late Simon Hoggart of this parish told him that it was “ridiculous” there was no subeditor in the newsroom, so Abbott wrote one in. But for him, such details are secondary. The most important thing is to make the world he creates seem real, rather than be led by reality. It’s why he ignored the paediatrician employed to advise him on Children’s Ward, one of his early writing jobs, and simply made up illnesses and the drugs to treat them. “Nobody complained,” he laughs. He took the same approach on No Offence – a project he rediscovered in his garage drawer – of coming up with the stories first and then making them fit. His original idea centred on a police station in which the detectives and uniformed officers worked together. But his police adviser told him that detectives don’t work with uniformed police. “That was the whole premise of the show. So I said: ‘What else have you got?’ Oh, he said, unless it’s an integrated policing unit. There you go, but that took about five hours to find out.” He does a lot of his writing out of the country, in France and in Los Angeles, a city he enjoys because he doesn’t feel caught up in the film business. “I don’t really operate at that agency level,” he says. “I shouldn’t say it, but I don’t really want an agent because you’ve only got to go out to dinner with them and tell them lies about what you’re not doing. I don’t want to be as desperate as they make you feel.” A few weeks later in London, I watch a screening of the first episode of the second series of No Offence. It seems tighter than the first series, a little less intrusively jokey. Afterwards, Abbott takes part in a Q&amp;A with some cast members, including Joanna Scanlan and Will Mellor. He tells the audience about his struggle to locate the tone for the show second time round. “I thought it would be easier on the second series, but it was a narrow bandwidth to find again.” He says he’s very proud of its originality. It is unmistakably the work of Abbott, with all his trademark riotous dialogue and jackknife turns. But I’d still love to see him return to the politics and media nexus he explored so memorably in State of Play. Those twin worlds, and our world along with it, have changed beyond recognition in the past 14 years, and it would be fascinating to see Abbott set his dynamic vision on them once more. In a way, 2011’s three-part series Exile, which Abbott co-created but did not write, was a return of sorts. It featured John Simm again, this time as a disillusioned journalist who loses his job and goes back home to his father, who’s suffering from Alzheimer’s. It wasn’t, though, the State of Play 2 that Abbott has referred to on and off for many years. I ask him if he still intends to see that job through. He gives me a wary look. “We’ve talked about that,” he says, eyes down. “It’s dead sexy. It’s just apportioning the next projects. It’s a prospect.” That’s all he’ll say on the subject. But he looks up and those penetrating blue eyes stare off into the distance, as if catching sight of a vivid scene he hasn’t yet written. “I feel as energetic as ever,” he says. Commissioning editors, stay tuned – and don’t forget to listen.

You only ever see them in movie versions of London – sleek, soulless, improbably empty lairs for Bond villains or corporate baddies. But, it turns out, they exist in the real world, too – like the 11th floor Lambeth apartment Raimund Berthold and his partner, Paul, have shared for over a decade. In some ways, it’s just like countless other London flats. Bedroom, bathroom, open kitchen/living room, room-too-small-to-be-anything-but-a-spare-room, each stuffed with its owners’ treasured possessions. But this one comes with a panorama that sweeps from the MI6 building and Battersea power station to the palaces of Parliament and Millbank. And the clutter is an enviable collection of contemporary art. It’s a long way from the ski resort of Arlberg, Austria, the designer’s childhood home. “Great winters, boring summers!” he laughs. “But I was always a city boy at heart.” In the late 1990s, he came to visit a friend in London and never left. Berthold ended up at Central Saint Martins, and (after stints at McQueen, Westwood and Ferragamo) went solo. He’s gone on to become one of London menswear’s quieter success stories, with his own studio in Soho, a recently launched webshop, and a loyal international customer base. The couple bought the flat in the early Noughties, when the building – a brick 1960s office block wedged into the middle of the Albert Embankment – was converted into flats. Back then, surrounded by industrial units, it was lacking the kind of homely, domestic warmth they’d have called heimlich back in Arlberg. But for Berthold, that was part of the charm. “It’s a bit less villagey round here. I don’t really need to know the neighbours.” Light and low-ceilinged, the flat is thoughtfully laid out, with grey-veined marble flooring and storage neatly folded away into flat white walls. Rather than being displayed with gallery precision, the couple’s art collection mingles fluidly with their everyday life. Battered concrete spheres by Oscar Murillo cluster in the living room corners, alongside a Klara Lidén video and Lego-filled silicone legs by Ed Fornieles; Magali Reus padlocks float off a column next to a tree-trunk installation by Pipilotti Rist. The tiny study has been taken over by vast, primary coloured canvases and mannequins by Thai painter Korakrit Arunanondchai. “We’ve got one more piece coming, a huge lightbox.” Berthold confesses. He looks around half-despairingly. “Maybe the books could go…” The furnishings are low-key, yet elegant, from a cocoon-like midcentury chair (a present from Paul’s Finnish mother), reupholstered in tufted grey fabric, to the smocked-leather Patricia Urquiola seat, placed at the living room’s prow, which spins to allow its owner his own moment of Bond villain excess. It’s the perfect spot for a despot to survey his city. “At night, it becomes this amazing backdrop of lights. I like that it feels kind of anonymous.” Berthold says. “You sit in the middle, observing rather than being part of something.” Anonymity may well have been the lure, but its occupant’s hospitable personality is stamped all over the apartment. As you leave – past an early Tracey Emin sketch, a pair of legs upended to flick a cheery farewell V-sign – what’s striking isn’t the view or Berthold’s extraordinary collection of objects. It’s how very heimlich his home is, despite it all.','https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jan/01/london-penthouse-flat-with-contemporary-art-collection','Raimund Berthold\'s penthouse panorama',169,'lifeandstyle'),('lifeandstyle/2017/jan/01/how-we-transition-into-new-year','You may have woken up today feeling a little more wobbly than usual, not just from last night’s festivities, but about what 2017 holds. We can’t help our memories of last year colouring our expectations of the next. We’re wired that way. We know this from the Colour Phi experiment in 1976, where respondents were shown a blue dot at the top left hand corner of a screen followed soon after by a red dot at the bottom right. What they reported seeing was a dot moving from top to bottom, and changing to red midway. Our brain creates an illusion, joining up the two dots and projecting the colour of the red dot backwards in time. The same applies to how we view our own life story and our hopes for the new year. It’s a funny point each January where we’re caught between imagining the future and knowing the past. In Roman tradition, Janus is the god of endings and beginnings, with two faces, looking backwards and forwards. This story of transition should reassure us. We make it up as we go along.

This is the year you will limp out into, like Winona at the end of Heathers, lighting a fag on the embers of your ex. With a certain swagger. A dark sort of acceptance. This is the year you will be confident in the knowledge that David Bowie will not die, that Hillary Clinton will not lose, and that half the UK will not be left reeling at the realisation it doesn’t know its neighbours. This is the year Harambe will not be shot. This is the year your plans for a “nice New Year’s Day walk” will not meet you in the darkness of 4pm shattered on the kitchen floor. This is the year you will stroll across the heath, belly full of toast, nodding at dog walkers with a holiness that more than makes up for the horrors of last night. This is the year you will stop pretending to be in control in meetings, and actually unlock the secret level that enables you to look a colleague in the eye and politely tell them they’re wrong. This is the year you will decide what you like. What kinds of chairs. What kinds of sandwich. This is the year you will decide what you want to do for work, rather than what you think your dad might have wanted. This is the year you will watch an entire episode of a Channel 4 drama without looking at your phone. This is the year you will look in the mirror and think, “Fine.” A full-length mirror, in sunlight, no less than halfway through the working day. You will rub cream into your face that evening with the firm care of a Kensington masseuse. This is the year you will get rid of all trousers that make you feel like a failure, all shoes that call their own Ubers. This is the year that the older temps told you would come as you sat, 19, and nervous during their fag break – the year everything slips comfortably into place. This is the year you will get back in touch with them, those old friends you left behind when you moved out of the world and on to the internet for its mild winters and promise of summer. You’ll sit round a real-life table and look at pictures of their kids, and cackle when Leah spills your drink all over the chips when gesticulating during a story about lilies. This is the year when the pressure to change – the pressure that is traditionally amplified today – retreats in a tide of blue, rather than, as in previous Januaries, becoming a furious string section in your head, preventing you from moving even sideways. A pressure which once led only to inertia and disappointment will this year be replaced by a kind of blooming, much like when a dinner is cancelled and you sink back into the sofa with all the wonder of an evening free. This is the year when, instead of attempting your usual outrageous improvements re friendship, fitness or intelligence, you will succeed in doing things such as: using those colour-catcher sheets in the washing machine. Reading the business pages of a newspaper. Looking after a friend’s baby for a whole afternoon while they sit at yours and watch Transparent. This is the year you stop apologising for the food you cook. This is the year you will walk past a vegetable stall and laugh at the size of an avocado. You will take it home where your boyfriend will laugh, too. You’ll cut it in half, spoon out the stone, and eat it together, and the whole thing will take ages and ages. This is the year you will get everything you want, because you will want a little less. This is the year the cactus will flower. This is the year you will learn all your online passwords without having to check the desktop document cunningly titled Carpet Estimates 2013. This is the year you will stop getting cold calls from charities that had almost made you give up giving. This is the year you stay home from parties to which you’d only have gone to avoid missing out. This is the year you will catch sight of your sullen reflection in the dark screen between Netflix episodes and smile at the self-portrait – a cup of tea balanced on your chest, glasses low on your nose, this is you, and it will be you tomorrow, too.

Large developments and infrastructure projects are planned in some of the UK’s most treasured tourist destinations, including the Lake District, the Cotswolds, and Sussex’s High Weald as well as on large swaths of green belt land. Britain’s open spaces are likely to come under further pressure in the next few years. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, pledged £23bn for the National Productivity Investment Fund in his autumn statement, with money earmarked in the next five years to create an Oxford to Cambridge expressway and new railway infrastructure in the Midlands. The government has also set a target of 200,000 new homes a year, and some expect that target to be increased in the housing white paper, due to be published this month. Shaun Spiers, chief executive of the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE), said there was “a real concern” about the way development is being prioritised. “Everybody recognises that we need to update infrastructure, and the CPRE’s traditional role since it was set up in 1926 has been to question whether or not it’s necessary and if there are alternatives to industrialising landscapes,” Spiers told the Observer. “There’s a terrible sense right now that ministers are just keen to say that Britain’s open for business at the expense of everything else. It’s all justified on narrow economic grounds, and I’m not sure anyone is standing back and saying ‘what are the alternatives?’” One major infrastructure development under consideration is the National Grid’s £2.8bn plan to connect the planned Moorside nuclear power station, Sellafield’s replacement, to the UK power network with a 102-mile long power line. The route goes through the Lake District national park, and while the National Grid plans to put 15 miles of cabling underground through the park, 90 pylons each 48m (160ft) tall, will be erected in a line just 10m from the park’s southern edge through the Duddon estuary. Campaigners from the group Power Without Pylons and the Friends of the Lake District will gather today for a protest walk through the area. “It would destroy some of the most spectacular landscapes of the national park,” said the organisation’s Elaine Essery. “We think there are better alternatives – and they would amount to tens of pence on people’s electricity bills.” The National Grid’s final consultation on the issue closes this Saturday. With the pylon scheme considered a “nationally significant infrastructure project”, the final decision on whether it will go ahead will be taken by the Secretary of State, currently Greg Clark, at the department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Of 50 schemes that have been decided since NSIP rules were introduced in 2008, only one has so far been rejected, according to Power Without Pylons. To add to campaigners’ fears, planning laws and regulations on house-building have been significantly relaxed in recent years in an attempt to address the housing shortage in the south-east of England. CPRE research in April showed that 275,000 homes are proposed for green belt land. Plans to build 600 homes near Pease Pottage in Sussex, on the High Weald, have been approved, and a further 60 will be built in the Cotswolds in Milton-under-Wychwood. Proposals to build 119 homes in Hungerford in the North Wessex Downs are awaiting a decision.','https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/01/countryside-under-threat-ministers-infrastructure-britain-open-business','UK countryside at risk in rush to declare Britain ‘open for business’',173,'environment'),('lifeandstyle/2017/jan/01/be-happy-not-mindful','“Happiness comes from within,” declare a thousand advice blogs and books, fridge magnets and Facebook memes. Or “withinwards” as my local yoga studio prefers to call it. The idea that happiness comes from looking inwards rather than outwards has taken a deep hold in our collective psyche in recent years. We no longer see wellbeing as a facet of community or engaging with others but as an inner journey, a self-focused personal quest. Most of the recent happiness trends, from self-help books to meditation, are designed to be carried out either completely alone, or with the explicit aim that each person stays locked in their own private emotional experience. In the United States this appetite for inner exploration has spawned a multi-billion dollar industry. Americans spend around $1bn on self-help books each year, and $4bn on mindfulness products and therapies ($12m of this on mindful colouring books alone). A further $10bn a year is spent on yoga classes and accessories. There are now more than 1,000 options for happiness apps to help us find bliss deep within our smartphones. It all adds up to a strange kind of emotional individualism. But this level of self-focus has come at the expense of outward engagement. Our narrative of wellbeing has become divorced from community, social justice or wider political responsibility. Even the hugely popular mindfulness trend, which on the face of it advocates paying attention to the outside world, urges it in only its most apolitical form – a “non-judgmental awareness” of whatever is directly in front of us right this second, deliberately renouncing analysis, critical thinking or wider imaginative empathy. But while we have been locked in this mindful-colouring, downward-dogging bubble, we failed to notice a profound disaffection and rage growing within society. Ignored for so long, this deep-seated discontent found its expression in a dangerous, misogynistic, racist demagogue. Many of us were blindsided by Donald Trump’s recent victory. We were probably at a yoga class. Even before this toxic election, according to the World Health Organisation, the US was already, by a wide margin, the most anxious country on the planet. Now anxiety levels have skyrocketed. Suicide hotlines across the country have seen sharp increases in call numbers since the election. Therapists report widespread “Trump-anxiety” among their clients. It would be tempting to see the solution to this outpouring of distress as yet more inner exploration. More mindfulness exercises and yoga classes and digital detoxes, in which we deliberately disengage from the news in service of our own mental health. But that somewhat solipsistic mentality was part of what got us here in the first place. What we urgently need now is not inner exploration, but outward engagement. Not “non-judgmental awareness” but critical thinking. It would be easy to sell this as a self-help proposition in and of itself. Excessive self-focus has been shown by research to lead to unhappiness, anxiety, loneliness and depression, whereas its opposite, social connection, is overwhelmingly the single biggest source of human happiness. But this is far more important than a self-help mantra. For the sake of the future of the planet, now is the time not to journey “withinwards”, but for vigilance and action.

Meal for two, including drinks and service: £100 Over the past year London has been overrun by an outbreak – a flock, if you will – of chicken-based restaurants. We’ve had Fancy Funkin Chicken in Brixton and Clockjack in Woolwich, Randy’s Wing Bar in Stratford and Absurd Bird in Shoreditch and many more besides. And why not? Chicken is the David Attenborough of food; it’s hard to hate. Chicken cooked by a restaurant is the homely dinner you can’t be fagged to cook at home. The Holy Birds in Shoreditch, which is rather less divine than its name suggests, takes this one step further. It’s not just about chicken. It’s about all things feathered: duck and goose and guinea fowl and so on. But mostly, to be honest, chicken, which are offered whole as standard, off the rotisserie or roasted with a beer can up their jacksy. The problem is that most of us have roasted a chicken ourselves. We can take a view as to what makes a good one. That means there is nowhere to hide. In the case of the Holy Birds, this is literally so for it contains a big open kitchen. Being Shoreditch it is occupied by chefs with fearsome beards, intensely basting birds on the rotisserie, as though the very meaning of “now” is embedded in this relentless activity. The room in front of that kitchen is orange. Very orange. It’s like they’ve broken Donald Trump down for parts and used them to kit out a dining room. There’s an orange counter, orange dangly lights and orange banquettes, plus various bits of midcentury modern furniture and wood panelling. If the art director on Mad Men had got completely off their tits on Fanta and then set to work, it would look like this. I can’t pretend. Their “hip” and “stylish” is my “exhausting” and “Can I go home now, please?” The food doesn’t help. A pigeon pastilla should be the very definition of sweet meat, the slow cooked bird turned into a confection by the application of sugars and nuts before being wrapped in filo. These faux Moroccan pastries are dry, bland and entirely devoid of sweetness. Alongside is an under-dressed green salad which is wet, as if it hasn’t been properly spun after being washed. A pork and goose terrine is served in fridge-cold slabs so tastes of almost nothing. As it warms up it improves, but not enough to become an exemplar of the art. There are many ways with quail in London: there are the smokey quails of the Turkish mangal restaurants, for example, or the crisp deep fried versions with chilli offered by the Chinese. The chargrilled quails here are fine, though expensive at £16.50; the accompanying “burnt” onion is exactly what it says it is: a fat half onion all but incinerated at its tips. It goes uneaten. And so to the rotisserie chicken, £14 a half. For me the best of these are to be found in the street markets of France, where they are cooked long and slow, until the skin is crisp, the meat is sagging, and the fat gathers at the bottoms to be used for sautéed potatoes. When eating one there, never think too deeply about the quality of the bird involved. Because it’s France we assume it’s a quality hen. The next time you order one, just look at the price and reach your own conclusion. The chickens used here, on the other hand, are clearly very good. They have been allowed to grow and mature slowly. That does make for denser, more flavourful but sometimes tougher meat, which they have tried to mitigate through brining and it almost works. There are various brine options. We choose garlic and herb over citrus and peppercorn or paprika The problem is twofold. First, there’s the finish. Sure, the skin is dark, but only in places. Elsewhere it’s soft and floppy. Secondly, it tastes not of garlic or herbs, but salt. Roasted chicken skin should be one of life’s filthy pleasures. This is a disappointment fashioned from calories. The menu offers “extra gravy” at £1.50. I take this to mean gravy in addition to that which already comes with the bird. Except the chicken doesn’t come with gravy. Weirdly this “extra” gravy has a deep meatiness but none of that meatiness tastes of chicken. Duck fat potatoes turn out to be soft overcooked new potatoes in their skins drenched in the greasiest bit of the duck. By now I am irritated. But the lacklustre food is not helped by the service. Writing about these things is tricky. It can look peevish. It can look haughty. But the effect is cumulative and therefore has to be reported. As ever I have booked under another name, but the maître d’ makes it clear he knows who I am as he introduces himself. I thank him, but ask to be treated like any diner. Apparently this includes trying to bring side dishes we didn’t order because he thought we might like them. I send them back. He overhears my companion mention the fact it’s her birthday. So now the dessert we order turns up on a plate with a birthday message piped on. For what it’s worth, which is a lot, she had told me she didn’t want a fuss made. Otherwise I would have asked for something like this. (That dessert is a passable trifle, topped with cream that has been over-whipped to the point of splitting). At the start of the meal when I’d asked about sparkling wines he’d mentioned Babycham, God help us. Now, as he brings the bill, he announces that he saw my companion’s eyes “light up” at the mention so here’s a bottle for your birthday. They didn’t light up. She hates Babycham, but was trying to be polite in the face of aching Shoreditch drink irony. We decline it (as we would any freebies). Maybe you think mentioning all this is unfair. Maybe you think it’s just hospitality on overdrive. Fair enough. But let’s just say there’s an art to being genuinely hospitable; it’s one which has not yet been acquired here. Halfway through lunch my companion nips to the loo – it says “hens” and “cocks” on the doors, of course it does – and stumbles across a waitress in tears, being comforted by a colleague. She lends her mascara. If I was less of a gentlemen I might portray this as some clumsy sort of commentary on the whole damn meal, but that would be cheap, which is something I never am. Much like this lunch. Jay’s news bites If you fancy a bird-only menu you might do better at chef Carl Clarke’s Chick ’n’ Sours, the second of which has just opened in Covent Garden. As the name suggests they do sour cocktails and chicken. But oh, what chicken: buttermilk fried, with big flavours. It comes with ‘seaweed crack and pickled watermelon’, as disco wings (naked, sticky or hot), and in buns (chicknsours.co.uk). There’s cash in cornflakes. The Cereal Killer Café concept – a selection of breakfast cereals, sold by the bowl – is to follow its third UK site, in Birmingham, with new franchised branches in Jordan, Dubai and Kuwait. Apparently a sheikh Snapchatted his visit, turning the original Shoreditch café into a point of pilgrimage (cerealkillercafe.co.uk). Progress! The devoutly French classical Bocuse d’Or cooking competition has announced its theme for 2017 and for the first time it is about non-meat cookery. The competing chefs will have to create 14 identical dishes using vegetables, fruit, cereals and seeds.

What kind of hangover do you have? Like Lucky Jim, has your mouth been used as a latrine by some small creature of the night, and then as its mausoleum? Or maybe, like Ned Beauman’s Egon Loeser, you’ve woken with the conviction that somewhere in northern Rhodesia an elephant that got drunk on fermented marula fruit and rampaged through a village is enjoying your hangover, while you endure theirs. Writers have always been drawn to hangovers because they do so much metaphorical legwork. Even the simplest statements come with a lovely dollop of pathos. They punish excess but we don’t understand them. They get worse as you get older. Every cure is unique and none is reliable. And like all good poetry, hangovers resist interpretation. Whatever you think you’ve read about congeners and sulphites and wine before beer, it’s all twaddle. If any scientist had come within 10 miles of the secret, they’d be running for election in a plane with their name on the side. Actually, that’s not true. There are three failsafe cures: swimming in a cold sea, skiing and Having Something Important On, of which the last is by far the most effective. Sadly none of them are available on Deliveroo, so here’s some more practical advice. Typically these pieces come with a warning about excessive drinking and dehydration, but here’s a more dire warning: none of these will cure the angst. Maybe your friends really don’t like you. Maybe you are bad at your job. Things to think about as you stand by the toaster. Bloody Mary There’s always a Bloody Mary bore, isn’t there? “Extra spicy,” they’ll say at the bar, like they’re Clint Bloody Eastwood. This is a drink made from leftovers mushed into a glass and disguised with spice, like one of those potions young children make with everything they find under the sink. Presumably it’s another black-ops initiative by the Spanish, after gazpacho and salmorejo and that absurd festival in Buñol, to get rid of their spare tomatoes. Don’t fall for it. Bacon sandwich A hangover makes you feel tired and dirty. You want to feel clean and awake. No bacon sandwich ever made someone feel more clean and awake. The Full English The same goes for the Full English. It’s time the Full English was recognised for what it is, which is the back of the butcher’s larder – cheap sausage, lardy bacon, crusty blood – mushed on to a plate and disguised with jingoism. A pint The only man who’s allowed a pint the morning after is Danny Dyer, and only if he’s at Gatwick. Are you Danny Dyer? Are you at Gatwick? Coconut water We’re all in thrall to Big Coconut. No, it’s not “better than water”. Toast and marmalade The argument for marmalade is that it tastes the same going down as it does coming back up. A good argument. Jeeves’s remedy Raw egg, tabasco, Worcestershire sauce. In effect a Bloody Mary with raw egg instead of tomato juice. Impressive, if disgusting. Tea Fine. Boiled eggs A German friend of mine swore by boiled eggs, which he’d dip like radishes in salt. Eggs are a good test of recovering motor function. If you can run to a couple of perfect soft-boilers, you’re probably fine to drive. Ramen All right until the pasta settles. Kedgeree Delicious, but too ricey. Pickle juice Some Eastern Europeans recommend a glass of pickle juice. I’ve never had it, but equally I’ve never had a hangover worse than how bad this sounds, so perhaps that’s how it works. The Only Patent Proven Hangover Solution Before bed: 1 litre of water, 1 Dioralyte sachet, two paracetamol, two ibuprofen. On waking: one banana, two double espressos, fags (to taste), more medicine (as appropriate). Long walk. Optional extra Ribena with ice and fizzy water: since they scandalously discontinued Ribena Sparkle you have to DIY this. Well worth it, though.

There are few New Year’s resolutions that survive the time it takes to make them. If, say, I’d vowed to have a dry January this year, I’m sure I’d have blown it by lunchtime. One commitment I could conceivably keep, however, would be to drink more adventurously in 2017. And so, having tried, towards the end of 2016, my first genuinely interesting, if impossibly expensive, Chinese wine (the swirling perfumed Cabernet of Ao Yun from vineyards in the foothills of the Himalayas, just £225 a pop), I’m looking for other unusual places. Cyprus, for example, has never been part of my drinking repertoire. But the bright blackberries and earthy-spiciness of M&amp;S’s latest find suggests it should be. Michael Klouda Broken Vine Zinfandel, Lodi, California 2014 (£19.95, Lea &amp; Sandeman). The idea that we can reassess our convictions in a spirit of open-mindedness was not very 2016, but I’d like to think 2017 could be different. In wine, I’ve tended to be a bit down on zinfandel, the Californian version of Italy’s primitivo, if only because many are loud, fat and crude with their massive alcohol and sweet, jammy fruits. But it’s time I admitted this was an outdated stereotype. Neither the wonderfully brisk and aromatic Broc Cellars Vine Starr Zinfandel 2015 (£35, Roberson Wine) nor the red-berried silky succulence of Michael Klouda Broken Vine comes cheap. But both offer a more pleasurable return on investment than a seldom-used gym membership. Larry Cherubino Apostrophe Possessive Red, Frankland River, Australia 2014 (£12.50, Oddbins). Australia’s rehabilitation as a country capable of far more than chardonnay sunshine in a bottle has been ongoing for some time. But the past two years have seen a wave of new producers make their presence felt in the UK. These smaller production wines aren’t cheap: the super-tangy Chenin Blanc Dynamic Blend 2015 (£32.99, Oz Wines) and the bold, sinewy red Pirate Blend 2013 (£39.89, Corking Wines) from Margaret River’s LAS Vino are for special occasions. Coming at a more realistic price, but offering plenty of modern Aussie style, Larry Cherubino’s Rhônish blend is a deliciously herby, soothing start to 2017.

Usually, the bigger the show, the better the hang. This is one of the times it happened that way. Britt [Ekland, then Phantom’s wife] and I went to see Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band at the LA Coliseum. This would have been the Born in the USA tour and there was a lot excitement. Britt’s a huge a fan, guitarist Nils Lofgren was a good buddy, The Boss was a fan of the Stray Cats and had been on stage with us for a jam the summer before, so we were pretty welcome at the gig. There was a pre-show hang-out in one the skyboxes above the stadium. I had been at this game for a few years already and felt comfortable and confident meeting and talking to anyone, especially in a rock’n’roll setting. Britt had been everywhere and seen everything. There was an elevator that led from the parking area right up into the owner’s box. This was a civilised, cocktail party-type of backstage hang, not exactly the punk rock dressing room melees I had started out in. I was drinking a mixed drink out of a plastic cup, I had a record on the radio and I’m there with my movie star wife, so everything’s just fine. I happened to be looking towards the elevator at the exact moment the doors opened and a hush fell over the room. Out walks Michael Jackson and Elizabeth Taylor, just the two of them. MJ was in his full Thriller-era regalia: sparkly, sequined military jacket with gold rope dangling from the epaulet, mirrored aviators, hair perfectly jheri-curled, glitter socks, black loafers and, most importantly, one bedazzled glove. Elizabeth Taylor looked every bit the world’s greatest movie star in a jewelled gown and matching shoes. This is all happening in the middle of the afternoon in a big glass box at the top of a football stadium. No one is saying anything and an uneasy quiet held the room. Is anyone there to meet them? Who will they talk to? Will someone offer them a drink? What are they actually doing here? MJ slowly saunters up to me, offers his gloved hand and, in his unique, child-like sotto voce, half-whispers: “I really like that song you guys do about the cat.” “Um, thanks, man,” I managed to quietly croak out as I shook the gloved hand. I’m flabbergasted. There’s a difference between a “Wow this is cool” moment and being totally blown away. I think Liz and Britt said hello to each other and spoke for two seconds. MJ and Liz made their way around the room, got back into the elevator and were gone before the show even started. I don’t remember another time quite like this, before or since. For me, most of those wacky moments hit me after the fact and I realise, a little later, that something special had happened. • A Stray Cat Struts: My Life as a Rockabilly Rebel by Slim Jim Phantom is published by St Martin’s Press at £18.99.

We were heading north but had run out of juice – both us and the car – and £40 for a double in the Days Inn sounded if not romantic, then functional at least. But my wife was worried it was a motel not a hotel, and that therefore we’d “be murdered, like in America!” We headed to the check-in where the night manager looked like a young, blond Schwarzenegger.

By dawn, the nocturnal weirdness had lifted and under a low winter sun we cracked on up to the blissful open roads of Dumfries in the safe embrace of Audi’s new A6 Allroad. As a car it is the diametric opposite of a David Lynch series. There are no unnerving moments, no unexpected twists, no surprise endings. This isn’t edge of the seat driving: it’s back of the sofa under a duvet with a mug of Ovaltine driving. It’s big, comfortable and so incredibly dependable. It could be a father figure to you, if you happen to be missing one. It also hopes to be every car you’ll ever need. It’s a large estate that has the on-road smoothness of a premium saloon, but also the off-road roughness of a no-nonsense SUV. Over a long weekend I covered more than 1,000 miles in it – many of them with its perspicacious cruise control holding the fort. During one stretch I must have driven at least two hours without touching either the throttle or brake. One reason it drives so well is the air suspension, which raises and lowers to suit conditions. This makes the A6 far nimbler than a car of its size has any right to be. The fact that it has lost 20% of its overall weight compared to the outgoing model also helps. This means the model I drove, which featured a 201bhp 3-litre engine, was still able to reach 62mph in 7.5 seconds and do just over 50 miles to the gallon. Audi claims these are best-in-class running costs. The Allroad used to look quite beefy, with lumpy plastic wheel arches and huge bumpers. Now it looks a lot sleeker. To my eye that’s an improvement, but the horsey set might turn their noses up at it – the equestrian market is key for this model. Horse-mad or not, everyone will appreciate the huge boot and luxurious interior. Safety tech and driver aids are, as you would expect from Audi, well up to snuff. The Allroad is an SUV for people who don’t want to look like they’re driving an SUV. Maybe it is a surprise package after all.

Amid all this oozing bravado, those with sensitive palates (and stomachs) might be forgiven for thinking the only thing this crop has going for it is pure fire power. Yet chillies actually contain a raft of other deliciously fruity, sweet and aromatic flavour chemicals that offer up so much more than mind-numbing heat. There are loads of varieties out there that contain very little or no pungency at all and are eaten by the plateful, far more like a mild pepper than a spice. If you think you don’t like chillies because of fire factor, I implore you to give these a go, and late winter is a great time to start sowing them. Chillies are a group of closely related species that are given their spicy kick by a chemical called capsaicin. However, many varieties contain mutations that block the production of this pungent chemical, sometimes almost completely, giving all the flavour but none of the fire. A classic (and fantastically tasty) example of this is Trinidad Perfume, a habanero type variety that provides all the knockout aroma of these normally searing-hot varieties, but is – as if by magic – as sweet and mild as a bell pepper. In fact, even regular peppers are also just varieties of chilli whose genetic mutations block the production of capsaicin. As with all habanero types the exotic Trinidadian needs warmth to fruit well, so always grow indoors (a greenhouse or by a large, sunny living room window.) A more familiar example of a low-spice chilli would be Padrón peppers from northern Spain that kick out massive crops of richly savoury, bullet-shaped fruit. Traditionally, they are eaten seared in a hot pan and served doused in salt and olive oil. Curiously, however, about one in 10 of these normally sweet fruit can pack a bit of heat, especially in larger or more mature fruit, so be warned – it can be a game of Spanish roulette. The most reliable mild chilli for growing outdoors for me is the Banana pepper, which has waxy, yellow fruit and all the citrus floral hints of the closely related Hungarian Hot Wax, just without the bite-back. Apple Crisp is so ridiculously mild-mannered it can be eaten like – well – an apple, with super dense walls of crunchy flesh. Amazing in salads. Finally, Thai Green Curry is a variety with the deepest, darkest green fruit, traditionally used to add colour and depth to curries, but without a trace of heat – other chillies are added for that.

At a star-studded party at the Mar-a-lago resort, which he owns, on Palm Beach. Tickets cost $575 for guests, and $525 for members. According to Vanity Fair, Trump’s attendance has raised questions of a potential conflict of interest, with critics concerned the event could be perceived as selling access to the president-elect. Incoming White House Director of Strategic Communications Hope Hicks told the press, “The transition is not concerned about the appearance of a conflict. This is an annual celebratory event at the private club, like others that have continued to occur since the election.” Hicks added, “the president cannot and does not have a conflict.” Celebrations in Barcelona looked pretty spectacular.

Hurt is the author of “Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump,” a 1993 book that revealed among other things that Trump was accused of “rape” by his ex-wife Ivana Trump in a sworn deposition during their divorce proceedings. On Friday, Hurt approached Trump on the practice tee at Trump International Golf Club, and congratulated him on his victory in last month’s presidential election, according to an account that Hurt posted on Facebook on Saturday. Trump responded by criticizing Hurt’s biography as untrue, to which Hurt replied “It’s all true,” according to both Hurt’s Facebook post and a transition official who was briefed on the incident, but did not want to be identified discussing a testy exchange involving the president-elect.

Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate, lit up by fireworks to mark the incoming of 2017. Fireworks blaze above the Acropolis hill and Parthenon temple in Athens during the new year celebrations. People wait for the stroke of midnight in the Grand Place, Brussels. Revellers in Pakistan set off firecrackers to celebrate the arrival of the new year in Lahore. A backdrop of green envelops Moscow’s Red Square as the capital ushers in the new year. In his year-end message, Pope Francis has urged leaders to do more to tackle youth unemployment, saying a generation was being lost to desperation, migration and joblessness. At his last public event of 2016, an evening vespers service in St Peter’s Basilica, the 80-year-old pontiff said doors had to be opened for young people “so that they can be capable of dreaming and fighting for their dreams”. “We have condemned our young people to have no place in society, because we have slowly pushed them to the margins of public life, forcing them to migrate or to beg for jobs that no longer exist or fail to promise them a future,” he said in his homily. The world’s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa, is lit up to mark New Year’s Day in Dubai. In her new year message, the British prime minister has moved to reassure those who voted for Britain to stay in the European Union that she will fight for their interests “around the negotiating table in Europe this year”. Read the full story here: King Maha Vajiralongkorn has called for unity in his first new year address since taking over from his late father, who was widely seen as a unifying force during decades of turbulence. The pre-recorded address was only the second time he has spoken to the public since taking the throne on 1 December. “No matter what problems we may face in our country, we believe that if we work together we can overcome and alleviate any situation,” said the king in the broadcast. He thanked the public for their show of loyalty towards his father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, still widely mourned after a rule that spanned seven decades. The usual new year firework displays in Bangkok have been cancelled this year out of respect for the mourning period. Hogmanay celebrations have got under way in Scotland’s capital as thousands of people arrived to bring in the new year. Up to 80,000 people are expected to gather on the streets of Edinburgh for the sold-out world-famous event which Paolo Nutini will headline. There will be performances from The Charlatans, Fatherson and Be Charlotte. Three firework displays – at 9pm, 10pm and 11pm – come before the crescendo of the spectacular midnight moment display from the ramparts of Edinburgh Castle. Thousands of partygoers will join hands to sing the world’s largest rendition of Auld Lang Syne at the stroke of midnight, with images being beamed around the globe of Scotland’s big party night. Pope Francis finds a moment to reflect in front of a nativity scene in St Peter’s Square, Rome. One of the most impressive displays of the night comes from Hong Kong, where the city’s skyline was illuminated in blue and pink. Singapore welcomes in 2017 with a fireworks display at Marina Bay. Revellers in Australia have been enjoying the first hours of New Year’s Day, with some still partying on Sydney’s Bondi beach. More spectacular scenes from Indonesia, this time in Yogyakarta. Sadiq Khan has called for resilience ahead of London’s New year fireworks show, saying the capital is “as safe as it possibly can be”. Khan said the mood on the streets was upbeat, adding that it was “really important we don’t allow terrorists to disrupt our celebrations on this New Year’s Eve”. “We’ve done everything we possibly can do to keep us safe,” he said. “We’ve got more armed police officers on duty tonight than we have on any previous year, we’ve got more visible police officers working tonight than on any previous year ... We’ve got to make sure the resilience that London is famous for is demonstrated tonight.” A huge police presence has been deployed on the streets as spectators from around the world gather to watch fireworks light up the Thames as Big Ben strikes midnight. This is Alexandra Rogers taking over the new year live blog from Marc Walker to keep you updated on celebrations across the world as they happen. Crowds gathered to watch fireworks light up the night sky behind Myanmar’s landmark Shwedagon pagoda during the New Year’s Eve celebrations. In Berlin, revellers are preparing to welcome in 2017 at a show at the Brandenburg Gate. Indonesia welcomes in the new year with a fireworks display at the Selamat Datang monument in Jakarta. An elderly lady waits for customers to snap up her New Year’s Eve party hats and masks in Yangon, Myanmar. A process of reform has been under way in the country, also known as Burma, since November 2010, when military rule was replaced by a new army-backed civilian government Celebrations are in full swing in Taipei, Taiwan, where the tourist board estimates more than 1m people have travelled to the city to marvel at the spectacle of thousands of fireworks exploding from the famous 101 skyscraper On New Year’s Eve last year, about 100 women in Cologne’s central square and other German cities were sexually assaulted. A year on and Cologne police have deployed 1,500 officers - 10 times the number of officers compared to last year. Extra security guards are also on duty to ensure the area is safe for New Year’s Eve party-goers The Press Association is reporting that paramedics are dealing with a high level of emergency calls on New Year’s Eve: Paramedics were struggling to reach patients in parts of the south-east on New Year’s Eve amid a high level of 999 calls. South East Coast ambulance service NHS foundation trust (Secamb) said 999 callers in Kent in particular were being hit by delays in crews reaching them due to the high demand. Managers said they were focusing on responding to life-threatening 999 calls as they urged people to think carefully about whether they really needed an ambulance. Secamb’s on-call gold incident commander Richard Webber said: “We are already receiving a high volume of emergency 999 calls, especially across Kent and are struggling to reach many of these in a timely manner. Our staff are already working extremely hard but this does mean that for certain emergencies, some patients can expect to wait longer for an ambulance as we focus our efforts on responding to calls which are deemed life-threatening.” During the festive period, Secamb saw a 10% rise in demand compared to last year. From 7pm on Christmas Eve to 11pm on Boxing Day it responded to 4,840 emergency calls. Last year, between 10pm on New Year’s Eve and 4am on 1 January, the trust handled 1,135 calls – an average of more than three 999 calls a minute – and this year is expected to be even higher. Webber urged people to only dial 999 in a “serious emergency” and asked them to consider other options, including the NHS 111 service. Partly in response to high call levels, it emerged this week that Secamb’s specialist critical care paramedics are being brought into the overall cover plan system to make them available to respond to all types of call. The change, revealed in a leaked memo, provoked criticism among CCPs who fear lives could be endangered by them being tied up with non-urgent calls instead of dealing with life-threatening emergencies as they have done previously. Secamb managers have defended the move, saying that with high demand and poor response times it could not continue the current model of not sending CCPs to certain categories of patient. The change will run until the end of March 2017 when it will be reviewed. Secamb, which covers Kent, Surrey, Sussex and north-east Hampshire, was put into special measures in September after the Care Quality Commission ranked it inadequate. The change is part of its recovery plan. Fears that selfie sticks would become passé in 2017 appear totally unfounded as new year partygoers in Hong Kong capture the turn of the year. Swedes see in 1 January with a nyårstårta, or new year’s cake. Here’s a trifle cake inspired by Pokémon Go. One of many being baked up and down the country this evening. Looks good ... Having completed the important diplomatic work of saluting his “many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don’t know what to do”, President-elect Donald Trump will see in the New Year with 800 guests at an “elegant and sophisticated” party at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Rather in the vein of a planned inauguration in which big names and smaller names – such as those of individual Rockettes and members of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir – have declined to perform, in the last case preferring not to be seen to endorse “tyranny and fascism”, the calibre of celebrities on the guest list seems uncertain at best. As of Saturday morning, ageing Hollywood action star Sylvester Stallone, who reportedly turned down Trump’s offer of a job with the National Endowment for the Arts, was still due to attend. The legendary music producer Quincy Jones, however, was not. In a call with reporters on Friday, incoming White House spokesman Sean Spicer mentioned the two stars as guests. Later, a spokesman for Jones – a Clinton donor – said he did not know how Spicer got that idea, as Jones would be seeing in 2017 with his family in Los Angeles. Ongoing concerns about potential conflicts of interest between President Trump and Businessman Trump have also infringed on the party. Politico reported on Friday that Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks rejected suggestions that the sale of tickets, at between $525 and $575 a head, constituted the sale of access to the president-elect and his family. “The transition is not concerned about the appearance of a conflict,” Hicks said, on the same call as Spicer. “This is an annual celebratory event at the private club, like others that have continued to occur since the election. “Additionally, the president cannot and does not have a conflict.” Some beg to differ. Koreans celebrate their day of birth but also mark growing a year older from 1 January. Feliz Año Nuevo (Happy New Year!) from Hong Kong: I am handing over to my colleague Marc Walker, who will be continuing this live blog. I would like to thank all those who have sent in their photographs and tweets, and for everyone who has commented under this article. I’ll sign off with one of my favourite pictures of the celebrations so far. Happy New Year, everyone. Beckie in Japan has just tweeted me with these lovely shots. Photo editor fail of the day goes to the Daily Express who have confused the real city of Paris for the Paris Las Vegas hotel in their article about security measures in France for tonight’s celebrations. Oops. It will be midnight in Hong Kong shortly. Strictly Come Dancing pro, Neil Jones, is there and will be enjoying the fireworks from a rooftop. A reader, Ian, is also in Hong Kong waiting for the fireworks. Meanwhile in Beijing ... What’s the best way to celebrate NYE? With pie and Prosecco. D’oh! It sounds like the Queen may have to spend at least one more day in bed as she is still recovering from her heavy cold. The monarch has not been seen in public for 11 days since she and Prince Philip sustained heavy colds, forcing them to cancel the traditional train journey to their north Norfolk estate for Christmas. Earlier this week, Buckingham Palace was forced to issue a statement confirming the Queen was still alive after a tweet from a fake BBC News account claimed she had died. Lots of people in Asia are now tweeting pictures from their New Year’s Eve celebrations. Bali looks a bit good! A bit of fun for the dying hours of 2016: Trevor Noah of The Daily Show bid farewell to the year many will care to forget. It’s already 2017 in parts of Russia. In South Korea, protesters have set off their own fireworks during a candle-lit vigil calling for the impeached president, Park Geun-hye, to step down, near the presidential house in Seoul. A Sri Lankan woman lights oil lamps as other devotees carry various offerings at a Buddhist temple on New Year’s Eve in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Lots of people in Switzerland wave goodbye to the old year by swimming in a very chilly lake. Whatever floats your boat! Do you do anything special to mark the last day of the year? Tweet me @Nicola_Slawson or send me an email: nicola.slawson@theguardian.com In Japan, New Year’s Eve is traditionally a day spent with family and although there will be fireworks over Tokyo’s Disneyland castle, the bars will remain fairly quiet. Elliot Morris decided to do something a bit different while holidaying in the capital city and went to watch a New Year’s Eve boxing match at Ota City Gym. He said: “It was fantastic and very fun. We are now just in a quiet bar.” How are you celebrating the new year? Tweet me @Nicola_Slawson or send me an email: nicola.slawson@theguardian.com. My colleague Emma Beddington has written a guide to surviving New Year’s Eve with children. Does this ring any bells? Traditionally a grave disappointment, New Year’s Eve is at least a time to cut loose and escape the suffocating, sprout-scented stranglehold of the family Christmas. But with kids, you can forget about that. You’re far too late (and broke) for babysitters. Everyone is bored, bloated, probably sick, definitely fighting and stuck with one another. How can you reach midnight without tears? Worshippers of Yemanjá ask for blessings from their deity at Copacabana – before one of the world’s largest New Year’s Eve beach parties kicks off. Brisbane just welcomed in 2017. It looks nice and tropical there, a bit different to the cold and foggy weather on this side of the world. When 2017 reaches the UK capital, thousands of police officers will provide a protective ring around the city’s set-piece fireworks display, with security tactics having been adjusted after this year’s terrorist atrocities in Europe. Armed police will also be a fixture on the capital’s tube trains as they travel between jobs – a move aimed at reassuring passengers. Fears of a mass-casualty terrorist plot targeting one of the country’s new year events have been heightened after lorries were used in devastating attacks on crowded areas in Nice and Berlin. British Transport Police (BTP) said they would be extending officers’ working hours on the night for a second year running. The BTP superintendent Andy Morgan said: “We developed and improved our security plan for last year’s New Year’s Eve event following the atrocities in Paris in the previous November and we, of course, have looked at good security, a thorough security boost following a different type of threat in Nice back in July. “In general, we have a good eyeline on what could happen, we’ve got very, very good assets both covert and overt deployed out within the footprint and across London, almost joined at the hip with our colleagues from the Metropolitan police to make sure that we’re working together to provide that security blanket across London.” Incidentally, it’s not the first time Donald Trump has thought to mention his enemies while sending good wishes on special holidays or events. Here’s a thanksgiving tweet from 2012: This was on the anniversary of 9/11 in 2013: Here’s his Father’s Day message from the following year: And one from Memorial Day in 2015: The New Year enthusiasm is at risk of being dampened here in the UK. The fog in the south has caused delays at Gatwick and Manchester, while in northern England and Wales, rain is set to sweep across areas including Manchester, Leeds and possibly Cardiff at midnight, the Met Office said. Spectacular fireworks have illuminated Sydney Harbour Bridge to celebrate the arrival of 2017 in Australia, as Britons count the hours until the new year also lands in the UK. The Pacific island nations of Samoa, Tonga and Kiribati were the first to welcome the new year as the clock hit 10am on New Year’s Eve in London. The end of 2016 was then marked in the Chatham Islands and parts of New Zealand shortly afterwards, with fireworks launched from the top of Auckland’s Sky Tower, before celebrations began in Sydney at 1pm London time. Sydney Harbour Bridge was doused in the bright light of an estimated seven tonnes of fireworks during two displays, including an earlier show which saw the landmark bridge glow purple in a tribute to the late US singer Prince. British singer David Bowie was also honoured with space-themed fireworks as a nod to the late star’s hit Space Oddity. Here’s US President-elect Donald Trump being all nice and positive as he wishes everyone a Happy New Year. Oh, wait … Sydney welcomes 2017 in with lots of loud and colourful fireworks, as per usual. Fireworks Sydney style... Happy New Year Sydney! The fireworks have started and are set to feature tributes to Prince and David Bowie. Send us your snaps! How are you spending the last day of 2016? Libby Maguire spent it exploring the Australian coast. “I did the Bondi to Coogee coastal walk to celebrate the last day of the year ... I’m now at a house party at the beach with an Aussie band playing some hits.” Do you do anything special to mark the last day of the year? Tweet me @Nicola_Slawsonor send me an email: nicola.slawson@theguardian.com In Spain it is traditional for people to eat one grape at every stroke of the midnight clock chimes on New Year’s Eve to bring luck in the following year. Some extra keen people held a warm-up session at midday in Madrid’s Puerta del Sol. Curious as to how Sydney organises its always impressive fireworks displays? Wonder no more: Safety and security is high on the agenda for New Year celebrations around the world this year: I love this photograph of a passenger plane flying in front of a rainbow during New Year’s Eve celebrations in Taipei, Taiwan. This year’s celebration in the city will use fireworks combined with a light show for the first time, with an estimated cost of TW$45m (£1.1m). A Guardian reader in Taiwan also sent us this photograph of her family’s New Year’s Eve feast. Laura Pepper Wu said: “We are celebrating our baby’s first NYE with a dim sum dinner here in Taiwan! Happy New Year!” How are you celebrating the new year? Tweet me @Nicola_Slawson or send me an email: nicola.slawson@theguardian.com More pretty pictures from down under courtesy of ABC News Australia: While most people are gathering to ring in the new year, in South Korea people have once again gathered in protest. Even on New Year’s Eve, large crowds of protesters have turned out in Seoul to demand the resignation of the impeached President Park Geun-hye, who is determined to restore her powers through a court trial. South Korea isn’t the only country to have celebrations dampened by national events. Normally boisterous Bangkok will see in the new year on a more sombre note, with prayers and candles replacing parties as the nation grieves for King Bhumibol Adulyadej who died in October. With Brazil mired in its worst recession in a century, the fireworks there have been cut to just 12 minutes as the state government fights bankruptcy. However, up to 2 million people are still expected to party on Rio’s Copacabana beach. Security concerns have hit many new year events this year, with many cities opting to set up truck blockades as a new tactic to try to prevent vehicles ploughing into crowds, as happened in Berlin and Nice this year. While Sydney is using garbage trucks as safety barriers, the German capital has beefed up security after the 19 December attack, deploying hundreds more police, some armed with machine-guns. “This year, what’s new is that we will place concrete blocks and position heavy armoured vehicles at the entrances” to the zone around Brandenburg Gate, a police spokesman said. In Cologne, aftersexual attacks during New Year’s Eve events last year, 1,800 police will be deployed, compared with just 140 in 2015. In neighbouring Austria, police will hand out 6,000 free pocket alarms to help prevent assaults on women. In Paris, there will be a full fireworks display again, after 2015 celebrations were muted following the massacre of 130 people on 13 November of that year. Nearly 100,000 police, gendarmes and soldiers will be deployed across France against the terrorist threat. With more than a million people expected to turn up to watch the ball drop in Times Square, New York is deploying 165 “blocker” trucks and about 7,000 police. Rome has organised armoured vehicles and a greater numbers of security forces around the Coliseum and at St Peter’s Square where Pope Francis will celebrate midnight mass. In Moscow, police will deploy more than 5,000 officers, backed by thousands more from the new national guard and volunteer militia, to maintain order. Thousands traditionally gather in Red Square, but for the second year in a row, the area will be open solely to 6,000 invitees. In London, 3,000 officers will be on patrol among crowds lining the banks of the river Thames to watch the fireworks over the London Eye. In case you’re confused, Sydney has two sets of fireworks – one at 9pm (for families who don’t want to be out too late), and the other at midnight proper, which falls at 1pm GMT. Here’s a time lapse of the 9pm fireworks, boiled down to a mere 16 seconds by Mike Bowers, Guardian Australia’s photographer-at-large: Does anyone else think the Sky Tower in Auckland looks like a bit like a pineapple in this stunning shot? Many of us can’t wait for 2016 to be over, but did you know that we are going to have to endure an entire extra second of it? The National Physical Laboratory (NPL) is to introduce a “leap second” after 23.59:59 on 31 December. As a result, clocks striking 00:00:00 will actually be recording a time of 23:59:60 – delaying midnight by a second. It will be the 27th time the NPL has brought in a leap second to ensure that time based on the Earth’s rotation does not lag behind time kept by atomic clocks. Read more about that here: Shame about the lack of capital letters in this tweet from the City of Sydney, but it’s more about the picture of course ... The celebrations in Sydney have already kicked off with a children’s fireworks display. Tell us how you are celebrating in your part of the world. A hop and skip over the Tasman Sea and Australia is gearing up for its famous new year celebrations in Sydney and will be defying the increased terror threat. About 1.5 million people are packing Australia’s biggest city to watch the midnight fireworks, a larger-than-usual crowd due to the weekend timing and warm weather, as the New South Wales state premier urged “business as usual”. “My encouragement to everyone is to enjoy New Year’s Eve … in the knowledge that police are doing everything they can to keep us safe,” Mike Baird said. The year of 2016 has seen repeated bloodshed around the world, most recently a deadly truck attack at a Berlin Christmas market, as well as a similar incident on Bastille Day in France that killed 86, as well as atrocities in Turkey and the Middle East, and the war in Syria. About 2,000 extra officers have been deployed in Sydney after a man was arrested for allegedly making threats online about the celebrations. There were a number of other reported threats this holiday period, in the Asia-Pacific region and elsewhere. In Melbourne, police said they foiled a “significant” Islamic State-inspired Christmas Day terrorism plot. Indonesia said it had foiled plans by an Isis-linked group for a Christmas suicide bombing, and 52 died in the Philippines in bomb attacks blamed on Islamist militants. Israel on Friday issued a warning of imminent “terrorist attacks” on tourists and western targets in India, telling its citizens to avoid public places. Only a couple of minutes to go until midnight in New Zealand. How are you celebrating? Tweet me @nicola_slawson and let me know.

For those desperate to see the back of 2016, the good news is it is already 2017 in Samoa!','https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/live/2016/dec/31/new-years-eve-around-the-world-2016-2017-live','New year celebrations around the world – as it happened',182,'lifeandstyle'),('commentisfree/2017/jan/01/john-kerry-netanyahu-israel-palestinians','Early in his major foreign policy speech last Wednesday about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, US secretary of state John Kerry promised to tell some “uncomfortable truths”. He certainly did that. But here’s the key question: for jaded Israelis almost defiantly committed to political stagnation, will it matter? Kerry started on well-worn paths: Israel cannot remain Jewish and democratic without reaching a two-state solution and the window is closing; the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, cannot claim to support two states and continue expanding settlements; the Palestinian leadership poisons peace by glorifying violence. America under Obama was overwhelmingly committed to Israeli military and security needs and it allowed the UN security council resolution 2334, condemning settlements, for Israel’s own good. Lastly, he reiterated the long-standing core principles of the two state solution. For an Israeli audience– and the speech felt squarely aimed at them – those themes aren’t new. In fact, they are axiomatic and, increasingly, transparent. Israelis appear to have put up a psychological separation barrier: the world warns that the conflict will ruin their lives, but, day to day, they feel that things are going fine. In this narrative, outsiders criticise Israeli policy because “the world” is out to get Israel. Netanyahu is in perfect symbiosis with this approach. He has long positioned himself as the man who speaks Israel’s truth to global power. He has been elected four times: his strategy works. Perhaps Kerry’s speech can’t dent such armour. But there were other uncomfortable truths in the speech, less commonly heard by Israelis. First, Kerry displayed surprising knowledge of what occupation means on the ground. In rare detail, he noted that no Palestinian can get a permit to build in Area C (60% of the West Bank); that over the last two years Israel has destroyed structures, leaving 1,300 people homeless, as settlements grow, outside the large blocs and east of the wall. He told about business people who can’t move their goods, Palestinian roads that can’t connect, children in Gaza playing in rubble.He observed that Israel’s settlements in the Jordan Valley and other calculated locations are chopping any Palestinian state into pieces. If Israelis even know these facts – not a given – they have implicitly presumed that outsiders don’t. Or that they won’t do anything about it. A second unusual point was Kerry’s explanation of why all settlement expansion, including in large blocs adjacent to Israel, is bad for peace: these are unilateral moves. It was a not-so-subtle jab at Netanyahu’s mantra accusing the Palestinians of unilateral action in international forums, one of the latters’ justifications for rejecting peace talks. In another striking moment, Kerry began to sketch out the dystopian spectre of endless occupation: “If the occupation becomes permanent, [the Palestinian Authority] could dissolve and turn over all administrative and security responsibilities to the Israelis… who would administer the schools and hospitals? Does Israel want to pay for the billions of dollars of lost international assistance?” With these hard and less hackneyed truths, Kerry may have cracked the brittle shell of some of Netanyahu’s own axioms. For example, Netanyahu conveys to Israelis that conflict management is sustainable because he can hold off global pressure and sell good-image stories about Israel. Kerry’s speech showed that outsiders look past the screen and see the occupation clearly. Netanyahu has argued that Israel need not negotiate if the Palestinians take unfair unilateral action; Kerry exposed the fact that Israel’s “status quo” is just as much unilateral action. While Netanyahu lulls his public with the implicit notion that the two-state solution will wait until Israel deems the conditions ripe, Kerry illustrated that in reality it is almost already gone. Obama and Kerry will be gone first, of course. For the next few weeks, Israelis can tell themselves that President-elect Trump will be a better friend; that Theresa May distanced herself from Kerry’s speech and may want to co-operate with Trump on Israel, making a strong triangular alliance. But remember that resolution 2334 passed with the UK’s “yea” – a stronger statement than the US abstention. And the new chums Netanyahu has been cultivating – China and Russiato show the West his independence, – abandoned Israel in the vote as well. Israelis may eventually have to ask themselves if Netanyahu is telling the truth – about any of it. The speech may cause Israelis to inch towards the conclusion that he’s not and that his so-called stagnation on conflict resolution is making the two-state solution all but obsolete. At that point, as tepid as they were about two states, Israelis will confront a menu of options that are less familiar, some of them far less appealing. What are they? One is the scenario Kerry described. It is the logical extension of political stasis, combined with the continuing creep of the Israel Defence Forces and settlements in the West Bank and a locked-down, festering Gaza. The developments are easily visualised: the PA collapses in strife or rebellion and the Israeli army ends up governing. A war breaks out in Gaza; this time, Israel could follow through on threats made in the 2014 war to reoccupy the Strip, which sounded like outlying extemist voices then. For anyone who remembers the pre-Oslo years when Israeli soldiers patrolled the muddy streets of Gazalike target practice for Molotov cocktails, this is a disaster. The next option is the rosy, rightwing panacea for all things of late: annexation of the West Bank, what the right calls Judea and Samaria. Once, this was not said in polite company; today, Israel’s education minister and deputy foreign minister call proudly for Israeli sovereignty in part or all of the territory. How they think fortress-like, exclusive settlements of Jewish Israelis will harmoniously co-exist with dismembered Palestinian communities living under bastardised autonomy with no incentive for co-operation with Israel is unclear. The ensuing anger will inevitably be met with matching levels of violence. One equal, democratic binational or civic-identity state is sometimes mentioned as an option; it is a non-starter. Large majorities on both sides reject it in polls. Israel will never give full voting rights to a population similar in size to the Jewish public. The last feasible option is a mix of separation and integration. This refers to federation or confederation – see the Cyprus peace plans (not yet realised), post-war Bosnia or even the EU. The separation element acknowledges two national groups with defined territories. “Integration” is more of an acknowledgement that borders must be made porous to relax the suffocation of Palestinian movement and livelihood; that natural resources in a tiny land require joint management; that neighbourhoods and economies are so intertwined that surgical separation could kill the patient. For a long time, Israelis wanted to agree with Netanyahu and believed that represssing the problem would make it go away. One speech won’t change that overnight, but it may be a clarifying moment that certain truths can only be ignored for so long. Then, one of the options on the menu will happen either way.

The continent drifts in a north-north-east direction at rate of 7cm a year. But, from this year, its recorded latitude and longitude will move 1.8 metres – a scheduled update to the local coordinate system to reflect the movement of the Earth’s tectonic plates. The transition to the new datum, overseen by Geoscience Australia, will be gradual over the next two years. But for the 10,000 or so Australians who use coordinates for geocaching, it has sparked much discussion. Geocaching began in the early 2000s as a sort of real-world treasure hunt, or high-tech orienteering, in which players hunt for registered “caches” hidden and recorded by other players. The cache itself is a box, often a reusable food container, though the only requirement is that it is watertight and large enough to hold a logbook. A player hides it and records its location with enough detail for it to be found by another player, who will then take something out of the box and replace it with an item of equal or greater value. James Finger, a forensic scientist and president of Geocaching NSW, says it combines “bushwalking and geeky technology”. “The old axiom is ‘Geocachers: We use multi-billion dollar satellite technology to hunt for boxes in the bush. What’s your hobby?’” Since 2009, he has made about 5,800 finds, which he says puts him “at about the middle of anyone who’s taking it seriously”. He managed just over 400 this year, but backpacking through Europe “in a previous life”, he racked up a streak of more than 1,000 days. With between six and eight million players (and 2.8 million caches) registered around the world, the game has grown as the technology has become more accessible. In 2000, a top-of-the-line, over-the-counter GPS unit could take a player to within 20m of the hidden cache, Finger says. “But now your new smartphones have got comparable accuracy – if you know how to use them – with a basic bushwalkers’ unit. That’s what’s spurred the popularity. You no longer have to buy a dedicated piece of kit, you can do it on your smartphone.” Though the change of Australia’s latitude and longitude has “sparked some conversation amongst the community”, he says it will have little impact on geocachers, who use the global World Geodetic System – not the Australian datum. When GPS systems on most web-enabled smartphones, such as Apple maps or Google maps, take you to between 10-20m from the cache – “so a 1.8m shift is not really significant” anyway. Finding a cache also depends on the accuracy of the coordinates recorded by the person who hid it – which could be as much as 30m out from its true location, depending on factors such as nearby buildings or power lines that might have compounded the reading. “When the numbers on your screen say you’re about 10m away, you generally put this thing away in your pocket, and you start looking around, and you rely on your own experience and intuition,” Finger says. The game has changed in the best part of two decades, he says: with most players introduced to geocaching through their smartphones, its links to orienteering skills and geographic systems have become more nebulous. Discussion of the technology involved – even of latitude and longitude – is more interesting for “the old guard”. “Your modern generation of geocachers may not know there is such a thing as a dedicated GPS handheld device,” he says. “It’s like trying to explain to your kids the days when mobile phones did not have the internet.” Most geocachers simply interact with the game at face value, as they would Pokémon Go, to which it’s often compared. (“Except it’s been around 15 years. It’s as old as the original Pokémon games are, in fact.”) Finger predicts that games and interests incorporating GPS technology will only increase. “It’s basically a free thing for the public and game developers to utilise, and it’s one the average person is now familiar with and comfortable with. “Nearly everyone who owns a smartphone will use Google maps: they know what it is, they know vaguely what it can do for them. Turning that into a hobby or interest is not as massive a step as it was to those first bushwalkers who were told to trust instructions to find a hidden box.” This article was corrected on 3 January to distinguish between Geocentric Datum of Australia, which is changing, and the World Geodetic System, which is not','https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/01/geocaching-gps-treasure-hunt-on-shifting-ground-as-australia-changes-coordinates','Geocaching: GPS treasure hunt on shifting ground as Australia changes coordinates',184,'technology'),('business/2017/jan/01/alan-joyce-among-qantas-passengers-stranded-in-dubai-but-not-for-long','Eighty passengers remain stranded in Dubai, forced to celebrate New Years Eve in transit rather than in Sydney after their flight from London was delayed. Among the hundreds affected by the delay on Friday was Qantas CEO Alan Joyce. While some passengers have been left waiting for two days, Joyce managed to get the first available flight to Sydney and made it back in time for the new year. A routine fuel stop at Dubai international airport for the A380 QF2 turned into a lengthy delay after a technical fault was discovered on the aircraft. Joyce was on that flight. Passengers who flew in on the next flight from London headed for Sydney were then bumped off their flight, and the stranded passengers, including Joyce, took that flight back to Sydney. A Qantas spokeswoman told Guardian Australia that this was a part of routine procedure when delays occurred, and that there had been no special accommodations made for Joyce. “When there are delays the first group of people who have been through delays get on the first available flight,” she said. The almost 500 passengers originally booked on the flight were offered accommodation in Dubai. There were 80 passengers left in Dubai still waiting for an alternative flight, the spokeswoman said. However, passengers were unimpressed, posting about their frustration with the airline on social media. One passenger, Mia Parkes-Talbot, wrote on the airline’s Facebook page: “Please think about the pregnant women, babies and people trying to get home to their families this new year. I hope you have a terrible 2017.” Earlier, Parkes-Talbot posted: “Please can you send some staff to talk to passengers of the QF2 flight? While we have been delayed for 8 hours now we haven’t seen a single qantas staff member.” She claimed that passengers had been told there were delays because of fog. Another passenger, Graham Dobson, posted on Twitter that there was “total chaos” at the airport.','https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/01/alan-joyce-among-qantas-passengers-stranded-in-dubai-but-not-for-long','Alan Joyce among Qantas passengers stranded in Dubai – but not for long',185,'business'),('football/2017/jan/01/chelseas-diego-costa-to-move-to-chinese-super-league-for-80m','Oi Oi! You laaaaaacky people! It’s the Mill bringing you transfer rumours hotter than that burn you’ve got between the temples that makes reading this seem like a particularly sadistic form of torture. That’s right, the Mill is starting the year as it certainly will not go on and working on a weekend. And on the day the January transfer window FLINGS open no less. Woop! It’s 2017 and it would appear that José Mourinho has his mojo back. United are back to their old selves – that is if you believe Usain Bolt – and so is Mou. He’s told Anthony Martial in no uncertain terms to stop listening to his agent and start listening to him. He’s also plotting a £145m raid of Atlético Madrid for both Antoine Griezmann and Saúl Ñíguez. It gets worse for Atlético. Arsène Wenger will not be replacing Diego Simeone in the dugout because, well he just doesn’t want to. He’s much more interested in sticking with the Gunners and has his sights firmly on Control + Paste’s Red Bull Salzburg’s Dayotchanculle Upamecano. He’ll face competition from Barcelona on that front though, but both may be trumped by RB Leipzig, what with the Red Bull connection ‘n’ all. Should Wenger fail, he’ll turn his attentions to Oghenekaro Etebo of Nigeria who banged in four goals against Japan at the Olympics way back when in 2016. Leicester are the competition in this instance. Sticking at Arsenal and Borussia Dortmund are after Gedion Zelalem, the German-born USA soccerballer who went on loan to Rangers. Chinese Super League news for you now. Nope, nothing doing on the Mark Clattenburg front, alas, but Diego Costa is wanted by Tianjin Quanjian, managed by Fabio Cannavaro, of course, and they’re willing to line Chelsea’s already bulging pockets with £80m big ones. Axel Witsel also looks set for a move to Shanghai SIPG where he will sleep on piles of cash by night and dovetail with Oscar in midfield by day. Witsel was going to go to Juventus but, well, he’s not going to do that any more. At the moment Virgil van Dijk is hotter than that burning sensation the Mill was talking about earlier. The Mill isn’t convinced but onwards and upwards. That’s what Ronald Koeman reckons anyway because he’s trying to pinch the £50m man from under the noses of Manchester City and Chelsea. File that one under ambitious. A more likely move to Merseyside beckons for Joe Hart though, whose Turin adventure is coming to a close. He wants to go to Liverpool. Badly. Whether Jürgen Klopp will have him remains to be seen. And in non-transfer non-news James Rodríguez isn’t leaving Real Madrid, according to his old man, and Andrés Iniesta says he wants to stay at Barcelona for the rest of time.

It will be just like 2016. Only more so. This will be the year in which Donald Trump formally enters the White House, and Theresa May (probably) begins Brexit negotiations. It will be the year in which elections in Germany, the Netherlands and France, and possibly Italy, are likely to see rightwing populists gain ground, even triumph. In the Netherlands, Geert Wilders’s anti-Muslim, anti-immigration Party for Freedom(PVV) leads the polls and may help form the government in March. In France, in May, Marine Le Pen of the far-right Front National should reach at least the second-round run-off in the presidential election and may even win. In Germany, Angela Merkel could hang on as chancellor after September’s vote, but the far-right AfD will almost certainly have dozens of Bundestag seats. And, so, 2017 will also be the year when fears for the future of liberal democracy will reach a new pitch. Such fears will, however, be only half-justified. Democracy is in rude health. It is liberalism that is in trouble. Democracy does not require that the “right” result be delivered every time. The whole point of the democratic process is that it is unpredictable. The reason we need democracy is that the question of what are “right” policies or who is the “right” candidate is often fiercely contested. Donald Trump or Le Pen may be reactionary, and their policies may help unpick the threads of liberal tolerance, but their success reveals a problem with politics, not democracy. We have become so accustomed to talking about “liberal democracy” that we often forget that there is an inherent tension between liberalism and democracy. At the heart of liberalism stands the individual. Classically, liberals held that any official restraint placed on an individual’s liberty had to be both justified and minimal. Liberals, however, also fear the masses, worrying about “mob rule” and the “tyranny of the majority” as threats to the liberty of the individual. For all the distaste for state restraints, many liberals have increasingly looked to state institutions as means of checking the power of the many. This has inevitably led to ambivalence about the virtues of democracy. With the end of the Cold War, many liberals expected the tension between liberalism and democracy to be resolved. Liberal institutions, they imagined, could concentrate on governance and the enactment of the “right” policies while, freed from dreams of socialism, the masses could simply become the electorate, exercising their democratic right at elections and enjoying the benefits of technocratically shaped governments. In fact, the opposite has happened. The tension between liberalism and democracy has become far sharper. Many liberals insist that the only way of defending liberal values is by insulating them from the democratic process. Many who feel politically voiceless in this new world believe they can only assert their democratic voice by challenging liberal values. It is this polarisation between liberalism and democracy that created the tumult of 2016 and will create the even greater tumult of 2017. Democracy is not just about placing a cross on a ballot paper. It is fundamentally about the contestation of power. We might vote as individuals in the privacy of the polling booth, but we can only defend democracy and assert our political voice by acting collectively. This requires a robust public sphere and a democracy that is contested as much in the streets and the workplace as in the polling station. The erosion of the power of labour organisations and social movements has helped undermine democracy in this broader sense. At the same time, the decline of these organisations has encouraged a shift in power away from democratic institutions, such as national parliaments, to non-political institutions such as international courts and central banks. Many liberals view this as ensuring good governance and protecting important policies from the vagaries of the democratic process. Many on the left, no longer rooted in old-style class politics, have welcomed this shift, seeing transnational organisations, such as the EU, as key vehicles for social change. Many sections of the public, however, have been left feeling that they have no political voice. Having lost their traditional means of venting disaffection, and in an age in which class politics has little meaning, many working-class voters have come to express themselves through the language of identity politics; not the identity politics of the left, but that of the right, the politics of nationalism and xenophobia, that provides the fuel for many populist movements. Critics of liberalism have long recognised that its fundamental flaw is that humans do not live merely as individuals. We are social beings and find our individuality and discover meaning only through others. Hence the importance to political life not just of individuals but also of communities and collectives. Politically, the sense of the collective has been expressed in two broad forms: the politics of identity and the politics of solidarity. The former stresses attachment to common identities based on such categories as race, nation, gender or culture. The latter draws people into a collective, not because of a given identity but to further a political or social goal. Where the politics of identity divides, the politics of solidarity finds collective purpose across the fissures of race or gender, culture or nation. But it is the politics of solidarity that has crumbled over the past two decades as the left has declined. For many, the only form of collective politics left is that rooted in identity. Hence the rise of identity-based populist movements. Such movements often link a reactionary politics of identity to economic and social policies that were once a staple of the left: defence of jobs, support for the welfare state, opposition to austerity. Consider next year’s French presidential elections. The two candidates likely to make it through to the second round are the centre-right François Fillon and the far-right Marine Le Pen. Fillon is socially conservative and economically “liberal”. He wants to crush what remains of the French “social model”, cutting state expenditure and slashing workers’ rights. It is Le Pen who poses as the champion of the working class, hostile to austerity and supportive of the welfare state. Populists pose, too, as champions of liberties and freedoms. Wilders was found guilty of “inciting discrimination” by asking a crowd of supporters whether they want “more or fewer Moroccans” in the Netherlands. Rather than challenge his bigotry politically, liberals are content to damn it legally, allowing Wilders to promote himself as a martyr for free speech, despite his deeply illiberal views, including the demand that the Qur’an be banned.Figures such as Le Pen and Wilders have marched on to the terrain, and speak to the constituencies, that the left has abandoned. The failure of the left to defend popular sovereignty has enabled the far-right to frame such sovereignty not in terms of the politics of solidarity, but in the language of nationalism and bigotry. The polarisation of liberalism and democracy shows how the fundamental aspects of a progressive outlook have been ripped apart. Those who rightly bemoan the corrosion of collective movements and a sense of community often see the problem as too much immigration or too great a stress on individual freedoms. Those who take a liberal view on immigration, and on other social issues, are often happy with a more atomised society. Until we find a way of establishing a new politics of solidarity that links liberal ideas about individual rights and freedom, including freedom of movement, with progressive economic arguments and a belief in the community and the collective, we may welcome 2018 in the same fashion as we now welcome 2017, only more so.

Now meet 2017, his wilder sister. This is the year that Brexit turns from conjecture into trajectory. The process of departure will start to happen when Mrs May delivers her “Dear Jean” letter to the EU, the piece of paper that formally notifies the commission that Britain wants a divorce. It is conceivable that this could be delayed by the verdict on the parliamentary process that the Supreme Court will deliver later this month. But Article 50 is going to be triggered in the next 12 months, with consequences that the best minds in politics, diplomacy and trade can only guess at. Before that, in less than three weeks’ time, Donald Trump gets his fat fingers on the nuclear biscuit. One of the most inexperienced and erratic personalities ever to occupy the Oval Office – and that’s the PG version of his character – will take office at a time of severe geopolitical turbulence. The agonies of Syria are part of a wider proxy war in the Middle East in which Russia, Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states are all participants. North Korea has nuclear warheads and ambitions to be able to land one on mainland United States. As if that wasn’t a sufficiency of unpredictability, there will be critical elections in Germany and France, the EU’s two most significant actors. Voters in the Netherlands and probably Italy will also have an opportunity to join the insurrection against the status quo that delivered the Brexit vote and the Trumpquake. In the most apocalyptic scenario for Europe, the eurozone begins to disintegrate, followed soon afterwards by the EU itself. The conventional wisdom still maintains that this won’t happen because Marine Le Pen will be defeated in the final round of voting for the presidency of France. The consensus view also tips Angela Merkel to receive a favourable answer when she seeks a fourth term from German voters. Optimists will be expecting to arrive at the end of 2017 to find columnists debating the unexpected resilience of European liberal democracy and pronouncing that we have passed “peak populism”. This is likelier to be the case if the nasty economic side-effects of Brexit become palpable to Britons and President Trump starts to get unpopular with those who put him in office. He is already unpopular with the larger number of Americans who never wanted him in the White House. Whether your forecast of the future leans to the optimistic or the pessimistic probably says more about your personality than it does about what is going to happen. Let’s be honest. No one should be terribly confident that they know anything after a 2016 that confounded the expectations of pundits, pollsters, financial markets and the voters themselves. The only truly robust prediction that I make about 2017 is that sensible people are going to be a lot more cautious about making predictions. Pundits have been marking the turn of the year by listing their forecasting turkeys. Pollsters are conducting another round of postmortems about what went wrong for them. Mainstream politicians are agonising about the lessons to be learned from their failures. There is one exception to this nervousness. Stock markets, especially those in London and New York, are celebrating. While most of us look anxiously upon stormy waters, markets apparently see only tranquil seas ahead. The FTSE-100 ended the year at a new high. The US indices have been anticipating President Trump by surging to record levels. A most remarkable signal is coming from the VIX Index, sometimes called the “Fear Index” because it is a gauge of how much investors are prepared to pay to insure themselves against shocks. The hoariest of the cliches about financial markets is that they hate uncertainty. Yet we begin a year pregnant with perils with the Fear Index at exceptionally low levels. Stock markets are not buoyant because they have a superior window into the future. Their predictive powers were among the most useless in 2016. Markets bet that Hillary Clinton would become the 45th president of the United States. The night of the Brexit referendum began with the value of sterling rising against the dollar, so convinced were most traders that Britons would vote to stick with the EU. When these “unthinkables” then happened, markets responded with an instant panic plunge before bouncing back. The “Trump trade” powering Wall Street is based on an assumption that he will do all of the semi-sensible things he has suggested to boost the US economy, while fulfilling none of the reckless campaign promises that would derail it. Share prices are also being driven by salivation that he will deliver the lavish tax breaks he promised corporate America. A man who ran against Wall Street – and painted his opponent as a creature of the financial elite – is now being loved by Wall Street. It is not a coincidence, as old Marxists used to say, that his proposed cuts to personal taxation would shower cash on the already wealthy. You will have spotted the contradiction between what markets expect and what he promised. He secured the White House by harvesting the discontent of working and middle-class Americans, whose living standards have fallen or been frozen in the past decade. Theresa May finds herself in Number 10 for not dissimilar reasons. Many Britons used the Brexit vote to express their anger that the economy was not working for them. There are myriad accounts of why large segments of the electorate in many developed democracies are rebelling against the status quo. Nearly all place economic grievances at the heart of it. More sophisticated accounts recognise other factors. Discontent about levels of migration. Distrust of mainstream politicians. Fear of terrorism. A reaction against the cosmopolitan complexity of the early 21st century. The inability of lacklustre centrists to find a vision or language that could compete with the potency of cheap tunes such as “Take Back Control!” and “Make America Great Again!” There are many sources of what I have called the Age of Rage, but the other discontents are entangled with or sharpened by the fundamental one. People feel worse off. Since the financial crisis, the most important fact of political life has been anaemic growth in most western countries, accompanied by wages that have stagnated, declined or improved only feebly for millions. This discontent has spread to quite a lot of those who have actually done OK since the Great Crash of 2007-09. They have nevertheless felt worse off, because the rewards of prosperity have been disproportionately and conspicuously enjoyed by the very top slice of society. There are many ways of dissecting the Brexit vote, but the starkest is by income. In every income group in Britain bar the most affluent ABs, there was a majority for leaving the EU. Donald Trump would not have acquired the White House had not an important section of the working-class vote withheld its support from his opponent or transferred it to him. The biggest shift of ex-Obama voters to Trump came among those earning less than $30,000 – £24,000 – a year. Theresa May says she gets it: the fruits of prosperity have not been equitably divided. She has spent a lot of the time since she moved into Number 10 talking about the reform of capitalism. “A change is going to come,” she declared at the Tory party conference. In a more recent speech, to the City at Mansion House, she defined her task as ensuring that the profits from globalisation were spread more widely and fairly. She put herself on the side of “people on modest to low incomes in rich countries like our own” who “see their jobs being outsourced and their wages undercut”. That echoed Donald Trump when he used his victory speech to acclaim what he called “the forgotten men and women of our country” and vowed that his presidency would ensure that they “will be forgotten no longer”. In both cases, the implied promise is that there will be a reordering of the distribution of profits. Those who own and manage assets will be obliged to take a diminished share so that a greater slice of the rewards can be enjoyed by workers. What are stock markets telling us when they respond to Mr Trump and Mrs May by sending share prices to record highs? They are telling us that they think that the British prime minister is a phoney and the incoming American president is a conman. They are wagering that President Trump will betray the poorer voters who helped put him in the White House. They are betting that Theresa May will not deliver for the less affluent Britons whose Brexit votes helped elevate her to Number 10. That’s what the cash is saying. The “forgotten men and women” of America will be no better remembered in the Trump cabinet of tycoons. Mrs May’s “just about managing” will find out she is all jam tomorrow, never today. The money temples are almost certainly right in their assessment of Donald Trump. Theresa May has the coming year to try to prove the markets wrong about her.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/01/surging-stock-markets-donald-trump-conman-theresa-may-phoney','Surging stock markets say Trump is a conman and May a phoney | Andrew Rawnsley',189,'commentisfree'),('culture/2017/jan/01/debbie-reynolds-carrie-fisher-hollywood-mother-daughter-bright-lights-documentary','In a modest screening room on the Côte d’Azur last spring, the curtains went up on what were to prove the last scenes of a great Hollywood mother-and-daughter saga. An intrigued audience at the Cannes film festival joined Carrie Fisher, fragile in a black cocktail dress and accompanied by her French bulldog, Gary, for the world premiere of a documentary called Bright Lights. Largely shot in the privileged enclave of Beverly Hills, the film is the true-life story of coping with a celebrity parent and with the legacy of stardom. It is also a story that only really ended last week with the unexpected deaths of its two leading ladies: Fisher, 60, and her mother Debbie Reynolds, 84. Bright Lights: Starring Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher will now be shown by US cable television channel HBO this Saturday, as a fitting memorial to the wit and endurance of a mother-and-daughter showbiz team initially seen singing together on stage in the late 1960s, when the young and increasingly reluctant Fisher had a guest spot in her mother’s cabaret show. The documentary revolves around a series of interviews, interspersed with Hollywood newsreel footage and home movie sequences, and it offers a glimpse of the eccentric domestic life Fisher latterly shared with Reynolds inside a luxury compound once owned by Bette Davis. The Star Wars actor’s friend, Fisher Stevens, had originally agreed to direct the film, alongside his wife, Alexis Bloom, with the intention of showing the public how affectionately dependent the pair of warring relatives had grown. But as filming progressed last year it became clear that both actors were revealing a side of themselves that had never been seen before. It also became clear that both faced tough daily health challenges. “We didn’t know it was going to get that dark,” admitted Stevens at a reception for the film. “That’s the beauty of documentary film-making, that you don’t know where your movie is going. But there were times when we had to turn off the cameras.” Now the film has a permanent valedictory note. The public was always startled by the fact the young woman who found fame playing Kathy Selden in Singin’ in the Rain opposite Gene Kelly in 1952 should be the mother of the young woman who in 1977 found fame playing Princess Leia in a space opera. The notion that star talent, or at least charisma, can be passed down the generations is particularly potent when it concerns Hollywood’s female firmament. Liza Minnelli is still regarded as her mother Judy Garland’s representative on Earth and Melanie Griffith is judged of interest partly for just being the daughter of Tippi Hedren. The status of Hollywood royalty was almost automatically conferred upon them. And just as Minnelli once recalled a childhood spent watching spellbound from the top of the stairs as her mother performed songs at the piano for her dinner guests in the 1940s, so Fisher’s childhood was dominated by admiration for her mother: a well-known photograph taken by Lawrence Schiller in 1963 shows the six-year-old Carrie standing in the wings of a theatre, mesmerised by Reynolds’s performance on stage. “Walking down the street with her was like being in a parade,” Fisher once said. “I had to share her. She belonged to everybody.” Even before the 1978 publication of Christina Crawford’s book Mommie Dearest, with its allegations of cruelty at the hands of her celebrated mother, Joan Crawford, the idea that the excesses of stardom were incompatible with motherhood was a favourite trope of celebrity gossip columns. Nowadays some of us might feel guilty for staring, rather as if we are passengers on one of those “homes of the stars” bus tours, but it is hard to pass by the Reynolds/Fisher epic without gawping a little. There is so much to see. First, there is the all-American drama of a high school beauty pageant winner who is plucked from nowhere for Hollywood grooming and becomes a sensation in one of the most famous musical films ever made. Then comes Reynolds’s marriage to Eddie Fisher, at the time on a par with Frank Sinatra as a swoonable crooner. Next up is his scandalous, marriage-wrecking affair with the beautiful widow next door, who just happens to be Elizabeth Taylor. Then along comes youthful Carrie, and before we know about her drug addiction and mental health struggles, she is established in an unrivalled position in the solar system as a sci-fi princess in the film that “saved cinema”. She goes on to have love affairs with Harrison Ford, Dan Ackroyd and Paul Simon, before developing a writing career and appearing in classics such as The Blues Brothers and When Harry Met Sally. The head of documentaries at HBO described Bright Lights as “a love story” in a recent interview with Variety. But the nuances of the dynamic between the two stars are exposed in the film. They are also evident in comments made last week by Carrie’s younger brother, Todd. After the death he told press that his octogenarian mother had been lost “without having Carrie to look after”. The documentary shows Fisher trekking back and forth up the path to her mother’s home, where Reynolds awaits the cameras with full blow-dry and make-up. At one point they share a souffle with Gary the dog. Yet the shared intimacies of the documentary are not the only justification for public interest in the private lives of these women. In 1987 Fisher wrote a thinly disguised novel about her conflict with her mother. Postcards from the Edge was made into a successful film directed by Mike Nichols and starring Meryl Streep and Shirley MacLaine. As a result of this portrayal, many assumed their feud had raged on. Not so. Although Fisher refused to see her mother for about a decade after she made Star Wars, their fondness for each other won through. As Frank Bruni wrote in the New York Times this weekend, they lived side-by-side in a state of truce. “This proximity clearly rattled [Fisher], but it reassured her, too. It was equal parts intimidation and consolation – in other words, motherhood itself.” The new film revolves around Reynolds’s determination to keep performing and Fisher’s equal determination to protect her mother and see her hopes fulfilled. In what turned out to be Reynolds’s last two shows, first in Connecticut, and then in Las Vegas, we watch her powers diminish. Most poignant of all, however, is the aftermath of her failure to set up a museum in Hollywood for the wealth of studio memorabilia she had built up, including Monroe’s subway grate dress and a pair of ruby slippers from The Wizard of Oz. The collection was eventually sold off at auction to pay off debts. Perhaps nearly as moving is the moment when Fisher joins her mother for one final time on stage at Vegas. During scenes shot in London, where Fisher has travelled to appear in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, we see the personal trainer foisted upon her by Lucasfilm, the production company. Asked if she keeps in touch with co-stars Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill, Fisher replies sarcastically that they run into each other at the “celebrity cafe” where “we all just look more melted”. In an interview with the Guardian last year, Fisher confessed that her next meeting with Ford would cost her a blush or two. She had just published The Princess Diarist, a book which candidly chronicled their short affair. It was, she said, one of the most intense moments of her life and Ford had influenced her future relationships, steering her towards Simon, whom she dated for several years either side of an 11-month marriage. “Paul was much more verbal. But there was something very diffident again. He was the same amount older. I was 21 and Paul was 36. They were both very cerebral and serious. And they were witty, which is different from being funny.” For his part, Harrison is quoted as once telling Fisher: “You have the eyes of a doe and the balls of a samurai.” Key to her character was a need to make people laugh. Her book recalls her joy at managing to amuse Ford with her impersonation of him early in their affair. In the film Fisher also talks about her childhood efforts to keep her errant father inside the family home by entertaining him. The scene in the documentary where she visits the 82-year-old singer in hospital in a halting moment of reconciliation was too painful for her to watch again, the director has said. Last week Todd Fisher told the New York Daily News that a joint funeral service was “likely”, so fans may have only one occasion to say farewell to Reynolds, all smiles and pink satin top hats, and Fisher, all sardonic barbs and dress-down honesty. Billie Lourd, Fisher’s daughter by the leading Hollywood agent Bryan Lourd, once said that Reynolds was annoyed that she was never described as “Debbie Reynolds’s granddaughter” and that both women urged her to avoid an acting career. Reynolds even showed Lourd diaries from her days on set in the 1950s, including a letter to herself which read: “Dear Debbie, you’re sitting in the make-up chair, you have no eyebrows, you’re a shell of yourself, and it’s 5am. How did you get here?” “Her advice would be to keep true to yourself and don’t lose yourself. Or your eyebrows,” Lourd told Vanity Fair. Nevertheless, in a fitting finale to the film, and perhaps to two performers’ lives, the final shots are of Fisher and Reynolds consoling each other on a couch, reciting the lyrics to There’s No Business Like Show Business. Famous mothers and daughters Kate Hudson and Goldie Hawn Hudson, 37, made her name as a serious actor in Almost Famous in 2000. Her mother, 71, was the comic darling of Rowan &amp; Martin’s Laugh-In of the 1960s and graduated to romcoms and earned an Oscar nomination in 1980 for Private Benjamin. She returns to the screen in Snatched later this year. Melanie Griffith and Tippi Hedren The star of 1988’s Working Girl made ordinariness charming. In contrast her mother was Alfred Hitchcock’s ideal, remote “woman in grey” and represented highly-strung perfection in Alfred Hitchcock’s The Birds and Marnie. Jamie Lee Curtis and Janet Leigh Curtis, 58, specialised in comedy, appearing in Trading Places, A Fish Called Wanda and Freaky Friday, after starring first in the 1978 horror classic Halloween. Her glamorous mother starred in Orson Welles’s Touch of Evil, but is forever the doomed woman in the shower in Psycho. Liza Minnelli and Judy Garland Minnelli, 70, has survived a succession of health scares and remains a cult figure for her performance as Sally Bowles in Cabaret.

But as Mr Johnson prepares to watch his higher education and research bill continue its passage through the Lords, I would say this to him: either you or Mr Xi understands the true value of an independent university and, whichever one it is, he does not have a brother called Boris. Xi Xinping, naturally enough, understands the independence of universities as a threat and a growing one. Three weeks ago, he told China’s universities: “Adherence to the Party’s leadership is essential to the development of higher education.” Good luck to them in the international league tables with that weight hanging round their neck. In this country, we ought to understand the independence of universities as an integral part of a delicate system that has produced brilliant academic success and a huge British export on a shoestring budget. I am not sure that politicians, even ones as thoughtful as Mr Johnson, have grasped how essential independence is in that mix. There is an awful arrogance about Whitehall sometimes. We have, by general consent, the world’s second-best higher education system. It is far from perfect, with, for example, too little flexibility between pure academic work and technical and vocational training. Yet, given the lamentable funding record of governments of every stripe, its quality is little short of miraculous. It seems particularly ham-fisted to turn the academic world upside down when universities face so much turbulence and uncertainty after the Brexit vote and the rhetoric surrounding immigration. Moreover, to give the impression that one goal is to inject a shot of entrepreneurial vim, so that universities can replicate the energy and outlook of – who shall we say, Philip Green? – seems unlikely to convince those who work in and study at our universities that ministers understand and care much about what they are doing. This does not mean that universities should be immunised against change or competent management. Universities will change in the decades ahead. They may work in a variety of different ways with a greater spread of objectives. They should be left to explore their own mission and shape their own identity. Their integrity and autonomy should be preserved at all cost. Facing a leap in the dark, universities are told to trust ministers and civil servants to behave properly. Johnson says that he has “no intention of telling universities how to do their jobs”. But the bill that he recommends we swallow gives the secretary of state greater power than ever to direct the course of research. Ministers are required only to “have regard” for academic freedom. It will be the minister, not an academic, who makes appointments to our research councils that make vital decisions about the focus and direction of academic research. Should we take all this on trust? At the very least, the government should allow a thorough review of the bill’s effects three years or so after it is enacted, to provide an opportunity to change things that are not working. Worst of all is the power given to the Office for Students to revoke the acts of parliament or royal charters that have established our universities. How can it be right to allow institutions, some of very ancient standing, to be abolished with only weak parliamentary scrutiny? Did Thomas Cromwell write this part of the bill? There is much else that should be amended. The social sciences, for example, are absent from the list of research functions that should be supported. Finally, there is the artificial divide between research and funding, though in practice the two go hand in hand. Think of university museums, or those laboratories that provide both service and teaching facilities. The bill needs to be clearer about the organisations and programmes that straddle this divide. All this and much more will confuse and irritate our universities. If only some of the energy that has been thrown into engineering this upheaval had gone into finding solutions to the problems created by Brexit and our crazy immigration policy. Alas, we appear to be stuck with a bad bill that, perhaps, the House of Lords can marginally improve.

INSERT INTO `Articles` VALUES ('commentisfree/2017/jan/01/creative-industries-key-to-uk-economy','The sector that, more than any other, wanted a different result in the EU referendum could now be at the heart of what we might call an international rescue mission. The creative industries, for nearly a decade the fastest-growing part of the economy, are Brand Britain. They play exactly into the prime minister’s stated three priorities – a new industrial strategy, greater social cohesion, and negotiating positives from Brexit. Their response to last June’s result demonstrates their resilience and ability to deal with everything thrown in their way. In the early summer they were clear about the country’s future. Indeed, so much so that, when the final figures for the Creative Industries Federation’s members survey came in, I feared it looked a bit North Korean. The UK’s TV and film companies, video games, digital creative, designers, fashion, publishers, great museums and galleries, architects, advertisers and universities had voted 96% to “remain”. When the deed was done, the sector could have indulged in a lament. Instead it began the slog towards identifying opportunities from the great European reverse. At first glance this might have seemed a forlorn task. In Theresa May and Philip Hammond the government was in the hands of two figures with little track record of interest in the sector. Yet what if this interpretation is wrong? This is not a plea to an imperious government to do more for the arts; it is more a pointer to a government eager for “wins” about what the arts can do for it. First the stats: the UK’s creative industries contribute almost £90bn net to GDP; it accounts for one in 11 jobs, a rate rising more quickly than all other parts of the economy. These jobs are also among the least likely to be lost to automation. Many of our commercial companies are shining examples of ingenuity and entrepreneurship. The link between culture and tech and science is strong and growing. Our publicly supported arts are largely very well run, deploying scant resources with great skill. Across Britain, from Margate to Manchester, from Bristol to Nottingham, many arts organisations play a pivotal role in civic life. The more far-sighted local authorities (and there are many) have for two decades seen a stunning return on their investment, in terms of education, public health, tourism, jobs – and, most of all, pride. There is every prospect that Hull’s city of culture, which launches on 1 January, will be a resounding success. It has already attracted significant plaudits and investment. The Great Exhibition of the North in Gateshead and Newcastle follows in 2018. For sure, some arts organisations continue to act as self-affirming liberal bubbles, allowing their detractors to denounce them as part of an “elite”. Mostly this is a lazy misperception. Many organisations are deeply ingrained in communities. Look at the English National Ballet’s current work with people suffering from dementia. What other form of activity has regularly delivered so much on so little? What other form of activity also defines the UK so clearly? In China, in late 2013, David Cameron was intrigued when asked in a social media chat why he couldn’t get the makers of Sherlock to hurry up with more episodes. Around the world, our fashion and design, our video games and theatre, are our calling cards. During the coalition government, the then business secretary, Vince Cable, didn’t even recognise the creative industries as an industry, an omission that made no economic sense at the time or since. In the course of this month, Greg Clark will have the opportunity to rectify that and formally to place the sector where it belongs – at the centre of British economics and politics. In her forthcoming major speech on life after the EU, May has the opportunity to reinforce that message. Will they? Ministers are at least listening and engaging. But old thinking is not hard to find. A month ago I was part of a UK delegation to Shanghai working on collaborations from virtual reality to Shakespeare. Culture was combining with education, tech, science and health. Then, in front of his Chinese audience, Jeremy Hunt gave a keynote speech on behalf of the UK government in which he described culture secretary Karen Bradley as running the “ministry of fun”. Bradley was less than thrilled at the depiction. Of all people, didn’t Hunt, a former secretary of state for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, know that there is nothing soft about the creative sector? There is a gaping hole in the government’s strategic approach – its consistent refusal to understand the link between arts education and economic success. If the prime minister wishes to limit the number of EU nationals working in the UK, she will need to make sure there are enough Brits to take their place. In this sector alone, there are 17 defined skills shortages in areas such as animation and visual effects. Meanwhile, head teachers are being discouraged from investing in design and technology, arts, music and drama. Not only has this policy deprived children (particularly from disadvantaged backgrounds) from enjoying a rounded education, the economic consequences are already playing themselves out. Creative learning is not just a route into the arts, it is also essential across the economy. Ask app inventors or car designers. Oddly, Brexit might be the spur to sort this. If we don’t have ready access to the talent that filled our skills gaps for years, we have to find our own. The cause for my tentative optimism lies in political self-interest. Which other sector can do all of the following – help improve social mobility, help repair societal rifts, drive exports, grow the economy and define the UK internationally?

This is the year of a nail-biting election in France, and Angela Merkel’s sternest test yet in Germany after the migration crisis and terror attack in Berlin. But the country whose fortunes will play a major role in determining how far the European Union, for all its frictions and shortcomings, remains a credible community of values, is Poland. There Jarosław Kaczyński, head of the Law and Justice party and de facto ruler, has spent 2016 eroding constitutional checks and balances on the judiciary, public appointments, army, press and broadcasting in a purge of liberals and the post-communist left. A chaotic session of parliament before Christmas saw the annual budget voted through outside the main chamber without opposition support, while the outgoing president of Poland’s highest constitutional court accused Law and Justice of setting the country “on the road to autocracy”. Kaczyński is betting that an EU preoccupied by unresolved economic woes in southern Europe and the backwash of Brexit will do little more than sabre-rattle, as the largest of the states that acceded to the union in 2004 follows Viktor Orbán’s Hungary into grumpy isolation; a 21st-century form of nationalist fervour and a two-fingered salute to the EU. Call it the Polish problem – its implications ripple far beyond Warsaw or Budapest. The EU prides itself on being a grouping of states in which democratic norms underwritten by law were the criteria for accession in the early 2000s. But once membership is granted, the clunky EU machinery makes it hard to take action against a country that embraces autocracy. Law and Justice rode to power on the back of frustration that the post-1989 settlement failed to spread wealth more equally and frustration with endemic corruption. Kaczyński promises budget deficit-inducing spending programmes aimed at low earners. He cites Polish “ordinary working people” as dupes of an out-of-touch liberal elite or self-serving technocrats – both of which accusations contain an inconvenient grain of truth. But the clampdowns of 2016 have far exceeded any defensible attempt at rebalancing political interests. The EU, for so long a destination of choice for progressives in central Europe, must then decide this year whether it is content to remain inactive when basic freedoms are gobbled up in the state that represents its sixth biggest economy. Or whether it should take the fight to Warsaw on the grounds that a supine EU has become a hollow shell, haemorrhaging credibility. In a year when we will need to become more fluent in EU article-speak, article 7 – the EU’s as yet untested vehicle for imposing sanctions – will be in the spotlight. There is, however, a catch: it can be invoked only by means of a unanimous vote which would enable Hungary, under the autocratic Orbán, to oppose it. (Fellow autarchs tend to stick together when confronted). So far, Kaczyński has concluded he can ignore imprecations from Brussels or half-hearted protests from members with their minds on other matters. His officials have taken to spouting lines reminiscent of the cold war in defence of purges of liberal incumbents, citing the “no interference in internal affairs” doctrine favoured by leaders under fire for bad behaviour at home. What might change matters? There is one bold route around the problem, namely to persuade member states to trigger article 7.1 – which would allow sanctions to be deployed against both Poland and Hungary if they continue to disregard basic rights. That would neatly end the “fellow traveller” veto, by putting both of the EU’s rogue states in special measures. Failing to observe that warning could lead to the suspension of voting rights. The threat carries some hefty risks. It plays to the view propagated by Law and Justice that the EU is meddling – and the experience of testing popular opinion against Eurocrats has not had a happy 2016. In addition, Germany, which would need to support a stronger line, will not be keen in election year to pick a fight with a querulous neighbour. But Warsaw’s position is more fragile than its rhetoric. It remains exposed to the whims of the even more vigorous autocracy to its east, Vladimir Putin’s Russia. Too great a tilt to stroppy isolationism, at a point when Washington’s policies towards Moscow are opaque and unreliable, and Poland risks becoming the friendless giant of eastern central Europe. That is not enviable positioning when the region’s delicate security compact look less solid than at any time since before 1989. Moscow recently stirred uneasy ghosts by moving nuclear-capable missiles into the Kaliningrad enclave between Poland and Lithuania. A Poland flirting with self-imposed isolationism may find that the geo-political rapids of 2017 leave it looking for sound allies in edgy times, rather than more European noses to put out of joint.

In 2017 the right to have the kind of sex we want is still under threat. Once again gay people, single women, the non-monogamous, the kinky, and many other people whose sexuality does not conform to the heterosexual, child-producing marital bedroom, will be forced to articulate their right to sexual freedom. For many adults, merely having sex, and being sexual, will become a political act. Welcome to the year of assertive sexuality. In the 21st century the state wields control over sexuality through access to healthcare. In the United States, Donald Trump has appointed an orthopaedic surgeon, Tom Price, as his secretary of health and human services. Price has a record of opposition to LGBTQ and abortion rights and has voted in the past to deprive non-profit organisation Planned Parenthood of taxpayer support. Even if Trump chooses not to revoke the Affordable Care Act, it’s likely the mandate that covers contraception will be repealed. A woman’s sexual freedom depends on her ability to access affordable contraception, treatment for infections and abortion services. Trump, who has a lifetime of boasting about his sexual promiscuity (both consensual and not), wants to impose a paradigm of risk on women, who will lose autonomy and safety and will face unnecessary and prohibitive expense and inconvenience in their pursuit of sexual happiness. The United Kingdom also saw an attempt to thwart sexual freedom by denying access to healthcare in 2016. It was only after a successful lawsuit filed by the National Aids Trust and persistent lobbying by activists that the NHS announced in December that it would fund a three-year clinical trial that will make pre-exposure prophylaxis available through the NHS to 10,000 people at risk of contracting HIV. This was a shift from earlier in the year, when the NHS had made it clear that it would limit availability of PrEP to 500 men “most at high risk”. Denying healthcare to certain populations in a misguided attempt to influence their sexual behaviour is a form of social control and exclusion that arbitrarily codes certain sexual acts as good or bad and certain lives as more dispensable than others. The point of such efforts – and other forms of sexual censorship, like the attempts of the Conservative government to block pornographic websites that show female ejaculation or that break the “four finger rule” – is to assert a hierarchy of sexual cultures in which heteronormativity occupies a place at the top and alternative sexual preferences are maligned as risky or obscene. Attempts to re-establish a notion of “normal”, “conventional” and “responsible” sexuality come at a time in which consensus about what an adult life should look like is rapidly dissolving. In the United States and the United Kingdom, adults are getting married later or not at all. In the years of their lives in which they are dating and having shorter-term sexual relationships, technology has offered new ways of meeting people, of fantasising and of finding sexual community. A shift in cultural morals has opened space for the articulation of a broad spectrum of sexual identities, orientations and gender identifications. If the first decade of the new century was about broadening access to institutions such as marriage, the second might be about taking pride in sex as an end in itself. The culture finds itself at a crossroads: either attempt to restore a false consensus about what constitutes a legitimate sexuality, an ideal of monogamous fidelity that always contained hypocrisy, that not even the president-elect of the United States can claim to have upheld; or embrace a more honest view of the contemporary way some people relate to each other. For the growing population of adults who have failed in one way or another to live up to an ideal of what a “good heterosexual” looks like, either because they have never married, or have divorced, or because they are not heterosexual at all, attempts by politicians to marginalise their sex lives would be comical if they didn’t come at such a high cost. The only response that feels right, at this juncture in history, is to dispense with euphemism. Don’t call contraception “family planning”. Don’t limit the idea of sexual freedom to the right to marry (although even that right remains threatened.) Don’t let the enjoyment of pornography be pathologised. Don’t meekly try to make your sexuality palatable to the people who are determined to deny its legitimacy. In 2016 cautious appeals for responsibility lost out to ostentation and lies; 2017 is not a time to be demure.

Best perhaps to abandon the task of objective prediction in favour of the search for hope. Is there any chance that those who accept complexity rather than demand false certainty, that those who search for solutions not for blame, could get their act together? Could 2017 be the year of the moderate insurgency? Such an insurgency needs help from its enemies. Expect “betrayal” to be on many lips as the year unfolds. As the complexity and cost of Brexit becomes clearer, and with the rest of Europe demanding a high price for access to the single market, many who voted out with high hopes will be dismayed. On the Leave side, an acrimonious split will grow between realists willing to negotiate the terms of a qualified departure, and fundamentalists who see a complete rupture from the European mainstream as the path to national resurgence. In the US, Donald Trump’s more radical supporters are already protesting against the abandonment of some of his more wacky campaign promises. Trump’s presidency will vividly demonstrate the gap between populism’s strengths as a campaigning tool and its inadequacies as a method of democratic governance. As the new president’s erratic behaviour, incoherent policy programme and tendency to fall out with anyone who stands up to him moves from being a novelty to a national liability, the Republicans will be deeply split over how to respond to Democratic resurgence ahead of the 2018 midterms. America’s travails will provide strategic opportunities for Russia and China, but while internal dissent in both countries will continue to be suppressed, Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping may see an opportunity to take on the mantle of global leadership in areas ranging from confronting terrorism to climate change. In France, Marine Le Pen will fight a determined and opportunistic campaign, but her defeat, combined with victory for Angela Merkel, could highlight the limits of populism’s appeal and provide the momentum for continental leaders at last to address the deeper faultlines of the European project. The moderate insurgency could have many fronts. Back home, Theresa May’s government – its right wing distracted by Brexit – will continue slowly to develop an account of one-nation Conservatism including a critique of business practice in areas such as executive pay and poor working conditions (on which subject I am leading a review for the prime minister), and a commitment to a regionally focused industrial strategy. Austerity will be seen as a burden to be lessened, not a virtue to be extolled. Historians may come to see 2017 as the beginning of the end for the long, intellectually barren era of neoliberalism. There could even be signs of life in the Labour party. A surprise victory in April for Gerard Coyne’s members-first campaign to lead the trade union Unite could have a powerful impact. It will be moderate insurgency in action, showing pragmatism can be a successful electoral strategy. In Len McCluskey, it will remove Jeremy Corbyn’s most powerful supporter, and it could contribute to the emergence of new models of trade unionism relevant to modern forms of employment and pursuing partnership rather than confrontation in the workplace. Another disappointing round of local elections in May (the success of mayoral candidates such as Andy Burnham in Manchester in spite of, not because of, Labour in Westminster) will be the final straw for Labour MPs, and with his own activist base now hopelessly divided, Corbyn may not even put up a fight. The victory of emerging frontrunner Keir Starmer in the subsequent contest could provide Labour with credible leadership. An insurgency needs a programme, so just as important as the top job would be the stirrings of intellectual renewal as the party explores radical policy ideas such as universal basic income and the major reform of our creaking tax system. Labour’s debate would hint at a deeper shift in the public mood. People will remember that, as well as political extremism, war, terror and a remarkable celebrity death toll, 2016 was a year in which absolute poverty levels continued to decline, and deaths from malaria halved; a year when international communities of city leaders, climate change activists and medical scientists focused not just on today’s challenges but tomorrow’s opportunities. As we become aware of the scope for technology to transform our lives, there will be a determination to create a world where science and innovation benefits us all, not just the billionaires of Silicon Valley. Defying expectations, will 2017 be the year optimism comes back into fashion? Sick of complaining, resigned to the failures of their parents’ generation, young people will be inspired by the simple question “Why not?” Just like the shift in America from the&nbsp;gilded age of division and excess in the late 19th century to the progressive era of the early 20th century, there will be an explosion of social innovation. Across the globe we will see new social movements focused less on protest and more on solutions, the growth of alternative business models, ambitious ideas to renew the public realm, growing confidence and bold experimentation among city leaders. Taking the energy of populism but combining it with optimism, the sapping narrative of the elite versus the masses will be replaced by a patient determination to make politics the engine of social engagement and progress. The moderate insurgency will smash apart the assumption that you have to be enraged and extreme to be determined and active. By now you may be wondering whether I wrote this piece having started my new year celebrations early. I’m not putting money on any of the above. But if, after the many defeats and divisions of 2016, optimism appeals, remember a simple truth: when it comes to human progress it is not hope that leads to action but action that leads to hope.

In the 12 months to June 2016, the number of deaths jumped by the biggest absolute and relative amount since 1940 – a rise of 52,400. And this appears not solely to be an effect of a growing and ageing population, since the increase is spread across age groups. (Deaths rose by 12% among those aged 90 and over; 10% for 85-89; 7% for 80-84; 5% for 75-70; and 3% for those aged 55-74.) This is unprecedented in peacetime . The jump, unreported in national media, is not entirely a surprise. Death rates have been rising slightly since 2010, reversing what was a steady fall since the 1970s. This is part of a general decline in health and wellbeing over the same period. The Office for National Statistics’ survey of wellbeing reports that the numbers who are self-reporting satisfaction with their health has consistently declined since 2010. The “happiness index” recorded its lowest ever level in March 2016. It was the over-65s whose votes are taking Britain out of the EU: the working population between 18 and 64 voted Remain by a narrow margin, with the majorities increasing among successively younger voters. The common explanation is that the elderly, pampered by their pensions rising in real terms, could indulge a misty-eyed vision of a 1950s-style sovereign Britain and voted for an irrecoverable imperial past rather than a European future. But these figures offer a darker explanation. The elderly knew the current order was so dysfunctional it was not only making them ill, it was making an increasing number of their friends die earlier than anyone had expected. There is affirmation from the US. It was the old and ill who gave Donald Trump his victory. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, the Economist reports, has compiled county-level data across the US on life expectancy and the prevalence of obesity, diabetes, heavy drinking and lack of regular physical exercise. Mr Trump beat Mitt Romney’s base of support in 2012 by a stunning margin, but the analysts think that these indicators of ill-health explain 43% of those gains – an even greater indicator, then, than being college or non-college educated. As the Economist wryly remarks, if diabetes had been 7% lower in Michigan, heavy drinking 5% lower in Wisconsin or 8% more Pennsylvanians had taken regular exercise, then Hillary Clinton would now be heading for the White House. White working-class America has been enveloped in a gathering public health crisis for decades. As life expectancy for Hispanics and African Americans has risen, so it has fallen for poor whites, with alcoholism, suicide and drug abuse rising strongly. Deindustrisalisation and the collapse of blue-collar employment not only mean lost jobs and declining real wages, they create futility and purposelessness that can lead to self-harm and early death, especially if the wider structures that offer health and social care are weakening. In Britain, Oxford University’s Professor Danny Dorling thinks part of the reason for the jump in British death rates is the roll-back of social and health provision. Losses in adult homecare visits, meals on wheels, bus services and the general squeeze on health spending have been felt most acutely among the late middle aged and elderly. Former chancellor George Osborne’s insistence that the entire deficit reduction programme be shouldered by spending cuts, rather than in balance with tax rises, was not only bad economics, it has been ruinous for health and wellbeing. All this is overlaid on a country where the inequalities have been growing faster and to higher absolute levels than anywhere in the industrialised world. In large parts of the country there is no more than a “foundation economy” providing subsistence – supermarkets, petrol stations, schools, hospitals and local administration – with virtually no economic activity adding value. Productivity runs at a fraction of the levels of London and the south-east. Local authorities presiding over all this have suffered incredible cuts and have less power to compensate by raising money locally than in any other western country, another bitter first in a catalogue of baleful league tables. Older voters living in these areas – the rise in death rates in the north-east, for example, was the highest in the UK – can be forgiven for thinking that anything would be better than the status quo, even a change as self-destructive as Brexit. Theresa May’s government, and business secretary, Greg Clark, in particular, are at least beginning to understand the spatial inequality problem and the redirection of policy needed to address it. The autumn statement promised a quintupling, to more than £2bn over the next five years, of the resources that Innovate UK will have to stimulate fast-growing firms, especially in the “left-behind” parts of Britain – a 360-degree reversal of their predecessors’ policy, which was a running down of the entire apparatus. But while this is a good starting point, there is as yet no sense of urgency or creation of a national purpose within which an imaginative and convincing response might be cast. Too much energy is spent keeping the fissiparous Tory party together rather than governing for the country. Hard Brexit, with a bill running into many wasted billions, is a destructive distraction. Meanwhile, the squeeze on health and social care continues. There is no willingness to relegitimise taxation as the means to create public good. The debate about immigration is wildly disproportionate to its importance in the revitalisation of British life: after all, fewer than 80,000 non-UK citizens took full-time residence in the UK last year. Dispelling the widespread sense of futility, ill health and unhappiness that besets so many lives is going to require more than controlling immigration. The Labour leadership offers little or nothing; it is intellectually bereft and politically marginalised. Of course, the Lib Dems are right to insist we must stay as close to the EU as possible, but that alone will not address the depth of the inequalities and lack of hope at the root of declining life expectancy and the collapse in wellbeing. Yes, the madness of hard Brexit should be stopped, but that can only be done by offering hope and resources to the millions who have been denied both for too long. So, 2017 needs to be the year when our national debate gets real. A death epidemic is a grim reminder of how high the stakes have risen.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/01/good-health-good-society-we-are-suffering','Good health is born of a good society.

Birth Choice reveals that pregnant women in London are more likely to request pain relief before going into labour than in other areas of Britain. The study of 48,000 prospective parents found that age and location could influence preferences in other ways – two-thirds of Scottish women were interested in birthing pools, while women over 40 were more likely to want medical intervention (foetal monitoring, episiotomies) than young women. Reading all this was interesting. But at the same time, I thought that while choice is all-important, let’s not fall into the trap of turning options for pain relief – or, rather, turning it down – into a gigantic, virtue-signalling competition. In my experience, giving birth is a lot of things, but it’s also painful. I had an unplanned, “natural”, drug-free labour with my first child – she was too tiny and quick for anything else, practically greeting the world in the back of a minicab. Then an emergency caesarean section for my second girl, who was premature and in real trouble. The first time, the pain was brief but shocking. “That smarts!” doesn’t begin to cover it – it felt like I was birthing a lit catherine wheel. But the epidural delivery was worse – the numbing, the operation, the scar, the shock, the weakness, the blur. I don’t wish to scare prospective mums – my complications need to be factored in – but it was tough, leading to my ongoing frustration that the epidural delivery is routinely dismissed as the “easy” option for mums “too posh to push”. This is what niggles here – not the study itself, which, after all, just presented viewpoints, but, rather, the wider culture of debating the general rights and wrongs of pain relief in labour, as if it were anyone’s business other than the particular woman during the particular birth. Add to this the bizarre background hum of machismo in some quarters – this notion that, ideally, women should be waving away “interference”, cracking their knuckles in the delivery suite, intoning on some gestational tape loop: “It’s the most natural thing in the world.” That, say, Londoners planning pain relief, older mums contemplating some intervention or Scottish women wanting birthing pools, are somehow lesser. (More neurotic? Wussy?). Isn’t this what happens time and again – ordinary women criticised and lampooned (sometimes by other women) for… well, what exactly? Trying to plot a way through, avoid pain and stress, keep themselves and their babies safe, while doing this immense, perilous thing, giving birth, which used to routinely kill so many women in previous eras and in some parts of&nbsp;the world still does? All this censure and ridicule for women giving birth, from the same society that calls sportsmen “courageous” if they carry on playing a game of football after they’ve stubbed their big toe. Certainly, it seems ironic to the point of farcical that something as definitively female as the act of giving birth could ever be imbued with a phoney aura of machismo. The ongoing fallacy that some women are “braver”/“better”, because they don’t ask for as much help. Well, take it from me, there’s often no planning in how a birth is going to go. Some women give birth exactly how they want; others end up having to improvise in the great game of delivery roulette. However, if at any point you see a way through that will keep you and your baby calm and safe, then take it and own it. Believe me, I’ve been there and sometimes a “wuss” needs all the help she can get. Gunning for the urban fox is no way to start a new year A petition organised by Labour party animal rights activists is asking London mayor, Sadiq Khan, to stop widespread fox-culling in the capital after the festive season. Foxes are more active around this time because of the extra food to be found in our rubbish and litter. So the plan is for pest controllers to shoot them. Happy new year! First, surplus litter is something that councils should address and in more humane ways than simply shooting animals. Hmm, this is difficult, let me think – how about organising bin collections? As has been pointed out, the cull would have no long-term effect on fox numbers and it is nonsensical to classify foxes as vermin because, if anything, they help control pests. Also, while Londoners are only too aware that foxes rip rubbish bags if they’re left out overnight, that’s about it. While there are probably some instances of dangerous or antisocial fox behaviour, I’d wager most Londoners have seen plenty of foxes (I once saw an enormous one lying, like a lion, on my shed roof), but have never seen them come anywhere near people. And I’ve never heard of a pet being harmed. So, why shoot London’s foxes, which exist, reportedly, in their thousands? This is not about being “soppy” over foxes. It is about looking at alternative approaches, such as more efficient waste collection in busy periods as well as other, proved fox deterrents, for example, lockable bins, prickly fencing and animal repellent, especially if the alternative is to have people with guns wandering around residential areas shooting animals for trying to forage a bit of old turkey from our bins. If such a scenario were suggested for a video game it would be denounced as just too pathetic and depressing, so why should Londoners have to suffer the reality? Yes, breaking up is hard to do, but easier with money, Gwyneth Gwyneth Paltrow says that even though she and Chris Martin aren’t a couple anymore, they’re still a “family”, and he’d take a bullet for her, and … yak, yak, preachy, self-satisfied yak. Actually, Paltrow and Martin are to be applauded. Their “conscious uncoupling” has been a resounding success and they didn’t end up clawing each other’s eyes out in the Hamptons, however much some people hoped for this outcome. It’s all good and their children can only benefit from such an evolved approach. So why do I feel an almost irresistible impulse to yell at Paltrow to “smug off!”? And suggest that she might care to locate a smidgen of self-awareness, not least to acknowledge that maybe (just maybe) the fact they are filthy rich and privileged (with no money or property issues) may just have boosted their chances of a serene postmarital result and that less blessed people may be dealing with more pressures. Again, all credit to them for the conscious uncoupling thing (not all wealthy couples split with such grace), but perhaps Paltrow could try the conscious, mindful thing and avoid bragging about it. • Comments will be opened later','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/01/having-a-baby-dont-be-brave-take-drugs-foxes-gwyneth-paltrow','Having a baby?

But in late April 2016, as the throng of refugees jostled on to the waiting boat, 13-year-old Dawit somehow went ahead and was separated from his mother and brother. Panicking, he attempted to leap overboard as the vessel pulled away from the Egyptian coast. Witnesses described the young Eritrean as “petrified” and sobbing as he watched his mother and younger brother, who were still on the shore. Dawit survived the crossing – unlike more than 5,000 refugees who drowned while making it in 2016 – arriving in Sicily before being taken to a reception centre in Rome. From there, he called his mother twice a day. The two were close, a bond amplified following his father’s disappearance shortly after joining the Eritrean military. But Dawit’s mother and brother never turned up. Their boat belatedly left north Africa on 3 June 2016. Chronically overcrowded, it was rocking alarmingly as it headed for Italy. Eventually it broke apart and sank. Both drowned. Even by the standards of the multiple tragic narratives of the refugee crisis, Dawit’s ordeal is shocking. But the orphan’s personal anguish is also about to affect the destiny of potentially thousands of child refugees. On 19 December, in a so-far undisclosed but groundbreaking judgment, the high court in Britain ordered that Dawit be brought to the UK immediately and reunited with his aunt in north London. Delivering another legal defeat for the Home Office over its approach to the refugee crisis, the judgment carries profound implications for thousands of unaccompanied minors in Italy and throughout Europe. It allows the court to intervene when the Dublin regulation, designed to reunite unaccompanied refugee children with their families, is failing to protect the “best interests” of vulnerable minors. Although attention has been focused on France and the aftermath of the Calais camp being dismantled, huge numbers of unaccompanied child refugees have gathered in Italy. UN figures reveal 19,000 minors arrived there between January and October 2016, an 88% rise on the same period in 2015. A sizeable number are believed to have legal rights to family reunification in the UK, but campaigners say the system is broken. None were transferred from Italy in 2014 and 2015, and only three in 2016. It is almost certain that Dawit, who turned 14 last month, would have remained alone and traumatised in Rome had he not been identified by volunteers working for Safe Passage, a programme of Citizens UK, the social action charity chiefly responsible for the successful transfer of children from Calais to Britain and whose court triumph last January kickstarted the resettlement of minors in northern France to the UK. The belief is that Dawit’s case will act as a similar catalyst for children in Italy and Europe. “The courts have given the government legal, but also moral direction in how they should approach this serious and desperate issue,” said Rabbi Janet Darley of Citizens UK, which last year founded Safe Passage. Darley said the Home Office’s attempt to block Dawit’s case was illustrative. “You do not leave a sick and bereaved child in the road to deter others from trying to cross. Particularly when it is our own government’s failure to make the Dublin regulations work that has blocked the pavements.” Dawit, whose identity cannot be revealed for legal reasons, is expected to arrive in London imminently, where he will stay with his British aunt, Sesuna. For her, it is the first positive development since travelling to Rome on 7 June and telling Dawit that his mother and brother were dead. Six months on, the teenager is unable to rationalise his loss. “He has found it extremely difficult to process this news and has appeared dazed and in disbelief,” say court documents chronicling his grief. Psychological assessments confirm Dawit is suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, a condition that deteriorates each day he is kept apart from his aunt. “The ongoing separation from his family is causing this vulnerable child harm and deep suffering. He is frightened and highly distressed,” say the legal documents. Dawit’s plight has also highlighted the attitude of the Home Office to unaccompanied minors. The Dublin regulations were designed to protect the “best interests of the child”, but the court documents suggest a profoundly different approach. On 26 September, Dawit’s lawyers wrote to the Home Office outlining details of his “compelling case”, along with references to his declining mental state, suggesting the child be brought to London by 18 October. The Home Office did not respond. On 10 October his lawyers’s wrote again, this time requesting a transfer by 31 October. Again there was no reply. Critics say it is no surprise that the court judgment found the Home Office “acted unlawfully” in light of its obligations to the young Eritrean. So far, through the tenacious championing of Safe Passage, 220 children have been given refuge in the UK using the Dublin agreement. Dawit’s lawyer, Mark Scott of Bhatt Murphy, hopes the court triumph will transform the dynamic with thousands of minors benefiting. “This case sends a very clear message to European governments and the European commission: effective systems must be established so that the rights to family reunification in the European regulations and directives are accessible for children.” For Dawit, broken by trauma and bewildered by the reluctance of adults to reunite him with the remaining members of his family, the legal victory offers the chance of a new life and an opportunity to heal.','https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/01/eritrean-refugee-tragedy-guardian-observer-appeal-safe-passage-charity','Dawit’s story: how one young refugee’s tragedy could spell hope for thousands',198,'society'),('commentisfree/2017/jan/01/the-readers-editor-google-advertising','Google has come under fire in the Observer recently in a series of investigations that revealed how rightwingers had manipulated the search engine’s algorithms to create a sinister new reality, particularly around Holocaust denial, Muslims and women, with hate sites such as Stormfront finding their way to the top of search rankings. After nearly a month of pressure, Google, which initially resisted making any changes, eventually bumped the white supremacists out of the way – on some searches, at least. Google’s late move came after the Observer had found a way to push the neo-Nazis down the rankings: for £289, the paper placed an advertisement at the top of search results about the Holocaust. “The Holocaust really happened,” said the advert. “Six million Jews really did die. These search results are propagating lies. Please take action.” Carole Cadwalladr, the Observer journalist who broke the story, wrote that the company had shown that it would not respond to outrage or public sentiment “but it was prepared to take my cold, hard cash… I did it with the only language that Google understands: money”. Her latest piece in the series filled page 3 on 18 December, our last issue before Christmas. And yet that same issue appeared, not with a traditional front page but with a four-page “wraparound” advertisement for Google’s new Pixel phone. Readers were understandably bemused. “There was a delicious irony in the lambasting of Google for responding to ‘the only language it understands: money’ when the Observer allowed an advertisement for Google’s Pixel phone to hijack its front, back and inside covers. Money does indeed talk,” was a typical response. “I am writing to say how disappointed I was to see a wraparound advert for Google rather than your normal front page,” another reader wrote. “After last week’s articles regarding Google’s algorithms, with even more reports in this edition [18 December], it seems that you are supporting Google in what it does. “I know that advertising money is required by newspapers but by selling such a large advert, your reports appear to be undermined and your readers are getting mixed messages as to what the Observer stands for.” Another wrote of his “considerable dismay” on seeing the advert. “I was struck by the irony, given the previous edition contained an excellent article by Carole Cadwalladr (“Google, democracy and the truth about internet search”). “Indeed, the Observer has not been afraid to criticise Google for failing to pay what is deemed to be its fair share of taxation in this country. So, perhaps you can imagine my surprise to see the Observer implicitly endorsing Google (specifically, its Pixel phone); more importantly, I wonder if you are able to provide an explanation? Otherwise the Observer leaves itself open to criticisms of hypocrisy.” This is perhaps a textbook example of the strict separation that exists between a newspaper’s advertising and editorial departments. Of course, advertising helps pay for the journalism that you read here every week, but the revenue it brings in should never sway the independence of the editorial team and its output. And it is important to remember that the appearance of an advertisement is not an indication that the paper endorses the advertised product. Google’s Pixel phone campaign has run in every national newspaper for some weeks, so it was not exceptional for the Observer to take it; indeed, advertisements for the phone had already appeared in the paper before 18 December and we can expect to see more in 2017, both in print and online. The editor knew in advance that the four-page wraparound was booked but saw no need to change editorial plans. “Google obviously knew we had been running these pieces about them but they were not deterred from advertising and, in turn, we were not deterred from placing a story critical of them in a prominent position in the same issue,” he said. There are, however, wider questions about the disruptive nature of today’s advertising. As newspaper revenues shrink, advertisers are becoming bolder in their demands. The editor believes cover wraps of any nature disturb the balance and flow of a newspaper and kill the impact of its front page; they should be accepted only rarely, despite the commercial pressures faced by the industry. And yet despite all this, advertising revenues continue to shrink. In 2014-15, global newspaper circulation revenues overtook advertising revenues for the first time, with the 2016 World Press Trends report showing that $90bn (53% of revenue) came from print and digital circulation, compared with $78bn from advertising. And while readers point to the paradox of a newspaper taking advertising from a company that it also attacks within its own pages, there is a further irony: newspaper websites are seeing a slowing in advertising growth because revenue is going not to the news producers that bear the cost of coverage, but to the platforms that pick it up: chiefly Facebook – and Google. observer.readers@observer.co.uk','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/01/the-readers-editor-google-advertising','The readers’ editor on Google and editorial independence | the readers’ editor',199,'commentisfree'),('commentisfree/2017/jan/01/all-little-girls-out-there-2017-better-year','‘To all the little girls watching,” Hillary Clinton said in her November concession speech, and tweeted the phrase for emphasis, “never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world.” Perhaps the line was something recycled from the victory speech she’d hoped to make. Since, although no doubt inspirational – and duly liked over a million times – it was a fairly odd thing to say. The little girls, after all, had just seen an experienced and competent woman candidate defeated, incredibly, by a boastful thug with a proud history of sexual molestation, or, to use the president-elect’s phrase, pussy-grabbing. His rival, Mrs Clinton, had been redefined as a witch, bitch, ancient crone and “nasty woman”. Indeed, if these same little girls had never particularly doubted their power and value before the US election, Trump’s victory was just the thing to show them that, like so many of the social and political advances that came under threat in 2016, progress towards sex equality can be reversed overnight. To paraphrase some of our leading UK rhetoricians: you lost, little girls, get over it. Moreover, the little girls might reflect, after the election, that they cannot depend on other little girls to share their and Hillary Clinton’s ideas about value and dignity. Of course, British girls knew this already, thanks to contributions from women such as Andrea Leadsom, former Tory leadership candidate, who turned out to have so much more in common with Turkey’s President Erdoğan than roughly a fifth of her own sex. “Genuinely,” she told an interviewer, believing it would promote her chances, “I feel that being a mum means you have a real stake in the future of our country, a tangible stake.” Looking at the timing, it’s not impossible Leadsom was inspired by Erdoğan’s comment, one presumably also taken to heart by Theresa May and Angela Merkel. “A woman who rejects motherhood,” he said in June, “who refrains from being around the house, however successful her working life is, is deficient, is incomplete.” Not, to be fair to Leadsom, that the May administration has done much that is visible, to date, to model female solidarity to little girls. “Don’t bring that woman to Downing Street again,” May’s senior adviser, Fiona Hill, texted a male minister about Nicky Morgan, the mutinous Remainer. “That woman”? Add “bloody difficult” and you could be listening to Ken Clarke. One of the more plausible explanations advanced for the extent of Trump’s female support is the internalising, then actual expression, by women seeking its protection, acceptance or promotion, of the culture of an overwhelmingly male establishment. Maybe there’s not so much to separate a female Trump supporter from our local Erdoğan sympathisers – or a Woman’s Hour judge who thinks that the comic creation Bridget Jones is one of the most influential women of the last 70 years. Unless that exemplified a contributory reason for Hillary’s Clinton’s defeat: the delusion that, for feminism, voluntary redundancy is long overdue. Whatever the causes, this colossal act of female self-harm should surely be lodged in the minds of all watching little girls as one of the events that established 2016 as one of worst, most retrograde, in women’s liberation history. That special place in hell that Madeleine Albright likes to talk about for women who don’t help each other? After 2016, they’re going to need an extension. Space will have to be found for the Leadsom-minded, for benevolent defenders of burqas and sharia in the UK, for Amnesty’s allies of sex traffickers, for women who fat-shame others for a Daily Mail stipend, for all the US voters who surrendered hard-fought progress in female self-determination for leadership by two apprentice patriarchs, the pussy-grabber and Mike Pence. Already in sight, if Roe v Wade is overturned, is the restriction of abortion, a method of controlling women that even the current pope chose to review. While Francis proposed forgiveness, Trump was tweeting that women – about one in three – who have abortions should be subject to “some form of punishment”. In a large section of the UK, of course, this is the law. Last year, a Northern Ireland woman received a suspended sentence for taking abortion drugs. While the victories in nearby territories, of the premiers May and Sturgeon, no doubt reassure watching little British girls about their own value, opportunities etc, these were accompanied by any number of deterrents, large and small. From Muirfield’s golfers, to employers demanding that women staff wear high heels, to discrimination in universities, to near invisibility in the Brexit debate, to the police officer whose allusions to “ugly munter” women applicants did not lose him his job, to the 19th-century-style expectations, regarding women’s sexual restraint, which were allowed to feature in the retrial of Ched Evans, girls should certainly have learned, from 2016, to take nothing for granted. Most striking, perhaps, where their instruction is concerned, was evidence of what to expect, should little girls, deliberately or not, ultimately find themselves conspicuous. As with Hillary’s tormenters, so, in this country, with Laura Kuenssberg and Charlotte Proudman, Jess Phillips, Gina Miller and Angela Eagle (who also got a brick through a window): prominent and disputatious women were punished with onslaughts of sexist abuse on social media. Thus targeted, in fact, was a woman who advised Nottinghamshire police to make the harassment of women a hate crime. It reached the point, for 45 female Labour MPs, that they wrote to an – as it turned out – unresponsive Jeremy Corbyn, criticising his failure to curb the unceasing “intolerance and misogyny” emitted by his supporters. Galloping valiantly to their rescue, however, came a new hammer of misogyny. Owen Smith was an obscure Corbyn challenger who discovered feminism immediately after elbowing out the infinitely more impressive Angela Eagle. Trust Owen, he said, his success in “pulling” his wife, Liz, to the envy of other lads, proved he was a winner, capable of, in party jargon, “smashing” Theresa May “back on her heels”. In comparison, some men thought, a briefly emotional Eagle had shown womanly weakness, just the kind of inadequate “mental and physical stamina” that Trump diagnosed in the briefly sick Clinton. Not long after Trump’s victory, one of his UK supporters, a backbencher with an ardent interest in unequal uniform-wearing, was voted, by fellow Tories, on to the Commons women and equalities committee. Although there is more to say about Philip Davies, and his mission to convince a parliament that is 29% female (49th in world rankings), that men’s views are underrepresented, all the little girls watching might want to consider instead the distinguished public servants who thought it would be the year’s crowning joke to elect him. Never doubt, even with a woman leader, the number of powerful men who still begrudge little girls every chance and opportunity in the world.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/01/all-little-girls-out-there-2017-better-year','To all the little girls out there, let 2017 be a better year for you | Catherine Bennett',200,'commentisfree'),('society/2017/jan/01/digital-detox-teenagers-pioneering-camp','One of Britain’s first “digital detox” companies is planning to expand its programmes to include teenagers as concern grows at the number of young people apparently unable to withdraw from the online world. The website of Time To Log Off offers punters the chance “to reconnect with the world offline, leaving you relaxed and energised to return to your daily life”. So far it has specialised in detox breaks for adults, but its first teenage weekend will open in Somerset during the Easter holidays. Founder Tanya Goodin has toured secondary schools to talk to children about managing their online time in a healthier way. “More and more have been coming up to me and asking ‘How do I know if I’m addicted?’” she said, “and ‘How much time is too much time online?’ A bit of logging off and mindfulness before they launch into the summer exam season ought to be a good experience.” Goodin carried out a survey of more than 500 young people aged 13 to 18. Of those, 29% said they spent more than eight hours a day online while 36% admitted they regularly fell asleep with their phone or laptop in bed. Two-thirds (67%) said they went to their phone when they were bored and nearly 60% revealed they used their phone as a crutch in an uncomfortable social situation. Eliza, 16, a year 11 pupil in Hampshire, is one of those keen to sign up. She is currently revising for her mock GCSEs, but is struggling to get anything done. The problem, she says, is that she cannot stay off her phone for more than 20 minutes. “I’m constantly checking it and flicking through stuff. I wish I could bring myself to delete all my apps, or just turn the phone off, but I can’t. It’s quite scary,” she says. “Once you get into the habit you’re always waiting – there’s always a set amount of ‘likes’ you’re trying to get. There’s always certain standards you have to meet. There’s a lot of pressure in that sense.” Getting children off screens is already big business in China. Places like Beijing’s Daxing Internet Addiction Treatment Centre, founded by a former officer in the People’s Liberation Army, are run more like military boot camps than retreats. The children are woken at 5am and there is a focus on discipline, obedience and silence (sometimes even solitary confinement). “The kids get dragged there kicking and screaming”, says Goodin, who says her camps will take a softer approach. Activities will focus on team building, silent walks and creative pastimes like photography, painting and cookery. As with her adult retreats, the teenagers will be required to leave all their devices at the door. “I imagine it will be quite bad tempered and snarly to start with,” she says. “The first&nbsp;24 hours are the most difficult but then I expect them to adapt very quickly.” At £500 for a three-night stay, it will not be accessible to all. “It’s only going to happen for children with parents who are switched on enough to care, or able enough to afford it,” says Shelagh O’Connell, head of English at a prominent west London school. O’Connell, who has been teaching English for 20 years, has seen a major dip in the attention span of her pupils over the past five years and believes much of it is down to a rampant social media culture. “The children have to be plugged into their social feed all the time, so they’re caught in a bubble,” she says. Pupils are less able to memorise poetry verses, take dictated notes in class or even make simple observations, like describing the colours of autumnal leaves. “Teaching has become focused on keeping kids’ attention and always having visuals in front of them,” she says. O’Connell agrees with Goodin that children are more clued up about technology dependency than many adults give them credit for. One of her pupils was so concerned about failing a series of crucial exams that he gave her his mobile phone for safe keeping between Easter and study leave, she says. “He was coming in well slept and polite, and he didn’t ask for it back,” adds O’Connell. “He passed the exams and his mother was really grateful to me because she hadn’t had to battle him at home.” So should schools be looking at their own digital detox initiatives, especially around exam times? Dr Richard Graham, a consultant psychiatrist at the Nightingale hospital in London, thinks so. Digital detox retreats in Somerset will be good for “washing out the toxins,” he says. But schools need a “system-wide approach, with clean times and clean zones where everyone switches off”. With exams looming, Eliza, for one, would welcome something that forces her to resist her social media impulses. “It all started off as a place to make new friends, but it’s turned into something that’s more about seeking validation,” she says. “I don’t know why I put myself through it.”','https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/01/digital-detox-teenagers-pioneering-camp','‘Digital detox’ aims to help teenagers reconnect offline',201,'society'),('news/2017/jan/01/observer-big-issue-local-government-spending-cuts','In your editorial on local spending (18 December) you suggest that “those who live in Salford [will] have a radically different level of service provision compared to those who live in Surrey”. While I understand the general reasoning behind this, I’m not sure that it will be true of this particular county. Residents are reeling from news of a whole range of cuts, including: • The closure of the most heavily used fire station in the area. • The ending of key bus services. • Much reduced support for the elderly. It is reliably estimated that to keep existing services going, the county would have raise its council tax by 18%. So the north-south divide is not total. Rev Andrew McLuskey Stanwell, Staines Surrey Your leader presented a highly inaccurate view of their impact [local spending cuts] on Hampshire and of the public sector spending picture nationally. It claimed that between 2009/10 and 2016/17, Hampshire has only had to cut spending by 5% (£47m). The government has cut Hampshire county council’s revenue support grant funding between these years by £159m (73.5%), together with a specific grant cut of a further £34m. Like many other south coast counties, we have a high percentage of elderly residents, so our adult social care pressures are particularly high. We were already a “low council tax, low grant” authority before the spending cuts began and, consequently, the impact of reductions on our overall position is relatively greater. The leader also gave the impression that local government spending is higher in areas perceived as affluent. The reverse is the case. In 2017/18, the combined county and district council spending power per household in Basingstoke will be just £1,452. This contrasts with £1,804 in Salford, £1,812 in South Tyneside and £1,876 in Oldham. The more generous spending levels in metropolitan areas are because government funding formulas have long and unfairly favoured metropolitan over rural areas. The methodology used in the figures from the Institute for Fiscal Studies does not take into account that £44m of our 2016/17 budget is funded from reserves. This is thanks to prudent management of our reserves, which has meant we can weather the storm, but the use of reserves can never be a long-term solution, so the IFS methodology masks the scale of cuts we face. The scale of the funding reductions we are facing means in no sense has Hampshire been let off the hook over severe reductions in grants. This is made even more challenging by the low level of funding we had to begin with. This analysis is inaccurate and misleading; worse, it does a disservice to the thousands of people in the south who are also heavily dependent on public services. They count too. Cllr Roy Perry Leader, Hampshire county council Winchester Well done on highlighting the devastating affect that the savage austerity cuts are having on local council budgets. These unnecessary and probably politically motivated swingeing cuts are affecting many much-valued community assets and properties. In north-west Leicestershire, we have seen the closure of the excellent, innovative and educational Snibston Discovery Park and its associated mining museum, all sold off for a new housing development. With Leicestershire county council facing another £68m of cuts over the next five years, we are working hard to save our century-old Thringstone House community centre. We are going to have to find an extra £20,000-plus a year to keep the centre going. We have already lost the funding for adult education classes, the youth leader and youth club and summer holiday play scheme. We provide everything for our village and local area, from the nursery pre-school to the retired people’s fellowship, as well as rooms and facilities for 30 clubs, societies and organisations, including an excellent drama society. These cuts are having an insidious, corrosive and crumbling effect on our communities, they are impoverishing society generally and storing up social problems for the future.

This is partly because it fails to understand the lessons of history and partly because it has no idea what the future holds. The year 2016, now finally at an end, underscored this basic human dilemma. It was a year in which long-gestating problems came to a head. With greater understanding of what had gone before, unexpected and terrible events, such as the barbaric climax to the war in Syria, the election of Donald Trump and Britain’s vote to leave the European Union, might not have been so shocking. At the same time, their full impact, which will begin to be felt in the new year just beginning, is fundamentally unknowable. Uncertainty is 2017’s watchword, inspiring a sense of trepidation and deep foreboding. Yet take a step back and it is plain that this gloomy outlook is not the whole story, that it is too easy to get things out of perspective. Every day, today included, thousands of healthy babies will be born around the world to families who, in most cases, are more able to care for their children than were their own parents and their parents before them. Every week in 2016 seemed to bring news of medical discoveries that will potentially help fight diseases such as cancer and dementia. In the hottest year on record, there were significant advances in environmental protection, including the Paris climate change agreement, the 170-country Kigali pact on cutting greenhouse gases and the creation of the world’s largest marine park, in the Ross Sea in Antarctica. Although the UN reports that the global total of refugees rose by 5 million people in 2016, many among the world’s record numbers of displaced, homeless and distressed found safe haven, were given asylum in third countries or were assisted by myriad agencies and charities. Many in need benefited from what the Queen, in her Christmas message, called “ordinary people doing extraordinary things: volunteers, carers, community organisers and good neighbours”. Every day saw acts of love and kindness, unreported and unremarked. Although the 2016 talk was mostly of tumult, terror and division, in Colombia the world’s longest-running insurgency was brought to a peaceful, negotiated conclusion. In Cuba, the revolution came in from the cold even as its leader, Fidel Castro, departed. In Burma, democrats took charge. The bigger picture emerging from 2016 is distorted, too, by some unsettling intellectual ideas. Chief among them is the suggestion that the era of globalisation, meaning ever-greater interaction and interdependency of peoples and nations, is drawing to a close. This argument proceeds in large part from a possible return to trade protectionism, hard borders and curbs on free movement of labour. Another fashionable thesis concerned the advance of populist or nativist forces, however defined, by which exponents seemed to mean the uncomfortable political shifts resulting from the supposedly anti-democratic, illiberal rise of the economically “left behind”. Yet both phenomena are open to more positive interpretations. Those on the left, in particular, argue that globalisation, while undoubtedly benefiting developing countries, has exacerbated the exploitative tendencies of multinational capitalism, increasing inequality and social disparities. A rebalancing is long overdue. At the same time, the idea that global interconnectivity can somehow be reversed in the age of ubiquitous social media, internet and mobile communication is fanciful. Similarly, what one person might see as threatening populism could be another’s electrifying opportunity. For years, politicians and pollsters have bemoaned lack of public engagement born of alienation and disillusion. Logically, they should celebrate the more vigorous grassroots involvement recently seen in Britain and parts of Europe. How such forces are channelled and directed is one of 2017’s bigger uncertainties. In Britain, the stormy aftermath of June’s EU referendum has given way to uneasy stalemate. Theresa May’s government appears caught in a state of fearful paralysis, deeply unsure about how to proceed, even as its self-imposed March deadline for triggering Brexit approaches. With the supreme court due to deliver its verdict this month on parliament’s role, May continues to discourage rigorous public scrutiny of her negotiating strategy. It is ever more embarrassingly clear that this is because, beset by conflicting advice, enormous bureaucratic complexities and cabinet divisions, she cannot decide what her strategy actually is. May’s stance is both undemocratic, as Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn pointed out last week, and untenable in the longer run. A looming question is whether May will resort to a general election to bolster her faltering position. Britain’s voters might not welcome such a move. Far from still being energised by last summer’s furious Brexit debate, they appear to have subsided into a grumpy, surly mood of resignation and suspicion. Remainers see every price rise, investment warning and European snub as grist to their “told you so” mill. Leavers view every suggestion of even the most minor compromise with Brussels as proof of imminent Brexit betrayal. There seems little doubt, following sterling’s devaluation (with worse to come in March) that the cost of living will rise sharply for most households during 2017. There is little doubt also that this negative trend will be compounded by rising global oil prices. And there can be little confidence that, when her demand for separate single market access for Scotland is shunted aside, Nicola Sturgeon will resist the temptation to call another independence referendum. For the Scottish Nationalists, breaking up the United Kingdom is a natural consequence of breaking up with the EU. For Europe as a whole, 2017 promises to be a torrid year. As we have discussed here previously, it will be the turn of French voters to express their anti-establishment anger in presidential and parliamentary polls this spring. The alarming result could be the replacement of François Hollande by the Front National’s anti-EU, anti-immigrant Marine Le Pen. A similar regression is conceivable in the Netherlands in March, and even in Germany in September, where Angela Merkel will seek a fourth term as chancellor. What all these contests have in common, if the centre cannot hold and progressive politicians fail to make their case, is the possible misdirection of eminently understandable, popular discontent with politics as usual into support for far-right, xenophobic and extreme nationalist forces. Successes for these groups could threaten the survival of a European Union already battered by Britain’s defection, eurozone stresses, mass migration and external threats. And any repeat of Islamist terrorist attacks similar to those in Berlin, Nice and Brussels will add to this existential strain. Terrorism aside, the biggest external threat to Europe is presented by Vladimir Putin. 2016 was a good year for Russia’s belligerent president. His intervention in Syria saved the barbaric regime of Bashar al-Assad and, with the fall of Aleppo, turned the course of the war. Now Putin, with Turkey and Iran, his current allies of convenience, is posing as peacemaker to the exclusion of the US. Putin has been boosted by Trump’s election. Barack Obama’s attempt to impose a penalty for Russia’s cyber-meddling in the US polls may not outlive the 20 January inauguration. Instead, the new American president is expected to seek some kind of old-fashioned, great power accommodation with Moscow. That in turn would be bad news for Nato and, in particular, its eastern European members that only emerged from Russia’s cold war sphere of influence in the past 20 years. For the EU, facing a Russian military build-up along its Baltic’s frontiers, Putin poses a growing problem in 2017. Putin’s Syrian ceasefire efforts will not defuse acute tensions affecting the entire Middle East region. Two factors – the continuing fallout from the 2011 Arab spring revolts and the decline in American leverage and engagement under Obama – will continue to have unpredictable consequences. The war in Yemen is very far from over. Much of Libya remains in a state of anarchy. Iran’s rivalry with Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies is likely to intensify following Tehran’s Syrian success and, with it, the broader Sunni-Shia schism. It is this religious fault line that sustains the foul jihadis of Islamic State, feeds lethal extremism and terrorism from Nigeria to Bangladesh and contributes to a destructive polarisation across the Muslim world. There is scant reason to believe the next 12 months will bring substantial improvement. If 2017 is indeed the year of uncertainty, then the biggest, new contributory factor is Donald Trump. Rarely, if ever, in our lifetimes has the advent of an American president aroused such a widespread sense of foreboding. Trump’s extraordinary combination of ignorance, aggression and personal insecurity threatens the post-1945 system of law-based universal values and international institutions. He shows nothing but contempt for the UN. But where else, in this dangerous world, can international disputes be peacefully addressed, however imperfectly, or humanitarian crises managed? With his praise of torture and hostility to the media, Trump encourages human rights abusers and enemies of free speech everywhere. With his loose talk about encouraging a nuclear arms race, Trump endangers global security and justifies the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, not least by the rogue regime in North Korea. With his climate change denial, noisily echoed by his cabinet and government agency nominees, Trump threatens a historic setback for the cause of environmental protection at the very moment when the polar ice is melting at record speeds. Trump’s thoughtless baiting of China, particularly over Taiwan, demonstrates what is fast becoming trademark behaviour: recklessness mixed with stupidity. Even the Taiwanese are alarmed at his antics. And while US concerns about China’s illegal military island building in the South China Sea are justified, tweeted insults aimed at Beijing are not the way to deal with the problem. Like the year 2017 itself, Trump’s presidency may not turn out to be as bad as feared. Practical considerations, wise advice and the limitations of US power may temper his worst instincts and wilder ideas. That is an outcome devoutly to be wished. But one international flashpoint deserves particular attention: the developing conflict between Israel and Iran. Reacting to last week’s Occupied Territories settlements row between Obama and Israel’s hawkish prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump pledged unquestioning support to the latter. At the risk of inflaming regional opinion, he has already indicated de facto recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s undivided capital. His new ambassador is militantly pro-settler, regardless of the rights of the Palestinians. And Trump himself has vowed to tear up last year’s nuclear accord with Tehran, which Netanyahu believes fundamentally threatens Israel’s security. Trump shows every sign of buying into the hard-right narrative, encouraged by Washington’s Sunni allies and Israeli hawks, that Iran, on the front foot in Iraq, Syria and Yemen, freed from oil sanctions, and allegedly secretly seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, must be stopped at all costs. This is extremely dangerous thinking that should be firmly resisted by Britain and all the western democracies. Whatever 2017 brings, the very last thing the world needs is another war in the Middle East.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/01/observer-view-on-2017','The Observer view on the prospects for 2017 | Observer editorial',203,'commentisfree'),('tv-and-radio/2017/jan/01/steven-knight-peaky-blinders-taboo-risky-period-drama','There are historical dramas, and then there are historical dramas written by Steven Knight. The 57-year-old creator of cult gangster drama Peaky Blinders has built a reputation as the man to go to for a risky period piece, and that is certainly the case with his latest show, Taboo, which starts on BBC1 on Saturday. It’s the tale of James Keziah Delaney (Tom Hardy), a Georgian adventurer with a very dark past who returns from America on his father’s death and promptly finds himself up to his neck in intrigue, murder and revenge. Taboo might not feature Peaky Blinders’ beguiling mix of modern music and sharp fashion, but Knight’s muscular, colourful and occasionally shocking script ensures that it is very much hewn from the same rock, although the writer insists he is not simply aiming for outraged headlines. “I hope it will have the sort of loyalty that Peaky does and I think people will be surprised by it,” he says. “It’s definitely a different way of doing English period drama. Not that there’s anything wrong with how it’s done at the moment, but I wanted to make something that felt more unfamiliar. I felt why not tell this story, not for any political reason but because it’s there and it hasn’t really been told.” The story he is referring to is the beginnings of industrialisation and the start of what would eventually become the Victorian empire. Taboo is set during the regency of the future George IV, but Knight is clear that the seeds of change were already being sown. “I see it as a story not about class but about commerce,” he says. “The history of Britain has always been written through the prism of class, and that’s fine, but the 19th century was driven by money and this story reflects that. This is a drama about the ships and money and warehouses and docks that formed the engine of the empire.” However, he cautions against drawing too many parallels between the expansionist East India Company, whose often malign influence is felt throughout the series, and today’s corporations. “It is a modern story because it’s about big business and corporate enterprise but I’ve tried not to make it simply ‘the East India Company were evil’ because that’s so easy to do. They did things that we now know to be evil, but if you want to learn anything from it you have to understand that they were human beings like us. They were capable of both good and bad.” This sense of the past as a shifting beast made up of many stories and personalities is key to Knight’s view of history. “We tend to believe that history goes in straight lines but it doesn’t,” he says. “We look back and believe that history tells the story of how we gradually became more permissive but the reality is that history goes in circles and if you look at the morality of 1814 [when Taboo is set] it’s much more hedonistic and libertarian than the 1960s. It was all going on.” Put like that, it is easy to see the appeal of a drama set in Georgian England – and why the subject looks set to be big news in 2017: in addition to Taboo, ITV will air Harlots, starring Samantha Morton and Lesley Manville as 18th-century brothel owners, later this year, while Jake Arnott’s new book, The Fatal Tree, published next month, tells the story of Georgian pickpocket Edgworth Bess and her lover, the notorious thief, Jack Sheppard. “Before the Victorian era, England was much more of a wild place,” Knight says. “And I think that when you take away the safe harbours that you normally expect in this kind of period drama – lady so-and-so meets with lady so-and-so – then you end up with something very different.” How does he feel about the fact that the series has already been described as the anti-Poldark, with both dramas featuring brooding leading men who return home after long absences to claim what they believe to be theirs? Knight laughs. “I’ve honestly never watched Poldark but I’m sure it’s brilliant. To make something commercially popular is actually very difficult and people love Poldark so they’re obviously doing it right.” And for all Taboo’s boundary-pushing (the show is definitely more Deadwood than Downton Abbey), Knight is clear that he doesn’t dislike straightforward historical dramas; indeed, his script for 2007’s Amazing Grace, about William Wilberforce and the abolitionist movement, was a more conventional affair, while the recent second world war drama Allied, starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard, deliberately harks back to the romantic epics of the 1940s and 50s. “There’s nothing wrong with the classic ways of adapting stuff,” he says. “It’s absolutely fine. But I don’t think that just because most people do it one way doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t try another. Taboo certainly isn’t a commentary on other types of period drama. It’s just a different way of tackling one.” Yet it is also the case that Knight is beginning to build quite a reputation as a creator of alternative period dramas. Peaky Blinders had Nick Cave and PJ Harvey on the soundtrack and gave a bunch of small-time crooks from 1920s Birmingham a mythic outlaw sheen. Taboo is equally full-blooded, thrusting the audience straight into a grimy Georgian London where anything and anyone is for sale. “I think audiences like to see characters that they can identify with presented with a different set of rules, which they certainly [have] with Taboo because of the period in which it’s set,” Knight explains. “It’s not familiar and there’s a simmering tension, yet there are some recognisable aspects. It’s like playing a computer game in a wild west setting – you play the game and it’s the same game you’ve always played but the setting is different so what does that mean for how you play?” And for all their risk-taking, his dramas are meticulously researched. “I read lots of history before writing this, everything from books about that specific time to Henry Mayhew’s London Labour and the London Poor which covers a later period. I wanted the smell of London and how it was, and first-hand accounts are best for that. The key is in finding individuals who will give you a good sense of the history – for example, we have an American spy in Taboo in later episodes who’s based on a real person. He was a spy and also a surgeon at St Barts, plus his hobby was dyeing cotton to find the best dye. We used the whole thing because it was so weird. I’m sure viewers will say it’s almost too much but it was all drawn from real accounts.” Having said that, he remains resigned to the fact that not everyone will be convinced. “I always get people saying about Peaky Blinders that there were no Peakys after 1908. Well, either my entire family were making it up or they existed after that time because they know that in the 1920s people were referred to as ‘Peaky Blinders’,” he says. “In history there’s what’s written down and there’s what actually happened. There are always people who are doing things that don’t fit the official accounts.” So would it be fair to describe Knight’s television dramas as a form of alternative history, dealing with those stories that can’t be contained or easily explained away? He nods. “Yes, exactly. Historians like to find patterns because that’s their job, they want a pattern that can be referred back to, or to view an event as part of a bigger pattern, but for people living their lives during that time it’s not like that.” Knight is currently writing the fifth episode of the fourth series of Peaky Blinders, which will return in October – “it’s going to be really good, the best yet, they’re having to step back and go back to their roots” – and has recently written screenplays for The Girl in the Spider’s Web – based on David&nbsp;Lagercrantz’s sequel to the Millennium series of novels by Stieg Larsson that started with The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo – and a western, Woman Walks Ahead, starring Jessica&nbsp;Chastain. As for the future, there’s at least one other historical period he’d like to give the Knight touch. “I’d really love to do something early medieval,” he says, before pausing and adding with a laugh: “I basically want to do Lady Godiva but I don’t quite know yet how to stretch it out.” Taboo is on BBC1 on Saturday 7 January at 9.15pm','https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/01/steven-knight-peaky-blinders-taboo-risky-period-drama','From Peaky Blinders to Taboo, how TV’s history man is shaking up period drama',204,'tv-and-radio'),('commentisfree/2017/jan/01/predictions-for-2017-inscotland','There are many reasons why I feel I must review my exposure to, and deployment of, social media in 2017. Not the least of these is all those long pronouncements that people insist on handing down on why 2016 was a bastard of a year. These windy sermons are written in the style of the Gettysburg address and can cover anything from the denouement of so many celebrities to the bad attitude of a rogue check-out assistant at Tesco. People who seemingly have no problem with the UK government’s immigration policies or who think we should be cracking down hard on benefit cheats while ignoring corporate tax avoidance nevertheless insist on telling the rest of us why Donald Trump and Brexit have made 2016 such a disastrous year. And while I can only sympathise with the families of George Michael, David Bowie and Prince for their sad losses in 2016, I dislike how their deaths, in the eyes of otherwise sane people, renders the year a bad one. For those ordinary people who had to mourn the deaths of their own loved ones, the death of a distant A-lister doesn’t make the year any worse. The year 2016 was a momentous one, but it wasn’t significantly better or worse than most other years. I predict that 2017 will be just as momentous as 2016 and that quite a lot of famous people will die during its course. Don’t hold me, though, to any of the following predictions about how the year will unfold. In February, following a long campaign by the Humanist Society in Scotland, the SNP government will pass a law making it an offence for parents to compel their children to walk past churches without offering them at least two other route options. A Scottish government spokeswoman says: “Scotland is a diverse and inclusive country but we can’t have impressionable young minds exposed to ideas about unconditional love and turning the other cheek to your enemies.” Patrick Harvie, a co-convener of Scotland’s Green party welcomes the move and reveals that plans are well advanced to force broadcasters to provide a warning before screening any programmes that depict Christian worship. This March, a proposal will be unveiled that is expected to lead to a long-awaited revolution in Scottish football. From now on, no person will be admitted to a Scottish Football Association (SFA) coaching course until he can first demonstrate that he can walk and talk at the same time. This is expected to disqualify about 90% of Scottish football’s youth coaches and ensure that the international team can begin the task of reducing the gap between ourselves and the likes of Benin and Mali. An SFA spokesman says: “Passing the ball quickly to members of your own team has long been recognised as a fundamental principle of the modern game and we feel that Scotland is now ready to embrace this concept.” After Scotland’s local government elections in May 2017, not a single council will remain under Labour’s control. In Glasgow, they will come in third behind the Tories. Kezia Dugdale, the Labour leader in Scotland, says: “In retrospect, the decision to hand out free union jack mugs to the party faithful bearing the slogan ‘Socialism Is for Losers’ might have upset our core vote in working-class areas.” June will be a quiet month, but it will end with the news that Nigel Farage has been successful in his application to become a bellhop at Trump Tower after his intense lobbying of the newly installed US president. “I feel I can be just as effective a lickspittle in US/UK relations as Tony Blair and Margaret Thatcher were,” he says. The summer will see the revelation of an explosive email exchange between the offices of two senior SNP strategists. “Look, [name redacted], I want independence for Scotland as much as the next chiel, but almost 200 special advisers aren’t far away from collecting their pensions. Independence could see us booted out of government and the chaps losing out on some entitlements. NS advice is just to keep hiding behind Brexit.” What can it all mean? The nation will be in mourning in September after Edinburgh loses its status as a Unesco world heritage site. The development comes after Edinburgh city council plans to erect a giant concrete wheelie bin at the east end of Princes Street, which will entirely overshadow Calton Hill. “We feel that this conveys a message about Edinburgh’s commitment to the environment. The concrete will be sculpted in a Greek, neoclassical style, in keeping with other buildings on Calton Hill,” a spokesman explains. In November, it’s revealed that a senior figure in Scottish Labour has opted not to accept a seat in the Lords. The figure, whose name is known to the Observer, is believed to be in hiding in a safe house after he tells shocked party executive members of his decision. Lord Foulkes of Cumnock says: “We feel this sets a bad precedent for the party. The House of Lords has been a traditional escape route for failed Scottish Labour politicians.” Theresa May’s festive initiative to provide help for homeless people at Christmas has been welcomed by Ruth Davidson leader of the Scottish Tories. Following the news of a steep rise in the number of people sleeping rough in the UK, Mrs May has made a nationwide appeal for people not to throw out their cardboard gift boxes this Christmas, suggesting that homeless people could make use of them. Ms Davidson says: “People are sleeping rough because they are scared stiff of a second independence referendum, but this initiative from the Compassionate party will provide warmth and comfort to many. “I’m donating the cardboard box that my new American fridge-freezer arrived in,” she adds, saying this could “easily sleep a family of four”.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/01/predictions-for-2017-inscotland','My fellow Scots, I have seen the future, so read on… | Kevin McKenna',205,'commentisfree'),('theobserver/2017/jan/01/male-victims-of-abuse-need-protection','Although I support Barbara Ellen’s criticism of Philip Davies’s filibustering (“Brevity is the soul of wit, Mr Davies, so put a sock in it”; Comment), I believe it pales into insignificance against the underlying subject of supporting male victims of domestic abuse. Quite rightly, the last 30 years have seen improvements in support and resources for female victims of domestic abuse, but those for males have lagged far behind, verging on the non-existent, beyond a helpline. Ellen says that amendments to the bill could be made later. The Council of Europe states that “parties to the Convention are encouraged to apply the protective framework it creates to men who are exposed to violence”. Such nebulous options are far less likely to be pursued and a mandatory agenda needs to be laid down. Dr John Trounce Hove, East Sussex No justification for child labour With regard to the article, “UN’s ban on child labour is a ‘damaging mistake’” (News), I was aware of this line of thought in academic and activist work, advocating greater flexibility of – or even elimination of – child labour regulations, on the grounds of the socioeconomic and cultural specificity of the settings where children end up in work environments. Authors resort to arguments relating to children’s rights, cultural relativism, social constructions of childhood and empirical evidence of the benefits of child work. Yet the strength of such arguments is generally overestimated and deeply questionable and, in many respects, they can be similarly used to justify the prohibition of child labour. As I have argued extensively elsewhere, it is essential to retain a restrictive approach to child work. This is particularly the case in the European context, on the basis of legal, social, economic and cultural factors, especially since the socioeconomic crisis that began in 2008, and both the European Union and the UK have a clear role to play. The same can be argued in relation to other regions. Some interventions by international agencies and foreign aid donors have had negative side-effects for not taking into consideration the local context and failing to implement a more appropriate range of supportive measures. That should not be used to question the appropriateness of the prohibition of child work of a certain type and until a certain age. Complexity cannot foster complacency. Although the proponents of relaxing the rules on child labour may not wish to do so, they may be favouring irresponsible deregulation and excessive neoliberal economic practices. Nuno Ferreira Professor of law, University of Sussex A way to save a town hall Chris Currer is absolutely right when he says of the disposal of Hornsey town hall that “Haringey council’s choice seems to hinge mostly on the money” (“Cities paying the price of austerity”, News). The tragedy is that there is a workable and sustainable alternative that this doctrinaire-driven cabinet refuses to discuss – a community asset transfer to a trust. This would allow full restoration of this wonderful building, the provision of social and affordable housing, community use and an arts centre, as well as relieving the council of its cost. Instead, it has gone for the luxury housing and boutique hotel model that will impress their developer chums but cut no ice with the thousands of homeless families in Haringey who will be spending the holiday season in temporary accommodation. David Winskill Hornsey Town Hall Appreciation Society and CIC, London N8 Pointlessness of privatisation Thank you to David Mitchell for expressing so well his opinions on the energy fiasco (“Change my power supplier? I haven’t got the energy”; New Review). Surely there couldn’t be a better example of how wildly inaccurate were the Tory claims in the 1980s of the advantages of privatisation of the energy industry. The assertion that it would lead to more competition, more choice and the forcing down of prices, can clearly be seen as a lot of hot air.

Simon Marlow-Ridley Hinckley, Leicestershire When silence was golden In your feature “Films that make comedians laugh” (New Review), it was striking that only one of the standups – Tim Key, who chose Harold Lloyd’s Safety Last! – cited a silent movie. Standup comedy today is all about production-line delivery of verbal humour, but the fact that the silent films of comic geniuses such as Chaplin and Keaton (whose The General would get my vote) don’t tickle the funny bone of most current “comedians” suggests that they need to go back to laughter school.

As Brexit Britain prepares to promote itself to the world, the government is pushing a global “GREAT” Britain campaign to showcase what the nation has to offer visitors. A central theme will be the diversity of British tourism as Wales promotes a Year of Legends, which will pay tribute to the country’s epic myths, and Scotland celebrates a Year of History, Heritage and Archaeology. England will celebrate a Year of Literary Heroes with notable milestones including the 20th anniversary of the first Harry Potter book – Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, the 200th anniversary of the death of Jane Austen and the 125th anniversary of the first Sherlock Holmes collection. Other major anniversaries that it is hoped will put Britain on the world’s cultural map include the 75th anniversary of Enid Blyton’s Famous Five and the 150th anniversary of Arnold Bennett’s birth in Stoke-on-Trent. Hampshire, where Austen spent most of her life, is promoting a series of events across the year, while Bath, which she visited frequently, is hosting its annual week-long festival celebrating her life. Austen-fever is likely to be matched by Pottermania when a new exhibition at the British Library, dedicated to the magic of Harry Potter, will be the first of its kind to celebrate a single series of books by a living author. The exhibition will include previously unseen material from author JK Rowling and the book’s publisher Bloomsbury, as well as other magic-related titles from the British Library’s own collection. To mark the 125th anniversary since Sir Arthur Conan Doyle published The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, fans are being encouraged to visit locations in London associated with the detective, and in Bristol where the BBC series starring Benedict Cumberbatch is filmed. The use of literary anniversaries to promote Britain abroad is proving a tried and tested method for tourism agencies. Last year, major anniversaries associated with Shakespeare, Beatrix Potter, Charlotte Brontë and Roald Dahl were used to lure foreign tourists through online marketing campaigns. VisitBritain, the national tourism agency, claims that for every £1 the government invests in marketing the UK abroad, an overseas visitor will spend £23 in Britain. Other key events this year include Hull becoming the UK’s City of Culture. Martin Green, CEO and director of Hull 2017, said it would be an opportunity to showcase the city to the world. “The ambition for Hull 2017 has been to create a year-long programme that speaks of the city, its people, their creativity and energy,” he pledged. On the sporting front, London will host the 2017World Athletics Championships and World Para Athletics Championships, while the ICC Champions Trophy will be held in Cardiff, London and Birmingham. The ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup final will be held at Lord’s, while the Women’s Rugby World Cup will be held in Belfast. This year will also see celebrations to mark the 25th anniversary of the Premier League. Forecasts from VisitBritain suggest 2017 will be a record year for inbound tourism as the weak pound encourages more people from overseas to holiday in the UK. Spending by overseas visitors is predicted to reach £24.1bn, an 8% increase on 2016, which is expected to top out at £22.3bn when official figures are published. The number of overseas visits is expected to rise to 38.1 million, up 4% on 2016, which is likely to see about 36.7 million visits by year end. This compares with predictions from an independent consultancy, Tourism Economics, which is forecasting a 6.7% increase in visits to the UK and a 5.8% increase in spending. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the value of the pound – which remains down more than 10% against the euro since the referendum – resulted in an upsurge in visitors last summer. Flight bookings data suggests that arrivals to the UK for November, December and early 2017 are also likely to be up year-on-year.','https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/jan/01/harry-potter-sherlock-holmes-promote-brexit-britain-2017','Harry Potter and Sherlock Holmes to promote Brexit Britain in 2017',207,'travel'),('lifeandstyle/2017/jan/01/taryn-brumfitt-embrace-women-body-image-ditch-diets','Many of us waking up will feel the familiar pang of New Year’s Day self-loathing and decide that this is the day to start that new diet, begin that new detox, finally attempt to get the body of our dreams. Within a month we will probably feel miserable, hungry and no closer to achieving our goal. Now a new film is set to challenge the increasingly pervasive message that there is one way to look by tackling the myth of the perfect body and the celebrity culture that fuels it. Embrace follows Australian writer and campaigner Taryn Brumfitt as she travels across the world talking to a huge variety of women about how they see themselves. She speaks to actor and talk-show host Ricki Lake about body image and Hollywood, to an entertainingly direct Amanda de Cadenet about what it was like living with tabloid scrutiny at the age of 18 (“The message I took from it was that if you were thinner you were better … these days I’d say if you want to eat the biscuit, eat the fucking biscuit”) and to Harnaam Kaur, a British Sikh woman who celebrates the beard caused by polycystic ovary syndrome rather than break her religious beliefs. Most movingly of all, the film introduces us to women who have seen their bodies change in dramatic ways, from Kirsty who lost a breast to cancer (“My boys think it’s cool, they’ve got a mum with one boob – it’s a bragging point”) to the inspirational Turia Pitt who suffered burns to 65% of her body when she was caught in a bush fire and who admits: “I’ve gone through something so huge … and I think, well, if I’ve managed to start my life from scratch then I’m not sure why other people can’t. That probably sounds a little bit harsh but it’s just how I feel.” “I made the film because I really wanted to have a conversation about this,” says Brumfitt. “I felt as though a lot of people behind closed doors felt the way I did – that they were being pressured to look a certain way and I wanted people to know that they’re not alone.” Brumfitt knows the price of striving for perfection. After the birth of her third child she became obsessed with regaining a pre-pregnancy figure and began a punishing weight-loss and exercise regime that culminated in competing in a bodybuilding contest. But despite having what society would claim was the perfect figure, she was desperately unhappy and decided to return to a more relaxed regime. One day she posted an online before-and-after picture, with a twist. The before picture was her at her thinnest, the happy after shot was Brumfitt as she was, carrying a few pounds yet content. “I thought it might help people but the response was mind-blowing,” she says. “It went viral and became this internet sensation and suddenly I found myself doing media across the world and talking about how women see their bodies.” Brumfitt swiftly realised that the brief chats she was doing on morning television were only scratching the tip of a very large iceberg. She started up the Body Image Movement to provide a forum for discussion but still wanted to do more. “I was hearing from all these women from all over the world and I knew this was a subject that needed a bigger platform so I nonchalantly thought, ‘Oh, I know, I’ll make a documentary, how hard can that be?’ And of course the answer was very.” It might have been hard but the result is compelling. Embrace delves into every aspect of body image pressure from the plastic surgeon who spends a large amount of time telling Brumfitt that her post-pregnancy nipples “should be up here” (“I took one for the team there,” she remarks drily) through the magazine editors who talk frankly about the way in which the perfect body is sold to the world. There are screenshots of the body shamers who contacted Brumfitt online after her pictures went viral, telling her she should be ashamed and that her husband must be devastated. “I really gave the audience the parental guidance version of that,” she admits with a laugh. “It bothered me at first but then I realised what’s the point? I feel great about my body. The more shocking thing was that no matter where I went in the world, body shaming and body hating was everywhere. It was like an epidemic and&nbsp;I found that heart-breaking and mind-blowing.” Certainly one of the most powerful moments in the film comes when Brumfitt asks women across the world how they feel about their bodies. They are a range of ages, body shapes and nationalities yet they all say they’re unhappy with how they look. “I feel as though I’m drowning in a sea of media,” announces a distressed mother talking about how hard it is to convince her teenage daughter that she doesn’t have to look a certain airbrushed way – and Embrace is at its strongest when it tackles how we collude in this objectification. “We live in a world where women are objectified and sexualised in advertising campaigns or on television on a daily basis,” says Brumfitt. “I really do hope that this film allows us to keep pushing back against the toxic ideal of perfection.” She has already had positive responses from some unlikely sources. “Quite a few men who have seen the film have contacted me and been so beautiful,” she says. “They’ve said things like, ‘I’ve told my wife for ever that I love her the way she is and I just don’t care about all the&nbsp;things she’s so worried about’. And that’s important because I don’t think this is just a women’s issue – it’s a problem for humanity.” Indeed, although Embrace was “made for women first and foremost”, Brumfitt says she’s increasingly aware of how many young boys are also suffering from body image problems. “There have been so many studies recently on the use of steroids in teenage boys – they’re under pressure to conform to a certain kind of muscled, manly stereotype as well and they’re equally bombarded with images of how they should look and behave.” Her main hope is that the uplifting Embrace will convince audiences to start treating their bodies as something to love rather than loathe. “Absolutely. We need to detox from the toxic messages we’ve allowed inside our minds for so long,” she says. “I want people to know that they do have a choice: you can either spend your life being at war with your body and hating it, dieting, shaming yourself, using exercise as punishment, or you can embrace your body, move it for pleasure and live an exciting and uninhibited, liberated life. I know which one I’d choose.” Embrace will be available in cinemas across the UK from 16 January','https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jan/01/taryn-brumfitt-embrace-women-body-image-ditch-diets','Ex-bodybuilder Taryn Brumfitt campaigns to ditch diets and end myth of the ideal shape\r\n',208,'lifeandstyle'),('science/2017/jan/01/dippy-diplodocus-london-tour-replica-dinosaur-whale-natural-history-museum','So farewell then, Dippy the Diplodocus. For more than a century the much-loved 26-metre long dinosaur skeleton has held centre stage at the Natural History Museum in London, captivating generations of children. But this is the last weekend of Dippy’s residency. On Wednesday the 292 plaster-cast bones that make up his splendid frame will be taken apart and packed up. After 112 years as the museum’s best-known prize exhibit, the country’s most famous diplodocus will embark on a farewell tour of the UK, following which there are no plans to put him on show. His replacement at the Natural History Museum will be the genuine skeleton of a young blue whale who died in 1891 on an Irish beach, around 152 million years after Dippy’s demise in the United States. As yet, the whale has no nickname – Bluey doesn’t really swing it. Dippy’s posthumous fame began in 1898 when railroad workers uncovered bones in the plains of fossil-rich Wyoming. The almost complete diplodocus was snapped up by Scots industrialist Andrew Carnegie for his Pittsburgh museum. King Edward VII saw a sketch of the beast on the wall at Carnegie’s Skibo Castle and promptly decided to build a replica. Creating the plaster cast cost Carnegie around £2,000 of his own money. The replica skeleton was shipped to the UK in 36 crates and went on display in London before the original had even been pieced together. Dippy was the first upright skeleton of a diplodocus ever to have gone on display. The Natural History Museum’s head of conservation, Lorraine Cornish, is in charge of Dippy’s delicate dismantling process: “The most important thing is that Dippy is off round the country,” she said, “where he will reach a huge number of people in these eight venues who are all so enthused and incredibly excited to have him. His first stop is in Dorset on the Jurassic coast, which is lovely and fitting. He is going to be such a great ambassador for the museum and for natural history and the natural&nbsp;world.” Taking Dippy apart will take around three weeks. “The plaster of paris is pretty fragile, it’s moulded round the armature at some points,” said Cornish. “It’s like a giant 3D puzzle or Meccano set, and it was never built to be dismantled. “The pelvis is particularly tricky. And the neck and tail is a bit like a necklace of pearls, but we do like a challenge. “We will miss Dippy, you do bond with these specimens, after all. And he is so iconic, it is about memories and people have such a strong affinity with him”. Part of the reasoning behind Dippy’s removal was a desire to highlight current conservation concerns. “It was a big decision” said Cornish, “looking at the whole strategy and priorities of a natural history museum and where we are going. We have so many stories to tell. The blue whale is original and we wanted a big specimen that would talk to the science. This is a species we hunted almost to extinction and then had the courage to attempt to bring back from the brink. It’s so very relevant. But we’re very happy that the whale will look very dramatic and bring a new story to visitors.” The blue whale has already been exhibited high up in another hall so may be familiar to some museum regulars. But her pose will be slightly altered now she is in the museum’s prime position. Dr Paul Barrett, as the leading paleontologist at the Natural History Museum, is also sorry to see Dippy go, but extols the authenticity of his successor. “There are a number of positives to Dippy going. He is a spectacular object and allowing people from outside London to see it is important. From my point of view there is a certain nostalgia, of course, but I’m not upset in scientific terms. He is always a replica, of research quality but a replica. In science, we’re always driving towards authenticity and real objects and that is what people want to see to connect with the natural world.” Replica or not, over the years there have been attempts to enhance Dippy’s authenticity. At one point, the arc of his long tail was lifted when science reviewed how the beast probably moved. Barrett emphasised that despite Dippy’s exit, dinosaurs remained hugely significant to modern scientific study. “One of the reasons dinosaurs are increasingly relevant is that they show that no matter how successful a species is, unexpected events can come along and completely wipe them out. They had no time to evolve or adapt. Enormously successful, living all over the world and a big rock from space knocks them out. “It’s a wake-up call to human arrogance. Some things you cannot predict and we are still vulnerable to being caught out. “We have a biodiversity crisis and things we cannot predict. So paleontology is a growing field, with more direct relevance now than ever. It’s not just about the evolution of life but also now about where we’re going.” Last week, a few visitors were paying their final respects. For nine-year-old Nathan Stretham, from Stroud, visiting Dippy has been a biannual event. “Since I was tiny I really, really loved dinosaurs. But diplodocus is my favourite. I think because I saw this one first. He’s the best thing.” Does he like whales though? Nathan’s reply is cautious. “Yes, but maybe I’ll like them more when I get too old for dinosaurs.” ‘FOSSIL’ HISTORY ■ Dippy arrived in London from America in 36 packing cases in 1905. His 292 bones took months to assemble and his unveiling that year at the Natural History Museum was an international coup. ■ During the second world war he was taken apart and stored for safety. ■ He was the first of 10 replicas - all funded by Andrew Carnegie and gifted to museums scattered across the globe. ■ The diplodocus was first identified as a species of sauropod dinsoaur in 1878 and named by Yale professor Othniel Marsh from the Greek diplos meaning double and dokos meaning beam. It lived between 156 and 145 million years ago, weighed around 13 tonnes and was likely a herbivore. ■ Dippy has had roles on television and in films including Paddington, One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing, and Night at the Museum 3. He has also been the star of innumerable tourist and family photographs.','https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jan/01/dippy-diplodocus-london-tour-replica-dinosaur-whale-natural-history-museum','Dippy’s last days: diplodocus leaves London after 112 years for farewell UK tour',209,'science'),('money/2017/jan/01/new-12-sided-pound-coins-royal-mint-currency','The new 12-sided £1 coin will enter circulation on 28 March and the old-style coin will be defunct by mid-October, the Treasury has announced. The government is launching a campaign to encourage the public to return the round coins. The Treasury estimates that £1.3bn of coins are being stored in savings jars, with £1 coins accounting for almost a third of these. They must be exchanged before 15&nbsp;October when they will cease to be legal tender. The first new £1 coin since 1983 is an attempt to end counterfeiting. It is estimated that 3% of the current coins in circulation are fake. The new coin will be the most secure in the world, it is claimed, with several security features, including a hologram. David Gauke, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said: “28 March should be an important date in everybody’s calendar – as we will have a new quid on the block. Our message is clear: if you have a round £1 coin you need to spend it or return it to your bank before 15 October.” About 40% of vending and other cash-receiving machines will have to be upgraded. The British Parking Association says each meter change will cost £90-£130 for the simplest software upgrade and considerably more if they are to issue change. The Royal Mint has put the cost of changing all the UK’s machines at £15m-£20m, although many experts believe this is optimistic. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said she believed businesses would be ready. “While there will be a natural transition period where some vending systems may only be able to accept the existing coin, our industry is committed to ensuring we’re fully prepared ahead of the launch.” The Royal Mint has produced more than 2.2bn round £1 coins since 1983, when it replaced the note. This was withdrawn in March 1988, but is still redeemable at the Bank of England. The Royal Mint will make more than 1.5bn of the new coins, whose design is based on the threepenny bit, which went out of circulation in 1971.','https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/jan/01/new-12-sided-pound-coins-royal-mint-currency','New quid on the block: round pound to be replaced by 12-sided coin in March',210,'money'),('lifeandstyle/2017/jan/01/observer-killer-sudoku','Normal Sudoku rules apply, except the numbers in the cells contained within grey lines add up to the figures in the corner.

The system, which began in July, has been the subject of a string of complaints in the past month, as anger grows over its crude use of data-matching to compare income reported to Centrelink with information held by the Australian tax office. Roughly 169,000 Australians, including those with disabilities, have now received letters from the government, warning them the data-matching has detected a discrepancy in their income information. Those individuals are given 21 days to prove they are eligible for welfare received up to six years ago, or they will incur a debt and a 10% “debt recovery fee”. If they fail to pay, individuals are referred to debt collectors, and the human services minister, Alan Tudge, has previously threatened them with jail. Porter defended the system on Tuesday morning, saying it was fair and reasonable, and that only 276 complaints had been received so far. “I think that this is about as reasonable a process as you could possibly derive,” Porter told ABC Radio National. A formal complaint, however, is different from lodging a dispute against a welfare debt. Porter would not say how many disputes had been lodged against welfare debts. He dismissed calls for the system to be suspended, saying it had now identified $300m of overpayments to welfare recipients. Porter said individuals who disagreed with Centrelink’s notice had plenty of opportunity to contest it. “Ultimately, if a real discrepancy does exist then eventually we raise a debt, and that happens much later than this initial letter, and even then, there are many days in which you can dispute that debt, if you think that a mistake has been made,” he said. “Then, when a repayment is arranged, it is arranged in a way that is financially suitable to the individual. “It really is an incredibly reasonable process, the question is why wasn’t the previous government, Labor, when they were in charge, engaging in this process.” He sought to clarify that the initial letters sent out to welfare recipients were not “debt letters”, despite the fact that, if not responded to, they will automatically lead to a debt. The data-matching process appears to suffer from two main errors. In some cases, it has been shown to have crudely averaged out ATO information on a person’s yearly income across all of Centrelink’s 26 fortnightly reporting periods. Queenslander Michael Griffin, for example, was taken to have earned $1,000 every fortnight because his annual income was $26,000. That does not take into account circumstances where a person has only worked for part of year, and is otherwise eligible for benefits. A Centrelink whistleblower previously told Guardian Australia that many of those contacted by the agency were simply paying the debt without question. The source, who reviewed hundreds of cases where disputes were lodged, said only about 20 had turned out to be genuine. Legal Aid Victoria also fears that many individuals are not receiving correspondence from Centrelink, and are being lumped with the debt by default. Others say long waiting times on Centrelink’s phone system or problems with its online portal have prevented them from lodging a dispute within 21 days.','https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jan/03/minister-defends-centrelink-over-welfare-debt-compliance-system','Minister defends Centrelink over welfare debt compliance system',213,'australia-news'),('football/2017/jan/03/van-t-schip-resigns-city-boss-valkanis-interim-coach','Melbourne City head coach John van ‘t Schip has stood down with immediate effect citing a desire to return to the Netherlands to care for his seriously ill father. The club released a brief statement on Tuesday in which they thanked Van ‘t Schip for his services to the club. “John’s reaction to his personal circumstances is testament to the man he is and why he has been such an important contributor to the club’s development both on and off the field – culminating in guiding our men’s first team to its maiden trophy. He has our ongoing gratitude and support as his focus rightly turns to his family,” said club chairman, City Football Group’s Khaldoon Al Mubarak. Assistant coach Michael Valkanis has been appointed interim first-team coach with immediate effect while the club conducts a search for a permanent replacement for Van ’t Schip. The Dutch former international was the inaugural head coach of the then Melbourne Heart, and spent six seasons at the club across two spells in charge, overseeing 144 A-League games with a win ratio of 36%. Van ‘t Schip guided Heart/City to three finals series appearances, winning the club’s first silverware earlier this season with a 1-0 victory over Sydney FC in the FFA Cup final. Commenting on his decision Van’t Schip said, “I have been faced with a choice between my family in Holland and my work here in Australia and there was only one right decision. “I did not want my personal circumstances to impact the club in any way. I am part of a strong coaching team that has been carefully nurtured over the last three years and that gives me great confidence that this situation will not adversely affect the club’s progress. “I would like to thank everyone at Melbourne City and the City Football Group for their support. The club’s development since its creation will always be a source of great personal pride to me.”','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/03/van-t-schip-resigns-city-boss-valkanis-interim-coach','John van \'t Schip resigns as Melbourne City boss, Valkanis interim coach',214,'football'),('books/2017/jan/02/adrian-searle-on-john-berger-art-for-him-was-never-apart-from-being-alive','I cannot overestimate John Berger’s importance to me. It wasn’t so much his critical opinions or insights I valued, so much as the man himself, whose vitality and receptiveness to the things about him had a force I have rarely encountered. It was his freedom as a writer I admired most. He had both backbone and playfulness, approaching things at tangents but always illuminating his subjects in unexpected and often disconcerting ways. In his groundbreaking 1972 television series, Ways of Seeing, Berger described the purposes of art, and artists’ intentions, in ways that felt flexible, undogmatic and grounded both in experience and in delight. He helped us look for ourselves, which is the best a critic can do. Berger provoked intense loyalties and animosities. There were those who saw his defence of vernacular art as waging war against modernism, a man fighting a rearguard action against all kinds of artistic progress. This was oversimplistic, as his writing shows. I got to know Berger largely through our mutual friendship with the late Spanish artist Juan Muñoz. In the mid 1990s Muñoz and Berger collaborated on a radio play, which won a big prize in Germany and in 2005 was turned into a stage production at the Casa Encendida in Madrid. Berger, acting the part of a radio chatshow host, fielded imaginary calls and talked about illusion and presence and Goya’s dog, while an elderly Turkish foley artist, seated on the edge of the stage, provided sound effects. Already almost 80, Berger performed under sweltering stage lights in the Madrid summer heat and never lost his cool. Although there were several other actors in the work, it was almost a solo performance. John carried it; he had presence. I asked Berger if he had ever wanted to be an actor and he admitted that he had been approached by an agent who encouraged him to go on the stage after seeing him perform in the annual Chelsea School of Art student revue. His stage presence and manner reminded me, disconcertingly, of Frankie Howerd. He was a natural and one of the reasons Ways of Seeing was so good was that he never came over as the patrician smart-arse superior critic. He made you feel he was thinking on his feet, right there in front of you. John would screw up his face and affect an expression somewhere between bewilderment and anguish, before launching into an argument that seemed to arrive fully formed. He was enormously compelling. He made me aware that writing itself was performative. He reminisced about his time sharing a Paris apartment with the young David Sylvester, who never let go of an early falling out. It had something to do with Berger’s complaints about Sylvester leaving his “voluminous underpants” draped over a chair in a shared room in the early 1950s. Sylvester, I always thought, was jealous of Berger’s abilities as a writer of fiction as well as of art, though his career-long public animosity was also about Berger’s left-wing politics and his championing of socially engaged art. It strikes me that art for Berger was the beginning of a journey of his own, a way of igniting responses and provoking thoughts. He approached art with a kind of innocent curiosity. He had enthusiasms I couldn’t share (from Soviet artist Ernst Neizvestny to British painter Maggi Hambling) but was open to work as diverse as Rachel Whiteread’s House and Muñoz’s enigmatic figurations. There are things I wish he had written on, but never did. If he was wrong about Picasso (whom he called a “vertical invader”, slicing through tradition) or just plain weird about Francis Bacon (whose paintings he once compared to Walt Disney animations – though Berger later revised his opinion) it didn’t matter. His ideas remained useful, because they always felt part of a bigger, ongoing conversation. It is healthy for a critic to beware of fixed opinions. Whatever he did, Berger was a teller of stories, and alert to the complexities of all kinds of art-making and writing. Dip into him anywhere – an essay on Courbet, on drawing hands, or Roman Egypt funerary portraiture – whatever it is, his subject is vivid on the page. His writing is filled with insights. That he trained as a painter gave him a sympathy and understanding of the act of making and its difficulties – rare among critics now. Intensely observant, Berger had the ability to focus the smallest quotidian detail – a penknife in a boy’s pocket, or a pear grown inside a bottle in a farmer’s orchard, bringing in the cows or sharpening a pencil – in order to tell us something about life and human relations, in an unending chain of acts and expressions. Everything he wrote has humour in it as well as sorrow. His writing never forgets the vagaries of the everyday. He revelled in all this. Art for him was never something apart from the business of being alive. He was grounded. He struck me as a man who was both supremely astute and perceptive, and a sentimentalist. He could be a wonderfully engaging companion. A 1983 television debate with Susan Sontag – both wrestling with what a story could be – remains electrifying, mostly because they were both struggling with thoughts and ideas rather than trading certainties. Always worth reading, even when one disagrees with him, Berger went his own way, which was the only way to go.','https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/02/adrian-searle-on-john-berger-art-for-him-was-never-apart-from-being-alive','Adrian Searle on John Berger: \'Art for him was never apart from being alive\'',215,'books'),('sport/blog/2017/jan/02/leicester-tigers-may-miss-richard-cockerill','As recently as Christmas Eve Richard Cockerill was still convinced there would be a happy end to Leicester’s season. “I’m not sure it’s all doom and gloom,” he said, fixing his inquisitors with his trademark piercing stare. “We’re fifth at the halfway stage of the season and I’d back ourselves to be in the play-offs.” His latter prediction may yet come true but Cockerill will not be the coach who makes it happen. It is always slightly depressing when a loyal club servant reaches the end of the road. Like dogs and their owners, rugby clubs and their coaches start to reflect each other over time and the Tigers may miss the faithful, boisterous “Cockers” more than they realise. It is almost exactly 25 years since the former England hooker first arrived at Welford Road as a player and barring a two-year stint with Montferrand in France, he has been loyal to a fault. If nothing else a Cockerill team would always be feisty, tough to beat at home and on their best days, capable of seeing off anyone. The problem for Cockerill, in the end, was that Leicester have been hitting those high spots sporadically. It is 15 years since they won the European Cup and, assuming they draw another blank in this season’s Premiership, they will have won the domestic title once in their past seven attempts. For a side with Leicester’s trophy-laden heritage, that is simply not good enough. Anyone who witnessed the Tigers’ heavy defeats at Glasgow, Munster and Exeter this season could also hardly fail to notice the grim, thousand-yard stares of the club’s hierarchy at every final whistle. These are men who seriously hate losing, particularly against teams who have prospered lately while they have been treading water. No club in Europe has higher expectations and the expert manner in which a head coach like Eddie Jones has transformed England’s fortunes inside 12 months will also have hardened attitudes. Leicester is a wonderful location to coach when the home team win but it is an unforgiving place when results go awry. In that regard Cockerill did well to survive for the amount of time he did. Neither Marcello Loffreda or Heyneke Meyer lasted long, unable to transform a setup that, for years, was allergic to change. Cockerill admitted as much to the Guardian last April: “Two or three years ago that probably was my mentality … this is what we do, this is how we do it and if you don’t fit in, tough.” The clannishness that made Leicester unbeatable in their heyday had started to become their achilles heel. In fairness to Cockerill, he ceased to be a lucky general some time ago. The injury list has been grim, with high‑profile overseas signings Matt Toomua and JP&nbsp;Pietersen, and the talismanic Manu Tuilagi, among the most obvious casualties. Other English sides, notably Saracens, Wasps and Bath, have been splashing more cash and Tigers have won only one knockout match at the sharp end of Europe since the summer of 2009. The board had already moved to remedy that situation by recruiting the more creative-minded Aaron Mauger but that marriage, promising on paper, has not worked out as hoped. There have been mutterings of mixed messages, not helped by the fact that a suspiciously high number of players have left Welford Road to prosper elsewhere. Cockerill can be great company but not every former employee posts him a Christmas card. What happens next will be pruriently fascinating. Mauger has been placed in interim charge but what if results do not pick up swiftly? Leicester face Wasps in Coventry this Sunday and, with traditional Midlands’ certainties suddenly null and void, there must be at least a possibility of another flogging. European qualification feels highly unlikely and the Six Nations period will rob the club of key England men such as Dan Cole and Ben Youngs. Maybe that is why the board acted slightly quicker than expected in parting company with Cockerill, in an attempt to buy everyone else a bit more time and avert total meltdown. Ironically, Leicester performed decently in several respects against Saracens, exhibiting no shortage of heart and effort, but there is little doubt they need an injection of fresh inspiration from somewhere. It makes the club’s latest managerial rejig crucial: do they look abroad as Munster have successfully done with Rassie Erasmus or do they revert togot for another of their own? Paul Gustard, Graham Rowntree, Dean Richards, John Wells, Martin Johnson, Clive Woodward … the list of former local heroes with experience of top-level coaching is lengthy. While half of the above will not be remotely interested, it is a indication of the times that all options will be painstakingly sifted. Cockerill’s immediate coaching future is uncertain – Northampton anyone? – but the Tigers’ next move is even harder to predict.','https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/jan/02/leicester-tigers-may-miss-richard-cockerill','Richard Cockerill pays price for barren spell but Leicester will miss his loyalty | Robert Kitson',216,'sport'),('us-news/2017/jan/02/rebecca-ferguson-says-she-will-play-trump-inauguration-if-she-can-sing-strange-fruit','Singer Rebecca Ferguson has said she would accept an invitation to perform at Donald Trump’s inauguration on 20 January on one condition: she be allowed to sing Strange Fruit. First recorded by Billie Holiday in 1939 and covered by Nina Simone in 1965, Strange Fruit is one of the nation’s most famous songs about racism. The lyrics by Abel Meeropol graphically describe the lynchings of African-Americans: Southern trees bear strange fruit Blood on the leaves and blood at the root Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees Ferguson – a British singer who became well-known after appearing on 2010’s X Factor in the UK, memorably performing Sam Cooke’s civil rights anthem A Change is Gonna Come – called Strange Fruit “a song that speaks to all the disregarded and down trodden black people in the United States” in a Twitter statement introduced with the words “inauguration ceremony” explaining that she would appear at Trump’s inauguration only if she could sing that song: I’ve been asked and this is my answer. If you allow me to sing Strange Fruit, a song that has huge historical importance, a song that was blacklisted in the United States for being too controversial. A song that speaks to all the disregarded and downtrodden black people in the United States. A song that is a reminder of how love is the only thing that will conquer all the hatred in this world, then I will graciously accept your invitation and see you in Washington. Best Rebecca X Trump has been struggling to get A-listers to appear at his inauguration. Elton John, Gene Simmons and Garth Brooks have all turned down invites, with many major artists aligning themselves with the Hillary Clinton campaign or not wishing to be associated with a Trump presidency. The president-elect did not respond to a question from the Guardian about whether Ferguson would be performing Strange Fruit at the inauguration. Below are 10 other songs that Trump might want to consider for his inauguration ceremony. 1. Immigrants (We get the Job Done) by K’naan, Snow Tha Product, Riz MC and Residente This tune from The Hamilton Mixtape (a reworking of songs from the Lin-Manuel Miranda Broadway musical about founding father Alexander Hamilton) will be recognizable to incoming vice-president Mike Pence, who famously went to see the musical just a few days after the election. The “immigrants: we get the job done” line usually gets the biggest cheer of the night in the live show, but this version also includes the following intro from a news broadcast: You know, and it gets into this whole issue of border security, you know, who’s gonna say that the borders are secure? We’ve got the House and the Senate debating this issue, and it’s ... it’s really astonishing that in a country founded by immigrants, “immigrant” has somehow become a bad word. So the debate rages on and we continue ... 2. Take the Power Back by Rage Against the Machine It’s a post-fact world, but this song from Rage Against the Machine’s eponymous 1992 debut album is a good reminder of the importance of personal political activism, with lyrics that seem like they could have been written today: So-called facts are fraud They want us to allege and pledge and bow down to their god Lost the culture, the culture lost Spun our minds and through time, ignorance has taken over 3. Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen Comedian Kate McKinnon’s performance as Hillary Clinton singing Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah directly after the election and Cohen’s death provided one of the election’s most powerful TV moments. 4. Ronnie, Talk to Russia by Prince This song – originally recorded by Prince as a plea to Ronald Reagan to reach peace with Russia and avoid nuclear war, with the lyrics “Ronnie, talk to Russia before its too late/Before they blow up the world” – might remind congressional Republicans of a time before a GOP president to be invited the country to hack his opponent’s emails and poured scorn on intelligence assessments about Russian hacking of a US election. 5. Respect by Aretha Franklin In the 19 October debate against Clinton, during which Trump’s Democratic opponent outlined his treatment of women and he called her a “nasty woman”, Trump declared that “nobody has more respect for women than I do”. Aretha Franklin singing her most famous hit might highlight that message, although the soul legend may well be reluctant to take part, having performed My Country Tis of Thee at Barack Obama’s inauguration in 2008. 6. Fight the Power by Public Enemy Public Enemy’s 1989 hit may prove a reminder to Trump of the importance of the first amendment, despite his vows to “open up” the libel laws to make it easier to sue the press, his blocking of reporters from his events, labelling them as liars on Twitter and encouragement of rally crowds to boo them: Our freedom of speech is freedom or death/We’ve got to fight the powers that be 7. Born this Way by Lady Gaga Pence, who many expect to see doing much of the day-to-day running of the Trump White House, has long been criticized for his attitudes towards LGBT communities and his tacit backing of so-called conversion therapy. Gaga’s Born This Way is a bit of a contrast to that approach: Don’t be a drag, just be a queen Whether you’re broke or evergreen You’re black, white, beige, chola descent You’re Lebanese, you’re Orient Whether life’s disabilities Left you outcast, bullied, or teased Rejoice and love yourself today ‘Cause baby you were born this way 8. Trump is on your Side by Moby and the Homeland Choir This bitterly sarcastic song by Moby suggests that Trump’s claims to care about American jobs and workers may not be totally sincere: “You’re all alone and you’re filled with fear / The billionaire says what you need to hear.” 9. I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor “Do you think I’d crumble / Did you think I’d lay down and die? / Oh no, not I / I will survive,” declares Gaynor in this 1978 classic, which became a gay pride anthem. 10. Changes by Tupac Shakur In this song first recorded in 1992 four years before his death, Tupac Shakur raps about being poor, black and battling racism, drugs, police brutality and the prison system, and declares that America is not ready for an African American president. Trump, who pushed himself as a ‘law-and-order’ candidate, could do worse than to give it a listen. And although it seems heaven sent We ain’t ready, to see a black President, uhh It ain’t a secret don’t conceal the fact The penitentiary’s packed, and it’s filled with blacks','https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/02/rebecca-ferguson-says-she-will-play-trump-inauguration-if-she-can-sing-strange-fruit','Rebecca Ferguson says she will play Trump inauguration if she can sing Strange Fruit',217,'us-news'),('books/2017/jan/02/a-life-in-quotes-john-berger','John Berger, one of the most influential writers of his generation, has died at 90. The Booker prize-winning author of titles including Ways of Seeing, G and A Painter of our Time helped transform the way people looked at and perceived art. Here are some of the art critic and novelist’s most memorable quotes. Men look at women. Women watch themselves being looked at.” Every city has a sex and an age which have nothing to do with demography. Rome is feminine. So is Odessa. London is a teenager, an urchin, and in this hasn’t changed since the time of Dickens. Paris, I believe, is a man in his twenties in love with an older woman.” The relation between what we see and what we know is never settled. Each evening we see the sun set. We know that the earth is turning away from it. Yet the knowledge, the explanation, never quite fits the sight.” When we read a story, we inhabit it. The covers of the book are like a roof and four walls. What is to happen next will take place within the four walls of the story. And this is possible because the story’s voice makes everything its own.” What makes photography a strange invention – with unforeseeable consequences – is that its primary raw materials are light and time.” The poverty of our century is unlike that of any other. It is not, as poverty was before, the result of natural scarcity, but of a set of priorities imposed upon the rest of the world by the rich. Consequently, the modern poor are not pitied … but written off as trash. The twentieth-century consumer economy has produced the first culture for which a beggar is a reminder of nothing.” You painted a naked woman because you enjoyed looking at her, put a mirror in her hand and you called the painting Vanity, thus morally condemning the woman whose nakedness you had depicted for you own pleasure.” Hope is not a form of guarantee; it’s a form of energy, and very frequently that energy is strongest in circumstances that are very dark.” To be desired is perhaps the closest anybody in this life can reach to feeling immortal.” The past is the one thing we are not prisoners of. We can do with the past exactly what we wish. What we can’t do is to change its consequences.” “A man’s death makes everything certain about him. Of course, secrets may die with him. And of course, a hundred years later somebody looking through some papers may discover a fact which throws a totally different light on his life and of which all the people who attended his funeral were ignorant. Death changes the facts qualitatively but not quantitatively. One does not know more facts about a man because he is dead. But what one already knows hardens and becomes definite. We cannot hope for ambiguities to be clarified, we cannot hope for further change, we cannot hope for more. We are now the protagonists and we have to make up our minds.”','https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/02/a-life-in-quotes-john-berger','A life in quotes: John Berger',218,'books'),('football/2017/jan/02/arsene-wenger-arsenal-bournemouth-rest-periods','Arsène Wenger has strongly criticised the scheduling of Premier League matches during the Christmas and new year period, describing it as “the most uneven” he has encountered during his 20 years working in this country and claimed it has left Arsenal “with a big handicap” in regards to their title aspirations. The Frenchman’s ire has been raised by his team having to travel to Bournemouth on Tuesday, after facing Crystal Palace at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday. “Honestly I don’t really know if the Premier League masters the fixtures,” Wenger said, adding that “some teams have more luck than others” in regards to when their matches have taken place during this traditionally busy time of the season. Wenger is not the first top-flight manager to criticise the scheduling. Sam Allardyce called for the fixture organiser to be “sacked” for making Palace host Swansea City on Tuesday, with their opponents having 24 hours extra to prepare for the potentially significant match. In October, Jürgen Klopp also expressed his bewilderment at Liverpool having to take on Sunderland some 44 hours after they faced Manchester City in the late kick-off on New Year’s Eve. “In 48 hours we go into a game with a big handicap on the fixture and I have to find fresh legs,” Wenger said before the trip to the Vitality Stadium. “In 20 years it is the most uneven Christmas period I’ve seen. The difference in rest period is unbelievable in terms of all the teams. It’s more we have sold the rights to TV for a lot of money so we have to accept TV chooses the games. But some teams have more luck than others.” Arsenal are having to play three games in nine days because two of those games – against Palace and Bournemouth – have been moved to their respective slots by Sky Sports. Liverpool have also had two of their games during this period – the 4-1 win against Stoke City and the 1-0 victory over City – moved to different time slots by broadcasters, in their case Sky Sports and BT Sport, meaning they have played three times in seven days. Chelsea, the leaders on the back of a record-equalling 13-game winning run, will play three games across 10 days, with only one of their Christmas and new year games – the visit to Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday – moved for live broadcast. With the other two being home fixtures, it means Chelsea have also not had to leave London during this period. Asked if TV companies are affecting the integrity of the Premier League, Wenger said: “We are privileged in our job. We get a lot of money to play football. Sometimes it goes for you and sometimes against you.” It would also be wrong to overly focus on pressure from broadcasters for the scheduling given only one of Southampton’s games across Christmas and new year was shown on TV – the 4-1 defeat against Tottenham last Wednesday – and they have arguably been dealt the roughest hand, having to play three times in six days. One benefit Arsenal have in regards to playing on Tuesday is that they can put pressure on Chelsea by cutting the gap to six points, although Wenger was reluctant to play that up. “I don’t know. At the moment I am focused on the next game,” he said. “We go to a difficult place, Bournemouth. The good news is Jack Wilshere will not play [he is ineligible to face his parent club] but there are still enough good players to give any team problems. “What’s happening in this league is all the big teams win against the smaller teams. Since November it is like that. The only moment where teams drop points is when they play against each other but that can change. “Chelsea wins every single game, they are comfortable in front. We have to hang on and try to win and hope results turn in our favour. We had an exceptional run and in four games we lose two games. I hope it’s out of our system. But every game is so difficult.” Mesut Özil missed Arsenal’s victory against Palace because of illness and Wenger will make a late decision regarding whether or not to select the Germany international for Tuesday’s match. “Mesut is a bit better, he is in bed,” the manager said. “Will he be ready for selection? We will have to wait a bit more.”','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/02/arsene-wenger-arsenal-bournemouth-rest-periods','Arsène Wenger claims fixture schedule has left him with ‘big handicap’',219,'football'),('politics/2017/jan/02/labour-election-jeremy-corbyn-fabian-society','Labour may get as little as 20% of the vote at the next general election and win fewer than 150 seats, according to an analysis of the challenges the party faces. Buffeted by difficulties including plotting a course on Brexit and a continued lack of support in Scotland, as well as Jeremy Corbyn’s unpopularity, Labour has virtually no chance of winning outright in the next election, the Fabian Society report concludes. The thinktank argues Labour should seek ways to win power with the support of parties such as the Liberal Democrats and Scottish National party, arguing this is the only feasible route into government for now. Based on analysis of existing poll data and historical trends, the study predicts that the next election, whether held imminently or in 2020, is very likely to see Labour win fewer than 200 seats for the first time since 1935, possibly falling to about 140. However, it cautions against the idea that Labour could be imminently replaced as the main opposition, saying the electoral system will act as a “firebreak” against a calamitous collapse in the number of seats. The report says Labour’s general election vote over the past 40 years has tended to be almost eight percentage points lower than its poll rating in the second year of the preceding parliament. If this happens in 2020, the Labour vote could fall to 20% or less. But using projections based on recent polls, it says that even if either Ukip or the Lib Dems could tie with Labour on 20%, the electoral system would mean neither would win more than 20 seats, with Labour remaining at 140 to 150. Such a scenario would see the Conservatives win more than 400 seats, giving Theresa May a vast Commons majority. The study – titled Stuck: how Labour is too weak to win and too strong to die – is particularly pertinent for the party as it comes from an officially affiliated organisation, which was one of Labour’s co-founders in 1900 but is now associated with the centre-right of Labour. The report stresses that its gloomy conclusions are based less on the immediate issue of Corbyn’s leadership than on long-term issues such as the impact of Brexit, the collapse of support in Scotland and electoral mathematics. Andrew Harrop, the Fabians’ general secretary, who wrote the report, said Corbyn and his team appeared to have little idea how to respond to such challenges or how to win back the 4 million voters who supported Labour in 2015 but say they would not do so now. After Corbyn triumphed against Owen Smith in a leadership challenge, his team had produced “no roadmap” for overcoming Labour’s plight, Harrop wrote, while the wider parliamentary Labour party had become “barely audible”. “In place of the sound and fury of Jeremy Corbyn’s first 12 months, there is quietude, passivity and resignation,” he said. “And on Brexit, the greatest political question for two generations, the party’s position is muffled and inconsistent. This is the calm of stalemate, of insignificance, even of looming death.” On Monday Len McCluskey, the leader of the Unite union and one of Corbyn’s staunchest supporters, suggested the Labour leader and John McDonnell, his shadow chancellor, would feel obliged to step down if there was no change in opinion polls currently showing Labour lagging behind by about 12 points. Speaking to the Mirror, McCluskey said it was necessary to consider “what happens if we get to 2019 and opinion polls are still awful”. “The truth is everybody would examine that situation, including Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell,” he said, adding: “These two are not egomaniacs. They are not desperate to cling on to power for power’s sake.” However McCluskey later insisted he still supported the Labour leader. The Fabians’ report identifies a coherent response to Brexit as one of the main obstacles facing Labour. Using YouGov data, it calculates that the party has lost a net 400,000 votes since the last election among pro-leave electors, and 100,000 among those who backed remain, making its backing more strongly pro-remain than before. This poses a “Brexit dilemma”, the study says, pointing out that Labour needs to somehow appeal more to leave voters without alienating existing supporters who opposed Brexit. In such a landscape, the report stresses the need for Labour to accept the impossibility of outright victory in the next election and prepare instead for an era of “quasi-federal, multi-party politics”, where it relies on the assistance of other parties. To gain an absolute Commons majority, it calculates, Labour would need to beat the Conservatives by more than 3m votes, a higher margin than in 2001. “Even before Labour’s current problems, this was unlikely,” the study argues. “It is currently unthinkable.” While the proposed shakeup of Commons constituency boundaries would further disadvantage Labour, it is only likely to affect about 10 MPs, the report argues, making this a “sideshow”. Overall, Harrop says this is “not a story of victory or death … but, whenever an election comes, the party must fight for every vote and every seat, because there is a huge difference between winning 150 and 250 MPs.” A spokeswoman for Corbyn said: “Rebuilding Labour support after its fragmentation at the 2015 election was always going to be a challenge. But Labour under Jeremy Corbyn will be taking its case to every part of Britain in the coming months with a radical policy platform, offering the only genuine alternative to a failed parliament political establishment and the fake anti-elitists of the hard right.”','https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/02/labour-election-jeremy-corbyn-fabian-society','Labour could slump to below 150 MPs, Fabian Society warns',220,'politics'),('football/2017/jan/02/manchester-united-everton-morgan-schneiderlin-transfer-west-brom','Manchester United have rejected a bid from Everton to sign Morgan Schneiderlin for around £19m. Everton, whose interest in the France international has been known for several weeks, made their first official move for the midfielder at the start of the transfer window but their offer fell short of United’s valuation. United are believed to be looking to recoup most of the £24m they paid Southampton for Schneiderlin in July 2015 despite his place on the periphery of José Mourinho’s plans at Old Trafford. Schneiderlin has made eight appearances under Mourinho this season – only three in the Premier League – and has been subject of an £18m bid from West Bromwich Albion.

As ever, many thanks for reading. Bye! A bit of housekeeping for you … there were 42 180s which is comfortably a record. These two really have taken darts to the next level. And in a minute or two, Van Gerwen is going to be officially presented with the trophy he’s already hoisted. Twice. First though, Sky Sports reverts to full montage mode. A teary Van Gerwen seizes the trophy again, this time at the instruction of Dave Clark … “That was a bit said to be fair, you always get people like that, they try to be funny. He wanted to give me the trophy but you’re not allowed to do that,” says Van Gerwen of the invader. Anderson is phlegmatic in defeat: “The year that this man has had, it’s been a walk in the park for him. It’s well deserved but I’ve had a good three years, the crowd has been fantastic and we’ve had a good couple of weeks.” Van Gerwen is relishing his moment. In truth he was far too good for Anderson, who really did pay the price for failing to go 3-1 up in sets. The Dutchman’s form when streaking clear of the two-times defending champion was out of this world. A worthy champion indeed. “I feel absolutely over the moon,” says Van Gerwen. “I’m a very happy man at the moment.” Tenth set: Van Gerwen 0-1 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 6-3 in sets): Van Gerwen is back to within one leg again. Oooosh, that’s ominous, a 180 from Van Gerwen but Anderson responds with one of his own! He may need 134 to stay in the match though. He can’t do it so Van Gerwen has 85 for the title, make that bullseye … AND HE NAILS IT! Tenth set: Van Gerwen 2-2 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 6-3 in sets): The crowd are bellowing Anderson’s name. And a timely 140 puts a bit of pressure on Van Gerwen’s throw. As does another 180 for Anderson. Van Gerwen checks out on 100 though – his fifth three-figure finish. Tenth set: Van Gerwen 1-2 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 6-3 in sets): It’s another 180 for Anderson though. And another for Van Gerwen. Woof! Anderson needs 103 to take this leg. Not this time. Van Gerwen needs 124 to move to the brink. But he can’t find it and Anderson takes the leg with tops. Tenth set: Van Gerwen 1-1 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 6-3 in sets): Van Gerwen responds the only way he knows how, with a maximum. Van Gerwen needs 87 for this leg and needs just two darts for an 11-dart leg. Emphatic. Tenth set: Van Gerwen 0-1 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 6-3 in sets): He couldn’t, could he? Anderson has the darts. And he racks up another maximum. Van Gerwen seems rattled by that invader and Anderson is all of a sudden hitting his doubles! Ninth set: Van Gerwen 2-3 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 6-2 in sets): So Van Gerwen has the darts and needs to close out this leg for his second world title. Anderson is going down swinging though with 180 No17. And another! What a champion! Anderson needs 81. And he nails it. THAT IS DARTS AT ITS FINEST! Ninth set: Van Gerwen 2-2 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 6-2 in sets): Anderson has the arrows. And his 16th 180 takes him to 125. He’s left himself 40 but Van Gerwen is nowhere in this leg. Maybe not after a 180. Anderson misses three darts at tops so Van Gerwen has 115 for the title. It’s not going to be this time, and after a brief interlude for a stage invader, we’re back. And Anderson hits double five. Ninth set: Van Gerwen 2-1 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 6-2 in sets): Ooosh. And a 180 from Anderson.But Van Gerwen needs 148. Anderson needs 120. He’s got one shot at tops, but misses. Van Gerwen has double four and takes the leg on double two. Van Gerwen is one leg away now. Ninth set: Van Gerwen 1-1 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 6-2 in sets): Anderson to throw first. He’s left himself 130 and has six darts at it. He’s left himself 40 … and gets it. So we’re level in the set at one apiece. Ninth set: Van Gerwen 1-0 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 6-2 in sets): Van Gerwen has the darts. And van Gerwen opens up with his 16th 18. 100 from Anderson. 44 from Van Gerwen though, and a 180 from Anderson. 51 from Van Gerwen. Chance. Anderson has 140 to finish but can only manage 60. He’ll be back though. 80 then. 20, 20, 20 … so Van Gerwen needs 145. Anderson is back, AGAIN. He needs 20. And doesn’t get it. He’s gone. And Van Gerwen comes back to win the leg with double three. Eighth set: Van Gerwen 3-1 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 5-2 in sets): Van Gerwen starts with 180. Of course he does. And just misses another. The Dutchman is streets ahead in this leg and has six darts at 100. He needs three and he needs just one more set for victory. It’s becoming a procession. Eighth set: Van Gerwen 2-1 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 5-2 in sets): It’s when Anderson is in the 200s that things aren’t really going his way. But he’s left himself with 104. No three figure finish for him yet. Now is a good time to start … nope. He misses double 12. Van Gerwen needs 75 … and he hits double 12. And that’s the story of this match. Eighth set: Van Gerwen 1-1 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 5-2 in sets): Anderson hits his first maximim for a while. And follows up with 140. Van Gerwen needs 76 though and requires just two darts … ruthless. Eighth set: Van Gerwen 0-1 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 5-2 in sets): Anderson with the darts. If there is to be any comeback now is the time to start Gary … 100 to start. Van Gerwen is just relentless at the moment but Anderson has his nose in front in this leg. But visits of 40 and then 45 are not good enough. He’s in trouble again. Van Gerwen has 72 to break again. 16, 16, but he misses tops. Anderson needs 117. Ooouch. He misses tops as well. But Van Gerwen misses three darts at 40 … but Anderson misses three darts at 20!!!!! Van Gerwen needs double one … and misses. Yikes. Anderson finally hits double two to hold. And breathe. An email from Simon McMahon … Anderson on the ropes here. It will take a superhuman effort for him to win from here. He might still be Ali, but it appears he’s facing George Foreman and Larry Holmes now. Seventh set: Van Gerwen 3-0 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 4-2 in sets): The Touré brothers are back. Van Gerwen has 125 for the set. Of course he does. Van Gerwen is threatening to race away with this and burst a number of blood vessels in the process. Seventh set: Van Gerwen 2-0 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 4-2 in sets): Anderson begins with a 180. The commentators are saying there is no ceiling to how good the darts can be … hmmm. Van Gerwen is about to break again though, double 16 again … Yep. The Dutchman has won 10 of the last 11 legs. Seventh set: Van Gerwen 1-0 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 4-2 in sets): Van Gerwen has the bit between the teeth now. He has the darts and requires 47 wih Anderson not on a finish. He can’t do it but he’ll be back. Anderson bounces out. Typical. Van Gerwen hits double 32 at the second attempt. Sixth set: Van Gerwen 3-1 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 3-2 in sets): Van Gerwen is throwing for the set. And piles it on with a 140. Anderson replies in kind. But Van Gerwen has 161 for the set. No dice so Anderson has 124 but it’s just not happening for the champ and Van Gerwen checks out in style on 64. Sixth set: Van Gerwen 2-1 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 3-2 in sets): Van Gerwen hits 180 No2. Anderson does the same. This MC’s “180” is just fantastic. Anderson has 81. Oh, bends the wire but he misses double six. Van Gerwen pinches the leg with double eight. Sixth set: Van Gerwen 1-1 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 3-2 in sets): A timely 140 from Anderson but Van Gerwen responds with a 180 to leave 48. 16, double 16. Simples. Sixth set: Van Gerwen 0-1 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 3-2 in sets): Van Gerwen has won the last five sets – Anderson is clearly rattled but has the darts and must respond. Scrappy start but Van Gerwen has a chance to make it six in a row. Van Gerwen leaves himself 84 and will be back. Hits the treble but misses two darts at double 12. Oosh. That was a vital double tops for Anderson and he’s back in the groove. Fifth set: Van Gerwen 3-0 Anderson (2-2 in sets): Anderson hits 137 after 57 from Van Gerwen. But manages only 60 on his next visit. Another maximum from Van Gerwen, who has 130 for the set. Not this time. 164 for Anderson. 140 but Van Gerwen checks out at 65 and it’s the fifth set in double quick time. Fifth set: Van Gerwen 2-0 Anderson (2-2 in sets): Anderson surely must hold this set to stop Van Gerwen opening up a big lead. Van Gerwen applies pressure with a maximum … 136 for Anderson. Nope. So 94 for Van Gerwen to break. And he’s done it with tops. Fifth set: Van Gerwen 1-0 Anderson (2-2 in sets): Van Gerwen to throw first. How much will Anderson dwell on that missed opportunity? Van Gerwen is bouncing to oche. But that’s a timely maximim for Anderson who has 128 to break. Bullseye for it – nope. Van Gerwen needs 68 to hold, teble 20 but no dice on double four or double two. Anderson needs 35. 15, misses double 10 and misses double five! Van Gerwen nails double one to hold. Fourth set: Van Gerwen 3-2 Anderson (Anderson leads 2-1 in sets): 361 plays 362. Wow. 171 for Anderson just when he needed something. Van Gerwen hits back with 180. Anderson needs 132, not this time. Van Gerwen has 86 to break back. Oh my! He’s done it. And he’s pretty happy about it! Anderson could have opened some daylight there but Van Gerwen loves that kind of finish. Game on. Fourth set: Van Gerwen 2-2 Anderson (Anderson leads 2-1 in sets): Van Gerwen with the darts and he’s left himself 170. This one looks like ANOTHER fifth leg … only 58 for the Dutchman but Anderson is nowhere. 112 for Van Gerwen, nope, it’s now 32. And Anderson is now down to 78. Van Gerwen eventually comes through. Fourth set: Van Gerwen 1-2 Anderson (Anderson leads 2-1 in sets): Anderson is looking good here. 140 leaves him 222, make that 124. What can Van Gerwen do, not much with 95. Anderson needs 124 … but takes 84 with Van Gerwen struggling. Struggling but then nailing a 180. Anderson hits tops though so he leads again. Fourth set: Van Gerwen 1-1 Anderson (Anderson leads 2-1 in sets): A 180 from Van Gerwen, he looks visibly cross, and he should hold this one at least. He’s left himself 40, Anderson is toiling at 249. Van Gerwen nails tops. One apiece. Fourth set: Van Gerwen 0-1 Anderson (Anderson leads 2-1 in sets): Anderson is flying and opens with a 180. Anderson needs 40 for an all important hold but before that Van Gerwen has 170. He hits both trebles … but misses the bull. Anderson hits tops with his second effort so the champ holds. Third set: Van Gerwen 2-3 Anderson (1-1 in sets): Van Gerwen to throw for the set. Both are averaging more than 107 at present. Van Gerwen has 208, Anderson 161. That’s a finish but not any more after a poor first dart. Van Gerwen has 74 for the set … No! He just misses his double and Anderson nails double 12 to pinch the set! Woof! Third set: Van Gerwen 2-2 Anderson (1-1 in sets): Anderson begins with a 180. Van Gerwen with a 177. Then a 174 from the Dutchman. The nine-darter is still on. He needs 150 … Hits the treble 20 but misses the treble 18 and Anderson holds his nerve. Third set: Van Gerwen 2-1 Anderson (1-1 in sets): Anderson is reeling a bit. Not hitting his trebles in this leg. 140. Better from Anderson but Van Gerwen will have 130 to hold. And six darts at it. He’s down to double eight but he’s wide. Van Gerwen is back at 16, then eight, but nails double four with his third dart. Third set: Van Gerwen 1-1 Anderson (1-1 in sets): 83 from Anderson – he’s not starting that well – and Van Gerwen nails a maximum. Almost another but it’s 140 for Van Gerwen. 149, just like that for Van Gerwen, who has three darts at 32 to break back. Second time lucky and we’re back on through. That was some reply. Third set: Van Gerwen 0-1 Anderson (1-1 in sets): Van Gerwen with the arrows – 58 is not a good start. 140 from Anderson and the pressure is on the Dutchman. 59 opens the door for the champ. Anderson has left himself 170 to finish. No dice. Van Gerwen has 110 to save but misses double 16 so Anderson has 52 to steal … and does it. That’s our first break. Both players are averaging 107 after two sets, yet it feels like they haven’t hit top gear yet. That was a huge last dart from Anderson to take the second set. Van Gerwen blew him away with a furious start in the Grand Prix final in October, eventually winning 5-2, and there was a danger the same thing would have happened had Van Gerwen broken to go 2-0 up. Second set: Van Gerwen 2-3 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 1-0 in sets): Anderson opens with 60, not great, but he hits back with a 180. His sixth. A 140 leaves Anderson 121 for the set, but a 180 from Van Gerwen piles on the pressure. Anderson can’t do it so Van Gerwen has 84 for the set, but he slips into the treble nine rather than 14. So Anderson has 80. He doesn’t leave much room for double tops but he squeezes dart No3 in! It’s all square. Second set: Van Gerwen 2-2 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 1-0 in sets): If the crowd are to be believed, the Touré brothers are on the oche. Van Gerwen has left himself 90 and should be fine with Anderson on 141. Bull, misses tops, hits tops. Second set: Van Gerwen 1-2 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 1-0 in sets): Yet another 180 for Anderson, Van Gerwen would have done likewise but for a deflection. Anderson looks certain to hold, down to 62 after nine darts but that’s a costly missed four. Van Gerwen has 146 to pinch it but just misses his second dart so Anderson is relieved to hold. Second set: Van Gerwen 1-1 Anderson (Van Gerwen leads 1-0): Anderson is down to 161 on Van Gerwen’s throw but it’s a tall order. The Dutchman will have to check out on 116 though … Anderson has left himself 40. Van Gerwen nails it! Wow! Second set: Van Gerwen 0-1 Anderson: Anderson throws first, 97 to open up. Woof. Maximum for Van Gerwen but 58 at his next visit. Anderson is under pressure with Van Gerwen down to 124. Single 20, treble 18 but he misses the bull. Anderson needs 105 to hold. One shot at double 14, but he drags it. Ooosh, but Van Gerwen misses his three darts at 25. Anderson has double seven for the leg and he gets it on his third dart. First set: Van Gerwen 3-2 Anderson: 43 for Van Gerwen to start. The door opens for Anderson but he replies with 40. Both darters exchange 140s. Then Van Gerwen nails his second 180. He’s on a finish of 138, he has six darts at it so ends up with 36. Anderson piles on the pressure with another 180 but Van Gerwen nails his double at the first attempt. First blood to the world No1. First set: Van Gerwen 2-2 Anderson: Another maximum for Anderson. He’s got one in every leg so far! Anderson moves to 81 after nine darts. Another 11-dart leg on the cards. Oooh. Needing double four he slips into the single but he’ll be coming back. Double two … double one … got it. First set: Van Gerwen 2-1 Anderson: Van Gerwen begins with his first 180 of the night, and he’s moved to 135. He’ll have three darts at it at least but Anderson is on a finish. Tops for the leg … too low. Anderson needs 164 but misses his treble. Van Gerwen is left on 20, single 10 but double five and it’s on throw. First set: Van Gerwen 1-1 Anderson: Anderson responds with a 140 to open up. Makes that two of them. Anderson is comfortably ahead here, and registers another 180. He’s got plenty of darts at 41 … and he needs two. 11 for Anderson in total there. First set: Van Gerwen 1-0 Anderson: Van Gerwen throws first with a solid 100. 99 from Anderson. Already close. First 180 from Anderson but he can’t check out at 163. So Van Gerwen goes at 122 – and it’s there with the bull. Anderson is out first … the MC is giving it beans. He comes out to House of Pain’s “Jump Around” – of course he does. Van Gerwen swiftly follows, to a few boos, to the riff from Pink Floyd’s “Shine on You Crazy Diamond” and then “Seven Nation Army”. Hmmm. No doubting the crowd are with the Flying Scotsman. Niall, who was in the chair I’m currently occupying 12 months ago, has made his prediction. Thoughts? Wayne Mardle and co are waxing lyrical about Van Gerwen’s performance against Barney last night, and they have every right to. As Mardle points out, Anderson is averaging 104 for the tournament so far, Van Gerwen 106. Both are likely to top that tonight. I will stop embedding tweets soon … but this tickled me. Excitement x 10 … Simon McMahon has this to say … wise words indeed. Evening Gerard. The contest between these two darting heavyweights is like the tungsten version of The Rumble in The Jungle, with MVG as George Foreman, seemingly unbeatable, and The Flying Scotsman as Ali, trying for one last shot at glory. It’s hard to see even the brilliant Anderson beating Mighty Mike, but we all know what happened in Zaire. The heart says Anderson, the head says Van Gerwen. Let’s hope it’s a classic, whoever wins. The Finalé at the Pally? Not long to go now … Sky Sports is in full montage mode. Here’s an update from our man on the ground at Ally Pally. Darts fans live by a different calendar. The new year doesn’t begin until the end of the World Championship. It’s New Year’s Eve at Alexandra Palace, with an atmosphere to match: everybody is high on life, booze (there will be a few existential incidents in offices around England tomorrow), Sweet Caroline by Neil Diamond – and especially the prospect of a World Championship final between Michael van Gerwen and Gary Anderson. Unlike most New Year’s Eves, this surely can’t be an anti-climax. These two usually bring out the best in each other, and a high-speed thriller is on the cards. Even if one player runs away with it, the likelihood is they will have produced a legendary performance to do so. If it’s an anti-climax, I’ll eat my bobble hat. First email of the night award goes to JR in Illinois … Hey Gerard, One very nice thing about darts is that you know no referee is going to ruin the match  MIKE DEAN  This one’s going to be a barn burner and a bean blower. Not long now... No more football references, I promise. Proper sport this … Dogs and darts … what’s not to like? Let’s familiarise ourselves with both finalists’ route to tonight shall we? Michael van Gerwen First Round 3-0 v Kim Viljanen Second Round 4-2 v Cristo Reyes Third Round 4-1 v Darren Webster Quarter-Final 5-1 v Daryl Gurney Semi-Final 6-2 v Raymond van Barneveld Gary Anderson First Round 3-0 v Mark Frost Second Round 4-0 v Andrew Gilding Third Round 4-2 v Benito van de Pas Quarter-Final 5-3 v Dave Chisnall Semi-Final 6-3 v Peter Wright For the anorak’s out there, feast your eyes upon these little beauties. Hello world! 2017 is merely hours old but already we have the first seismic sporting event of the year to feast upon. This one is, put simply, the showdown that we all wanted to see. World No1 against the two-times defending champion, tungsten-wielding titan versus tungsten-wielding titan, irresistible force meets unmovable object. Gary Anderson is on a 17 (SEVENTEEN) match winning streak in the competition but Michael van Gerwen is playing on a higher plane that everyone else, he won 25 tournaments in 2016 and has been the favourite to reclaim the crown he won for the one and only time in 2014, before Anderson’s two titles. Van Gerwen’s Dutch derby with Raymond van Barneveld was an epic semi-final and how much it has taken out of “Mighty Mike” may go a fair old way to deciding who prevails in the first to seven sets encounter. Van Gerwen was the last man to beat Anderson at Alexandra Palace, way back in December 2013, and the Scot is aiming to become only the third player to win three consecutive titles after Eric Bristow and Phil Taylor. It’s going to be tense, it’s likely to be thrilling and there’s a very good chance it’ll be tight. Kick-off is around 8pm and while both men are playing for the pride and the prestige of winning the tournament, they’re also playing for the rather sizeable Sid Waddell Trophy. Here’s a compilation of the late, great Voice of Darts. Gerard will be here shortly.

New South Wales police have alleged that the man assaulted his 71-year-old cell mate about 10.50pm on Monday, causing significant head injuries. In a statement, police said prison guards tried to administer first aid to the man who was then taken in an ambulance to hospital, where he later died. The deceased man is reported to be Frank Townsend. Police have not confirmed reports he was bashed to death with a sandwich press, but did say that “a number of items were seized from the cell”. A spokeswoman for Corrective Services NSW said the incident occurred in the Kevin Waller unit, which caters for aged and frail prisoners Long Bay is a maximum and minimum security prison, catering to both men and women, 14km south-east of the Sydney CBD. The NSW government announced in March that the land would be sold and a new, much larger jail, would be built at Wollondilly, south-west of Sydney. It is just over 12 months since Aboriginal man David Dungay Hill died in custody at Long Bay, after being forcibly removed from his cell in the mental health ward by guards in riot gear.

The soldier, from the 2nd Battalion the Duke of Lancaster’s Regiment, did not die as a result of enemy fire, the MoD said. Its statement said: “The death occurred in Taji, Iraq, following an incident that is currently under investigation, but we can confirm that it was not as a result of enemy activity.” Officials have informed the soldier’s family, who requested a period of grace be given before the name is released. Earlier on Monday, the US-led coalition in Iraq, which is trying to tackle Islamic State announced that a service member had been killed on 2 January. The statement from the Combined Joint Task Force said: “The service member’s name and the circumstances surrounding the death will be released at the discretion of the pertinent national authorities. The incident is under investigation.” Taji is a town close to Baghdad where the British army has a training and advisory operation: Camp Taji is a coalition forces base also known as Camp Cooke.

The finding reshapes one of the most prominent assumptions of the US gun control debate. Just 22% of current gun owners who acquired a firearm within the past two years did so without a background check, according to a new national survey by public health researchers at Harvard and Northeastern universities shared in advance with the Trace and the Guardian. For years, politicians and researchers have estimated that as many as 40% of gun transfers are conducted without a background check – a statistic based on an extrapolation from a 1994 survey. Gun rights activists had decried that estimate as outdated and inaccurate. The new survey, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, found that the current proportion of gun sales conducted without a background check is about half of the figure cited by prominent Democratic gun control advocates, including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. It also found that gun owners in states that require background checks on all private gun sales were much less likely to report acquiring a gun without a background check than those in states with no universal background check law – a potential indication that efforts to boost screenings at the local level are succeeding, even in the absence of federal legislation. The study’s authors hailed the new statistics as good news. “We’ve been moving in the right direction,” said Deborah Azrael, a researcher at the Harvard School of Public Health. Background checks screen for individuals who are not permitted by law to own a gun, including criminals and those who pose a public safety threat. But the expansion of background checks has been a key political battleground in the gun control conversation. Since the 2012 massacre at the Sandy Hook elementary school, Obama and other Democrats have made the case for new gun laws by arguing that as many as 40% of guns in America are sold without a criminal background check – a statistic criticized by gun rights groups. The figure was revived again in the 2016 presidential election. In October 2015, Hillary Clinton earned “three pinocchios” from the Washington Post Fact Checker blog when she said during a campaign rally that “40% of guns are sold at gun shows, online sales”. Azrael hopes the new research can help inform better debate – and policy – concerning background checks. “It’s crazy that nobody has asked these questions since 1994,” Azrael said. “I mean, should we be citing 20-year-old statistics in support of contemporary policy? Probably not, but the problem is that there has been no effort to maintain any kind of ongoing check on what has been happening.” Phil Cook, a prominent gun law researcher, said the new, smaller estimate did not undermine the argument that the US needs a federal law instituting universal background checks on gun sales. In fact, he said, the finding that a smaller number of guns are acquired without background checks could be an advantage for supporters of stricter gun control laws. “The headline is that we as a nation are closer to having 100% of gun transactions with a background check than we might have thought,” says Cook, a gun violence researcher at Duke University who conducted the 1994 survey. “So, it’s more attainable, and cheaper, to pass a universal requirement than it would be if 40% of transactions were still being conducted without these screenings.” The National Rifle Association, which has called the 40% estimate a a “lie”, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the new background check statistic. Donald Trump, a close NRA ally who ran on a pro-gun rights platform, opposes expanding federal background check laws, arguing instead that “we need to fix the system we have”. Gun control advocates say enforcement of the current background checks system is as much a policy goal as expanding background checks. The federal background check system has put a stop to more than 2.4m gun transactions since its implementation in 1994, but checks are not required on sales between private parties, such as many of those made at gun shows and arranged online. “It’s not that the laws are ineffective, it’s that they’re so weak,” said Joseph Vince, a former agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms who currently heads the criminal justice programs at Mount St Mary’s University. “With the legislation currently in place, it’s incredibly difficult for law enforcement to track down guns that emerge from the secondary market.” Over the past two decades, 19 states have moved to regulate private gun transfers, including, as of 1 January, Nevada. While research suggests that background checks can help reduce gun offenses, measuring the full impact is difficult given the myriad factors that can influence crime rates. Some studies also suggest that background checks can disrupt the flow of interstate gun trafficking. The new survey also found that in states that had passed universal screening laws by 1 July 2013, just 26% of gun owners said they had obtained a gun through a private sale without a background check, compared to 57% of purchasers who live in states without such requirements. Overall, researchers found that half of guns transferred privately in all states within the past two years were obtained without a background check. While the share of gun owners who obtain weapons without being screened has shrunk, the updated survey results expose the holes that remain in the background check system. Among owners who purchased their most recent gun from a friend or acquaintance, 77% did so without a background check. If the purchase was made online, roughly 45% of respondents didn’t face screening. “Compared to ’94, there is this shift toward more people getting background checks,” said Matt Miller, a professor of epidemiology at Northeastern and co-director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center. “But we still can’t lose sight of the fact that there are still millions of people every year who are getting guns, often from friends and acquaintances, without them.” The new study also shows that more Americans than ever are buying their firearms as opposed to inheriting or receiving them as gifts. Eighty per cent of gun owners who obtained their most recent firearm within the past two years purchased it, compared to 60% of people who obtained a firearm more than five years ago. The new background check statistics come from the most rigorous survey of American gun ownership in more than a decade – but as with any self-reported survey data it has limitations, including potential bias from respondents’ faulty memories. Because the survey was conducted online, the researchers wrote, the results may be less subject to the bias that affects surveys conducted over the phone, where people may be more likely to give live interviewers the answers they think are more socially acceptable. The researchers asked 1,613 adult gun owners if they had undergone a background check for their most recently acquired firearm. The researchers also asked if the person who sold respondents the gun had asked to see a firearm license or permit before going through with the sale. If the answer to either question was yes, the respondent was listed as having gone through a background check. The team later asked the gun owners when they had acquired their most recent firearm. The 2015 survey found that just 22% of gun owners who had acquired a gun in the previous two years reported doing so without a background check. Gun owners who had acquired a gun earlier than that – between two and five years before 2015, or more than five years before – were more likely to remember doing so without a background check. A full 57% of gun owners who reported acquiring their most recent gun more than five years before 2015 reported getting the gun without a background check. Because the survey relied on the memories of the participants, the researchers wrote, the more recent gun acquisition data might be more accurate. This story was produced in collaboration with the Trace as part of a partnership to report on exclusive new gun ownership data.','https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/02/guns-state-background-checks-study','Just one in five Americans obtains gun without background check, survey finds',225,'us-news'),('tv-and-radio/2017/jan/02/the-halcyon-episode-one-recap-finally-a-period-drama-to-rival-downton-abbey','“You know that sound. We all gotta move out.” Sequins! Satin shoes! Kara Tointon! Big band sound! Red lipstick on cigarettes! Cocktails! Air raid sirens! Americans! Kara Tointon’s buttocks! This was ITV pulling out all the stops to strike costume drama gold. And, dammit, they came pretty close. This opener was enjoyable stuff with proper potential, a hint of raciness – and only a sprinkling of non-sequiturs to spoil it all. Is it just me or was the explosion in the opening unexplained and inconsequential? Perhaps it was meant to illustrate the random cruelty of war. Who can tell? No matter. Mostly this worked. The Halcyon – “the story of a bustling and glamorous hotel” – has already been compared to Downton Abbey, Upstairs Downstairs and Mr Selfridge. But don’t let that put you off. (Only joking, period drama fans.) The opening credits are Bond-esque, suggesting that this is a drama with a Netflix complex, not afraid to underline its contemporary relevance. And we were straight in with mentions of “a plague of itinerants” from a Katie Hopkins character who could have been talking about Syrian refugees. It’s also worth noting tonal similarities to Amazon Prime’s The Collection, set in the 1940s and which prides itself, as The Halcyon surely must, on its gorgeous, glossy costumes. But beautifully shot though this series is, it clearly has bigger, political aspirations: “Churchill is an idiot.” The Halcyon tackled reality within the first five minutes, necessitating a large decanter of neat gin. If Downton Abbey pretended that history barely existed, The Halcyon made a proper attempt to situate the hotel in the thick of real events. This bodes well. Despite being slightly uneven occasionally, this episode showed that this is a series that deserves to be taken seriously. For now. There were moments when it careered towards a dangerous mixture of slow action and a surfeit of characters. But it was easily saved from disaster by some wonderfully intriguing performances from Steven Mackintosh as Machiavellian hotel manager Richard Garland, Charity Wakefield as the blowsy, Nazi-sympathising mistress Charity Lambert (don’t get too obsessed with her, she’s only in one more episode) and a smouldering Olivia Williams as the haughty jilted wife, Lady Priscilla Hamilton. I wondered whether they threw away the hotel’s 50th birthday, especially in an episode that was bookended by parties. But it did manage to balance the right amount of setup and plot, getting rid of the patriarch from the off, having established the brothers at each other’s throats, the widow with a grudge and the girl from below stairs with an eye on the throne: “He’s his Lordship’s heir. And you’re just the girl behind reception.” Of course, this would not be British costume drama without a hint of anachronism – a notorious hallmark of Downton Abbey. I’m not convinced that anyone in 1940 would say: “This policy of appeasement you support ... How is that working for you?” But I was willing to overlook that in view of how sensible most of the dialogue and scenes were, in direct contrast to The Halcyon’s cash-cow predecessor. A costume drama with intelligence, wit and style that actually makes sense? Halcyon days indeed. Diamante brooch for best supporting costume Lady Hamilton had some beautiful numbers and surely wins the consolation prize – the Maggie Smith award for best severe Marcel wave. But Kara Tointon (as singer Betsy Day) has aced wardrobe here and must be awarded this week’s diamante brooch. How many outfit changes in one episode? I counted seven. I do hope Tointon is not going to be used as window-dressing, though, as she deserves better than a naked frolic in his Lordship’s bath and a never-ending parade of bias-cut gowns (however adorable). Inevitable Downton Abbey flashback moment The relationship between Mr Garland and his concierge daughter Emma has the potential to live up to memories of the dynamic between Thomas and O’Brien in series one of Downton Abbey. It was always a major flaw in Downton that that relationship collapsed so quickly and wasn’t allowed to develop. Tonight’s opener set up Garland and Daughter as the backbone for this entire story. Yes, the aristocratic hotel owners will have a lot of say in driving the plot, but we need to care about Mr Garland and Emma most of all. They are the ones really running the show. Show-stopping lines “You can still smell some tart.” Seeing as Charity had downed enough gin to sink a sailor, it would surely take more than a brief visit from housekeeping to disguise her stench? “You seem a man of limited worth.” Wonderful withering touches at every turn from Lady Hamilton. And do I sense some previous between her and Mr Garland? “Are you trying to blackmail me?” “No, I’m trying to impress you ... I do hope we can be friends.” Glorious oiliness from Mr Garland. I have high hopes that he will turn out to be a very nasty piece of work indeed.','https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/02/the-halcyon-episode-one-recap-finally-a-period-drama-to-rival-downton-abbey','The Halcyon episode one recap – finally! A period drama to rival Downton Abbey',226,'tv-and-radio'),('football/blog/2017/jan/02/manchester-united-zlatan-ibrahimovic-tutorial-marcus-rashford-football','Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s contribution was the garnish rather than the main course but compared with the kind of nourishment he had proposed for some onlookers earlier in the week, it still went down rather well. His had been a supporting part in a Manchester United performance that offered little more than fits and spurts before the game-changing introductions of Marcus Rashford and Juan Mata that terminally stretched West Ham United, but the 35-year-old Swede possesses a knack of having the last word at will. His first goal of 2017 showed once more that time’s passage means little when a showman is doing as he always has. It is more of a surprise when Ibrahimovic does not raise the eyebrows but he still wrong-footed a few when, on the eve of this fixture, he announced a gift for malapropism. “Like always, I make them eat their balls” was his verdict on the way in which he has silenced any critics over the past five months and if that brought some rather awkward contortions to mind it was a reminder – were one needed – that the Swede has displayed some remarkable elasticity of his own. Had a typically age-defying star‑jump against Middlesbrough little more than 48 hours previously brought the valid goal it deserved, Ibrahimovic would have equalled Lionel Messi’s 51-goal tally for 2016. It was some year for a man who left Paris as a self-crowned king and is on the way to attaining similar status in Manchester; piece by piece his swaggering efficiency has rubbed off on a team who spent so long looking crushingly prosaic and the return of the “Old United”, of which Usain Bolt chose to broadcast his delight on New Year’s Eve, has been little coincidence. This, then, seemed a fair enough stage upon which Ibrahimovic could begin 2017 – and certainly one of which Bolt would approve. Three points, as opposed to the three gold medals Bolt won here in 2012, would do this time. Visiting players have provided most of the sparkle at this arena since West Ham’s arrival – recall Alexis Sánchez’s coruscating masterclass of early December – and Ibrahimovic’s newly bereft doubters might reasonably have expected their lesson to be hammered home further. It said plenty that, despite the burden of two games within a space of time that will surely draw enough complaints to become a thing of the past before long, Ibrahimovic was not one of the five players changed by José Mourinho here. He had never experienced this kind of schedule before but is simply too important to be rested, too focal to an attack that would look brittle without him. Not that he was at all infallible here. There was little joy to be had early on as United, pushed back by a lively West Ham side, largely left him isolated but that state of affairs quickly changed upon Mike Dean’s bizarre dismissal of Sofiane Feghouli. United’s near-monopoly of possession was inevitable and so, too, was the increased involvement of Ibrahimovic, who became increasingly prominent but had only an awry backheel towards Henrikh Mkhitaryan to show for his early efforts. He was beginning to pull into troublesome areas, though, and it was a low right-sided delivery that set in train a comedy of attacking errors resulting in Antonio Valencia, then Jesse Lingard, somehow failing to beat Darren Randolph. When Ibrahimovic found a more direct threat of his own, pulling away to the left of the defence after beating the offside trap to a ball over the top, the result was even less edifying: a miscued left-foot volley smashed far over the crossbar when, even on his wrong side, a 13th Premier League goal of the season might not have seemed an unreasonable expectation. As United eventually turned the screw it was the injection of speed and verve provided by Rashford – attacking an uneasy right-back, Havard Nordtveit, who looked ripe for exposing as soon as the teams’ shapes became obvious – that altered the dynamic. Ibrahimovic loves helping Rashford develop. “Time by time, he will take over everything,” he said of the 19-year-old in September, and one adept piece of hold-up play and through-ball provided a half-chance to underscore the point. This time the apprentice’s flourish could not match the touch of the sorcerer, Randolph saving at his near post, but the germ of an understanding between players at opposite ends of the career spectrum was at least in evidence. Ibrahimovic promptly gave Rashford an up-close tutorial of how it was done. He was offside when he profited from an eccentric piece of defending from Pedro Obiang and a ricochet off Ander Herrera, but he was the last person to care. Randolph was left standing: 19 Premier League starts, 13 Premier League goals; a statistic as fresh and vital as the man who had created it. Mourinho is no fool: despite current evidence, it would be little short of miraculous if Ibrahimovic did not need some kind of breather over the next five months. Here, on a night when their manager suggested they looked tired and for long periods short of the ingenuity required to break down opponents reduced to 10 men, was at least some suggestion that United have the wherewithal to skin an obdurate cat in different ways. Yet even on a relative off-night, Ibrahimovic showed how quickly he has become indispensable to the current United setup – and how much succour he takes from making others swallow words, predictions, and plenty more&nbsp;besides.','https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/jan/02/manchester-united-zlatan-ibrahimovic-tutorial-marcus-rashford-football','Manchester United’s Zlatan Ibrahimovic gives Marcus Rashford a tutorial | Nick Ames',227,'football'),('football/2017/jan/02/slaven-bilic-rails-against-red-card-west-ham-sofiane-feghouli','Slaven Bilic lamented the early red card shown to Sofiane Feghouli in West Ham’s 2-0 defeat to Manchester United and said that Phil Jones would have been a more suitable target for punishment. Feghouli was dismissed by the referee Mike Dean in the 15th minute after what had seemed a fair challenge with Jones, who won the ball but was caught afterwards by the midfielder’s follow-through. There was no suggestion of malicious intent but Dean chose to take the severest action for a perceived offence that the West Ham manager – an uncomprehending figure on the touchline at the time – did not feel merited even a booking. “I was very surprised,” Bilic said of the decision. “You know me, I’m the first one who says [referees] have a difficult job, and every time we look at a slow motion I go: ‘Yeah, they don’t have that in real time.’ But I said it then – I wouldn’t have been happy with a yellow. I said it to the fourth official and to [José] Mourinho, it’s not a yellow. If it was yellow I’d be asking: ‘Why a yellow so early in the game for basically nothing?’ And you have to know it’s Feghouli – he very rarely makes a foul.” Bilic did not see a replay of the incident until after full-time and suggested that Jones, who appeared to be hurt by the tackle, was deflecting attention from his own misjudgment. “After the game, when I saw it, it gave me proof that I’m right,” Bilic said. “The more times I’ve seen it, it’s the other way round. It was Jones who made a more dangerous tackle than Feghouli, like a scissor. He got the ball, OK, but that was dangerous. Maybe his reaction was to save himself, but definitely not a red card.” The manager confirmed that West Ham will appeal the decision, saying he expected a resolution in his club’s favour and that he would be “gutted” to lose Feghouli for three matches. West Ham had started brightly and, even though they still created chances to take the lead with 10 men, losing a player fundamentally altered their approach. “Of course the decision had an impact, so early,” he said. “I won’t say it killed us because we continued to play well, but it had a major impact on the game that prevented us from hurting them more.” Mourinho preferred to focus on the Premier League’s scheduling. Both sides were playing their second game in a little more than 48 hours and the United manager said that despite their eventual breakthrough, it had been difficult for United to play well. “It was not a very good performance,” he said. “I think it’s very difficult to play football in these circumstances, with 48 hours [between games]. “It’s amazing for fans around the world, where nobody has football, and I’m more than happy to do that, but it’s very hard for the players. When you have one player more, you need to think well. They were too tired to think well, and made lots of wrong decisions. It was only when I got fresh people on, [Juan] Mata and [Marcus] Rashford, that the team was different.”','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/02/slaven-bilic-rails-against-red-card-west-ham-sofiane-feghouli','Slaven Bilic rails against red card for West Ham’s Sofiane Feghouli',228,'football'),('books/2017/jan/02/john-berger-obituary','The art critic, essayist and novelist John Berger threw down his challenge early in his television series Ways of Seeing. This came in 1972, the year when Berger, who has died aged 90, broke through to real fame from his niche celebrity on the arts pages of the New Statesman. Ways of Seeing, made on the cheap for the BBC as four half-hour programmes, was the first series of its kind since Civilisation (1969), 13 one-hour episodes for which Kenneth Clark, its writer and presenter, and a BBC production team had travelled 80,000 miles through 13 countries exploring 2,000 years of the visual culture of the western world. Berger travelled as far as the hut in Ealing, west London where his programmes were filmed, and no farther. What he said in his characteristic tone of sweet reasonableness was: “In his book on the nude, Kenneth Clark says that being naked is simply being without clothes. The nude, according to him, is a form of art. I would put it differently: to be naked is to be oneself; to be nude is to be seen naked by others and yet not recognised for oneself. A nude has to be seen as an object in order to be a nude.” In other words, art is a commodity and a woman in art is an object. No approach to art could have been more different from Clark’s gentlemanly urbanity. These demotic programmes turned Berger into the hero of a generation studying the burgeoning new university courses on European visual culture. The spin-off book was never out of print. Clark, meanwhile, found himself derided as Lord Clark of Civilisation. Ways of Seeing was Berger’s apotheosis as a populariser, but in this year too he won the Booker prize, the James Tait Black Memorial prize and the Guardian Fiction prize with his novel G. In 1967 he had published, with his frequent collaborator the photographer Jean Mohr, A Fortunate Man, a sensitive documentary account of a country doctor on his daily round in Gloucestershire. These three books began to sketch out the areas of Berger’s lifetime enterprise. They were preceded by the publication of The Success and Failure of Picasso (1965) and Art and Revolution: Ernst Neizvestny and the Role of the Artist in the USSR (1969); in one, he made a hopeless mess of Picasso’s later career, though he was not alone in this; in the other, he elevated a brave dissident artist beyond his talents. The success and failure of John Berger was not predictable for a boy born in Stoke Newington, north London, into a prosperous middle-class family, even though his mother, Miriam (nee Branson), had been born in working-class Bermondsey. His father, Stanley Berger, had wanted to be a priest, but while serving on the front in the first world war he lost his faith and won an MC, to which in peacetime he added being appointed OBE for his pioneering work in business cost accounting. He left St Edward’s school, Oxford, at 16 to study at the Central School of Art; his course was interrupted in 1944 when he was called up and posted to a Belfast training depot, where he served as a lance-corporal in the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry. It was his first day-by-day encounter with the working classes and it shaped his politics for life. On demob, Berger continued his education at Chelsea School of Art (1945-47). In 2002 a Barbican Gallery exhibition devoted to the 1950s London art scene included an unremarkable Berger painting of scaffolding on the South Bank site for the Festival of Britain, but when I interviewed Berger for the publication of the stories collected in Pig Earth in 1979 he pointed out on the walls of his mother’s well-appointed flat near Regent’s Park a couple of his paintings of peasants at work, a kind of stylised realism not far from the approach of the Italian realist Renato Guttuso, about whom Berger would later write extensively. The pictures clearly showed that he might have made some kind of a career in painting, though fortune was smiling on him when he chose to write instead. After college he taught drawing at St Mary’s teacher training college at Strawberry Hill, Twickenham, southwest London, continued to paint, and exhibited his work at the Leicester, Redfern and Wildenstein galleries. It was not until a friend invited him to give a series of talks on art for the BBC World Service that he found his feet. In 1952, he showed the scripts for a couple of his broadcasts to TC Worsley, literary editor of the New Statesman, and began a 10-year stretch as a controversial and highly influential art critic for the journal, often singling out for praise an artist nobody else had heard of. This who he? element became a regular feature of his writings, but never seems to have damaged his reputation. His first published collection of essays in 1960 was mostly drawn from his New Statesman reviews. He called it after the artist’s colour option Permanent Red (pun intended: his US publishers pointedly retitled the book Toward Reality: Essays in Seeing). In it, magisterially, he categorised artists under chapter headings such as Artists Defeated by the Difficulties and Artists Who Struggle. The first category included Jackson Pollock – an unconvincing essay in which he could not quite bring himself to write the artist off though he did assign to his work the dreaded description “decorative” – Naum Gabo, Paul Klee, Jean Dubuffet and – which dates the collection – John Bratby. The second, containing implicitly greater artists, included Henry Moore, Ceri Richards, David Bomberg, George Fullard and Friso ten Holt, a Dutchman who remained doggedly obscure despite Berger’s advocacy. An essay in Permanent Red headed Who Is an Artist? imagines the thought processes of an artist lying under a beech tree and assessing shapes, light, space and volume: prefacing all the argumentative pieces about the role of art in society, it briefly indicates why Berger was a successful and popular teacher and how perceptive he could have been as a critic had he not been so prescriptive. Although Berger’s emergence as television’s populist sage in Ways of Seeing was a throwback to the dogmatism of Permanent Red, it was an extraordinary trick to have pulled off. A running theme was that portable oil paintings came at the right time in the growth of capitalism to be used for publicity and propaganda, a use vastly expanded with the invention of photography. The Guardian art critic of the time, Norbert Lynton, wrote bluntly: “I often cannot believe Berger ... it is clear from his writings that he is a sensitive man and in many ways a wise one, and that he is willing to lie about art to make his political points.” “Lie” may be a bit strong, but in his early days Marxist dialectic did force him into uncomfortable contortions. Lynton may, to take one example, have been thinking of what Berger had to say about the analysis of Frans Hals’s two last paintings by the scholar of Netherlands art Seymour Slive. Slive closely shows how the paintings work technically as group portraits of the governors and governesses of the Haarlem almshouses where the impoverished Hals himself received charity; but Berger says of Slive’s analysis, “It’s as though the author wants to mask the images, as though he fears their directness and accessibility.” However prone Slive may be to an art historian’s preference for painterly values over social discourse, his analysis is nevertheless closer to the heart of the matter than Berger’s fanciful account of a kind of class stand-off between the destitute artist and the governors, not least because on another and more likely reading, given Hals’s approach to portraiture even of men and women in their prime, these two groups are painted with compassion but above all with a sharp eye for laying down what was before him. Though Berger never specifically recanted, he did later admit that Ways of Seeing was too rushed and crude, and that he had not allowed for the genius factor. All the same, if urgency and clarity were at this stage Berger’s great virtues as a writer, as a television performer he also brought warmth and an engagingly persuasive personality to bear. It is inevitable that this huge success remains the main element of Berger’s career, but his more impressive work was rooted in his life-changing decision in 1962 to abandon England as his home and settle first in Geneva, and then from 1974 in a remote peasant community at Quincy in the Haute-Savoie. The intellectual climate of England was too unserious for him. Visitors to Berger noticed how the villagers took to him and his family as easily as he had to them. The outcast in his native London had come home. Here Berger’s remote situation allowed him the time and serenity to stitch his writing into a seamless garment fitting to the village life in which he helped whenever extra hands were needed, at harvest time or with animal husbandry. He had already published his first novel, A Painter of Our Time, in 1958. The painter of the title is a Hungarian refugee from fascism who, just as he achieves a great success in London, returns to Budapest to take part in the 1956 uprising against Soviet domination and is not heard of again. This is a satisfying tale of personal and artistic integrity, though the painter has uncannily similar views to the author’s own much bruited opinions on life and art. Berger followed this with two less successful novels, The Foot of Clive (1962) and Corker’s Freedom (1964), before G, with its three prizes in 1972. Guests at the lunch for the Guardian award held their breath: at the Booker award a few days earlier Berger had attacked the sponsors for exploitation of their Caribbean workforce, and announced that he would be giving half the prize to the Black Panthers, the revolutionary movement. The Guardian’s editor, Alastair Hetherington, said in his speech that he would double the prize money (admittedly small to start with) if Berger would give half of it to a constructive cause rather than the obviously destructive Black Panthers. Berger turned away wrath with a smile, and with warmth and grace accepted the Guardian cheque. Yet G is a not just a powerful book, it is powerfully flawed as well. It is an experimental novel at a time when experiment was the norm, influenced by the French nouveau roman. The structure, with its lumpen authorial interpolations, is painting by numbers: here is one of many possible examples from early in the novel when the rich father of the hero is speaking of his journey through the Alps to be reunited with his mistress (whom he addresses as a sparrow): “‘Ah! Laura. To think that I came under those mountains, the tunnel is fifteen kilometres long, fifteen. It is a marvel ... And on this side of the mountain, passeretta mia, you are waiting for me.’ “(The St Gothard tunnel was opened in 1882. Eight hundred men lost their lives in its construction.)” Cervantes had made this sort of writer’s intervention with a better and lighter touch 400 years earlier. Nevertheless, it seemed that Berger had found his vocation as novelist, playwright, screenwriter and (much less known) poet of simplicity and lucidity – enough verse to put together in a Collected Poems (2014). The half of the Booker money that he didn’t give to the Black Panthers he spent on putting together, with Mohr again, a book called A Seventh Man (1975). It was more ambitious than A Fortunate Man, an attempt to describe in verse, fiction, reportage, photographs and readymade images the lives of Europe’s 22 million migrant workers. The modernist method that marred G worked much better in this media montage, and it was received with acclaim. His first peasant work of fiction – or storytelling, as from his adopted peasant way of life he preferred to call it – was Pig Earth, produced in 1979 by Writers and Readers, a publishing co-operative that Berger helped to set up and finance. It was a collection of tales developed from the talk of his fellow villagers, seemingly as close to the lives of these peasants and their animals as their own skins. It concluded with three stories about the murder of Lucie Cabrol and her presence after death in the community. Simon McBurney and Mark Wheatley adapted them into a play, The Three Lives of Lucie Cabrol: when the Complicite company took it to the Shaftesbury theatre, the Guardian critic Michael Billington described the production as “one of the supreme theatrical experiences in all London”. His next two books, Once in Europa (1987) and Lilac and Flag (1990), were each a collection of discrete stories accumulating into a novel, and were brought together with Pig Earth in a trilogy published as Into Their Labours (1992). Three years later he published To the Wedding and gave all his royalties to the London Lighthouse, an organisation supporting the victims of Aids. Though he never admitted it publicly, the writing of this novel was prompted by the death of his daughter-in-law from an Aids-related virus. The book is a remarkable achievement in which the sequences covering many years and several countries mesh effortlessly into a lucid yet almost visionary tale of a young footloose and fancy-free woman, Ninon, who is dying of Aids after a casual sexual encounter on a beach. She later falls in love with a man who, regardless, decides to marry her. The account mixes the method of magic fiction and a Greek chorus – a blind seller of little metal religous votive plaques, tamata, who has the power to zoom in on the lives of the other characters – with lyrical descriptions of Ninon’s fancy-free life and sharp cinematic cuts between brief sequences describing the journey of her mother from Austria and her father (Berger’s motorbike-riding doppelgänger) from France to Ninon’s wedding in the village church of Gorino in the delta of the river Po. With this book Berger arrived at a mastery that he displayed again in Photocopies (1996), a collection of encounters with real and imagined characters, and later books. He continued to write about art, but related it more closely to his personal experience, and though he never ceased to believe in the perfectibility of society, he edged towards an understanding of Marxism as an analytical tool rather than an infallible cure for the ills of the world. His first marriage, to the artist and illustrator Pat Marriott in 1949, ended in divorce. His second marriage, in the mid-1950s, was to the Russian Anya Bostock (nee Anna Sisserman); they split up in 1970s. Soon after he married for a third time, to the American Beverly Bancroft, who worked with the British Library on its acquisition of the Berger archive, now open to the public. Beverly died in 2013. Last year saw the premiere in Berlin of the film The Seasons in Quincy: Four Portraits of John Berger, directed by Tilda Swinton, Colin McCabe, Christopher Roth and Bartek Dziadosz, and the publication of Confabulations, a miscellany of essays and drawings. At the end of his life Berger lived in the Paris suburb of Antony. He is survived by his three children. Katya, a writer, and Jacob, a film director, came from his marriage to Anya. From that to Beverly he had another son, Yves, an artist and writer, who collaborated with him on the book Rondo: Une Élégie pour Beverly (2015). • John Peter Berger, writer and art critic, born 5 November 1926; died 2 January 2017 • This article was amended on 3 January 2017.

They are either lined with clay, and fill with rainwater, or they are hollows in the ground that rely on rising groundwater in the winter. Both provide breeding opportunities for the common frog. The tadpoles have time to mature before some of the ponds dry out in late summer. This ridge is made of mixed clay and sand, the terminal moraine of the last great ice sheet that almost completely covered England 10,000 years ago. Some of the ponds are ancient, made and lined by our ancestors and surviving still, and others have been scooped out by modern machinery to provide drainage. Either way, aside from garden ponds, they are the main breeding ground for the frog, which favours the ones that dry out late in the season. This is probably because there are no fish to eat the tadpoles. In good years they can produce thousands of tiny frogs. But this can be a gamble. Three years ago after a dry winter some seasonal ponds had such a tiny depth of water that the frogspawn was heaped up in the middle and was rescued by wildlife enthusiasts with buckets. The last three months have also been unusually dry and the ground water is a metre below normal, leaving many of these ponds still empty.

Mitch O’Farrell, a city councilman, suggested the ban last month as a way to protect children from “creepy activity”. He cited drug dealing and other “disturbing behavior” in or near playgrounds. The law would bar adults unaccompanied by children from entering the playgrounds which dot parks around the city. The council is due to debate the proposal in coming weeks. Critics have rounded on the idea as a nanny-state affront to single people. “Why should the city assume that every adult without a child is a pedophile?” said a Los Angeles Times editorial. “That makes a childless adult a criminal just for being in a particular public space, which is an overreach that can lead to foolish enforcement – like ticketing people for sitting on a bench eating donuts.” Indignant comments flooded O’Farrell’s Facebook page. “I am a single person, who has often had legitimate reasons to spend time in a children’s playground without a child,” wrote Krystal Rains. “I take offense at the implication that I am a danger to anyone, child or adult when doing so.” “That is ludicrous, I’m a woman over 60 years old and I can’t go to a playground,” said another post, from Cathy Prange. “My best memories are of my children and how much fun we had.” Robert Alvarez said the proposal invented a problem that did not exist. “You can spin it any way you want but you are stigmatizing single people who visit the park as pedophiles. Shame on you.” Many pointed out that adults use playgrounds to exercise. “I have a bad back, and frequently use playground equipment to hang, and stretch out my back. Would you make me a criminal for trying to get some pain relief?” wrote Gary Lynch. “Often, the only place to do [pull-ups] is on a set of ‘monkey bars’ in the children’s area. Not sure why I should be blocked from a public space,” said Izzy Zayas. Some rightwing outlets interpreted the row as evidence of liberal overreach. “Unbelievable,” said RedState.com. “Nanny state gone wild. Los Angeles attempts to ban single adults from parks,” tweeted the libertarian-tinged Young Americans for Liberty. O’Farrell is a Democrat who represents the 13th district, which includes parts of Hollywood, Silver Lake and Echo Park. He did not immediately respond to an interview request on Monday. However, the backlash prompted him to defend the proposal in a Facebook post last week. “I want to reassure you – this is NOT a ban on adults without children from using our parks. This proposal is limited and affects a small area of a park.” The councilman accused media outlets of incorrectly reporting his proposal, which he said emulated similar laws in Santa Monica, New York and Miami Beach. The department of recreation and parks backs the proposal. O’Farrell noted it had generated “robust conversation” and said he was open to “thoughtful concerns”.','https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/02/los-angeles-childless-adults-playground-ban-proposal','Los Angeles playground ban would brand single adults as pedophiles, say critics',231,'us-news'),('science/2017/jan/02/did-you-solve-it-new-year-new-number-new-equation','Earlier today I set the following three puzzles, variations on the same theme: Fill in the equations below using any of the basic mathematical operations, +, –, x, ÷, and as many brackets as you like, so that they make arithmetical sense. 1) 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 = 2017 2) 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 = 2017 3) 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 = 2017 The pleasure of these puzzles is in the elegance of the statement, the simplicity of the tools required and the achievability of a solution.

The Brazilian’s two-footed challenge on Johann Berg Gudmundsson in the 32nd minute was his second red card of the campaign in the Premier League and third in all after one against Borussia Mönchengladbach in the Champions League. With Sergio Agüero also being sent off twice, along with the red cards issued to Claudio Bravo and Nolito, Guardiola faced questions regarding his players’ ability to remain on the field. Yet the Catalan was in no mood to accept he has an issue to address. “We had a lot of disciplinary problems. Now we expect what the FA [Football Association] decide,” he said. Asked if he feels the need to speak with his players, Guardiola said: “Yes, [from] the team with the most ball possession. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We try to play football – don’t forget it, right. My teams always in my career try to play football. I cannot control the other circumstances.” Pressed if Fernandinho needed to be more prudent when tackling, Guardiola said: “You’re the journalist, not me. Ask the referee, not me. It is always our fault, it’s always City’s fault. Yeah, yeah. I saw other games.” The City manager was also unhappy that Ben Mee’s late goal for Burnley was allowed to stand after the goalkeeper Claudio Bravo flapped at a cross and the defender turned the ball home. “All around the world, the Burnley goal on Claudio Bravo is a fault [foul],” he said. “Here, and all around the world, the rules say the goalkeeper in the six-yard box cannot be touched. He goes here and the striker does this. OK, so I have to adapt and I have to understand there are special rules here in England. Now I learn, so now we’re going to play. “I didn’t see it [the Fernandinho challenge]. But I saw the fault for Claudio Bravo, that was definite. “Now we are going to accept the three or four games. But remember it was a fault [for Bravo].”','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/02/pep-guardiola-denies-manchester-city-discipline-problem-after-latest-red-card','Pep Guardiola denies Manchester City discipline problem after latest red card',234,'football'),('world/2017/jan/02/facebook-blocks-nude-neptune-statue-bologna-italy','Facebook is facing renewed criticism after its software appears to have blocked a photograph of a 16th-century statue of Neptune that stands in the Piazza del Nettuno in the Italian city of Bologna, claiming it is “sexually explicit”. Local writer Elisa Barbari had chosen the statue, which shows Neptune naked and holding a trident, to illustrate her Facebook page “Stories, curiosities and views of Bologna.” But the Nettuno picture fell foul of the social media giant’s privacy policies, the Daily Telegraph reported. In a statement, Facebook told the artist: “The use of the image was not approved because it violates Facebook’s guidelines on advertising. It presents an image with content that is explicitly sexual and which shows to an excessive degree the body, concentrating unnecessarily on body parts. “The use of images or video of nude bodies or plunging necklines is not allowed, even if the use is for artistic or educational reasons.” Barbari responded with incredulity, posting on her Facebook page: “Yes to Neptune, no to censorship.” She told the Telegraph: “I wanted to promote my page but it seems that for Facebook the statue is a sexually explicit image that shows off too much flesh. Really, Neptune? This is crazy! “How can a work of art, our very own statue of Neptune, be the object of censorship?” The statue was created in the 1560s by a Flemish sculptor called Jean de Boulogne, nicknamed by the Italians Giambologna, and it has dominated the piazza for approaching 500 years. “Back in the 1950s, during celebrations for schoolchildren graduating, they used to cover up Neptune,” Barbari added. “Maybe Facebook would prefer the statue to be dressed again.” A Facebook spokesperson later said in a statement that the censorship was a mistake. “Our team processes millions of advertising images each week, and in some instances we incorrectly prohibit ads. This image does not violate our ad policies. We apologise for the error and have let the advertiser know we are approving their ad.” Facebook’s overzealous censoring software has brought the social media giant into controversy with increasing frequency, even as it faces intense criticism on another front for doing too little to prevent the spread of “fake news”. Last year, a Norwegian user was directed to remove the 1972 Pulitzer-winning “Terror of War” photograph of a naked girl running from napalm attacks during the Vietnam war from a post about images that changed history. In that case, Facebook also claimed the image broke nudity rules. However, it later reversed its decision and issued an apology, saying the company recognized “the history and global importance of this image”. “Because of its status as an iconic image of historical importance … we have decided to reinstate the image on Facebook where we are aware it has been removed,” the company said. In that case, Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg apologized to Norwegian prime minister Erna Solberg after the company deleted a post by her in which she shared the picture in solidarity with Tom Egeland, a writer who had included the Nick Ut picture as one of seven photographs he said had “changed the history of warfare”. “These are difficult decisions and we don’t always get it right,” Sandberg wrote. “Even with clear standards, screening millions of posts on a case-by-case basis every week is challenging. “Nonetheless, we intend to do better. We are committed to listening to our community and evolving. Thank you for helping us get this right.” In January 2015, the company was accused of censoring photos of Copenhagen’s Little Mermaid statue for allegedly containing “too much bare skin or sexual undertones”. Facebook says it restricts nudity because “some audiences within our global community may be sensitive to this type of content”. Among the content regularly blocked are images of genitals and bare buttocks. Images of female nipples were forbidden unless a woman’s breasts were “actively engaged in breastfeeding” or where the image showed “breasts with post-mastectomy scarring”. But Facebook’s issues with monitoring and removing content posted by its 1.4bn active users look set to continue. In November, it was reported that software developed with Mark Zuckerberg’s support will allow third parties to monitor and suppress the visibility of posts. The social media giant was accused of developing the software as part of its effort to get China to lift its seven-year ban on Facebook, imposed after the Urumqi riots in July 2009 in an effort to stem the flow of information about the unrest. A Facebook spokesperson said: “We have long said that we are interested in China, and are spending time understanding and learning more about the country.” Repeated accusations that Facebook places unnecessarily onerous standards on user content led to a shift in policy last October, when the company said it was introducing editorial standards analogous to those of a newspaper and would no longer censor graphic material that is “newsworthy, significant, or important to the public interest – even if they might otherwise violate our standards”. “Our intent is to allow more images and stories without posing safety risks or showing graphic images to minors and others who do not want to see them,” Facebook executives Joel Kaplan and Justin Osofsky wrote announcing the change.','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/02/facebook-blocks-nude-neptune-statue-bologna-italy','Facebook blocks photo of Neptune statue for being \'explicitly sexual\'',235,'world'),('football/2017/jan/02/jurgen-klopp-frustrated-two-penalties-liverpool','Jürgen Klopp could not hide his frustration as Liverpool spurned a chance to close the gap on Chelsea to three points at the top of the Premier League. Despite twice taking the lead at the Stadium of Light, Klopp’s second-placed side were restricted to a draw thanks to two penalties from Jermain Defoe as David Moyes’s Sunderland collected a potentially precious point in their struggle to avoid relegation. “In this moment it is hard for me to accept but I have to be professional,” said Klopp, who fears Chelsea will extend their five-point advantage at Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday night. “Maybe I do not look like the best loser in the world it but today two penalties against us feels not good.” Not that a man who saw first the impressive Daniel Sturridge and then Sadio Mané put Liverpool in front, contested the legitimacy of those spot‑kicks converted by Defoe. Instead Klopp’s beef was with the decision to award Seb Larsson the free‑kick which prefaced the second penalty, after Defoe had tumbled easily in the face of Lucas and Emre Can’s combined challenge. With Mané subsequently handling Larsson’s free-kick, the stage was set for Defoe’s late equaliser. “I have no idea when a side of mine last conceded two penalties,” lamented Klopp, who had earlier seen Didier Ndong brought down by Ragnar Klavan but believed his own side could have had a penalty following Larsson’s perceived tug on Nathaniel Clyne. “The first one of course you can give it, both players are there. The second was clear handball. Two right decisions. But we all know in a football game a lot of situations like this can happen and the referee doesn’t spot them. Sometimes he can have a good view of it sometimes not. Both decisions are right but it feels bad. It feels so difficult. “We scored the second goal, it felt good, it felt deserved. Then I would say no foul, no free-kick – there was no contact. Then handball, 2-2, I must be honest it doesn’t feel good. Sunderland got a point because of two penalties in a game. It is usually hard to get one. But to get two! The free‑kick, that was harsh and hard to accept but obviously I have to accept. It’s not the worst mistake in the world by the referee [Anthony Taylor] but it’s so hard to accept. Referees have a really hard job – but two penalties. Ah, that’s hard.” If his countenance was softened slightly by the news the ankle injury which caused Sturridge to limp off in the second half does not appear overly serious, Klopp was clearly irked by having to play two games in less than 48 hours as the festive fixture programme reached peak frenzy. “Maybe we can play better football,” he said. “But not with a one-day break. But I have to accept. It’s like the fixtures, I cannot change anything. We have to accept the results of the other teams, there is a long way to go. We have a long trip home. Sorry for my mood.” It seems unlikely he and Moyes shared any new year humour as Sunderland’s manager was still clearly miffed by Klopp having dubbed Sunderland “the most defensive” team he had faced when Liverpool won 2-0 at Anfield in November. “I’m feeling we weren’t too defensive today,” Moyes said. “I thought we did well today. We got at Liverpool, put them under pressure, pressed them. Maybe if I was a German manager you might praise that. If I’d been German you might praise me for doing something different.” Asked if he had any sympathy with Klopp, he demurred. “I think things go against you,” he smiled. “He should see what it’s like at the bottom of the league. I could say we should have had another penalty for handball [against Can].” Moyes singled out the “brilliant” Defoe for praise as well as goalkeeper Vito Mannone who shone in goal following a shaky display in the 4-1 defeat at Burnley on Saturday. Sunderland’s manager indicated he would not be getting any money to spend in the transfer window this month after owner Ellis Short turned a deaf ear to his pleas. “If that changes in January we’ll all get a surprise,” he said. Asked to pick a title winner from Liverpool and Chelsea he sat on the fence. “I couldn’t pick one of them,” he said. “It would be hard for me to pick Liverpool where I’ve come from – but I think they both have a big chance.”','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/02/jurgen-klopp-frustrated-two-penalties-liverpool','Liverpool’s Jürgen Klopp left frustrated by two penalties for Sunderland',236,'football'),('books/2017/jan/02/john-berger-art-critic-and-author-dies-aged-90','John Berger, the Booker-prize-winning novelist and visionary writer who helped transform the way a generation looked at and perceived art, has died aged 90. Berger had a profound effect on how visual art was appreciated with his book Ways of Seeing and the 1972 BBC television series on which it was based. The actor and director Simon McBurney tweeted his reaction to Berger’s death: Berger’s publisher, Verso Books, also tweeted in reaction to his death: Art and the wider world seemed to make more sense after watching Berger on the BBC, with his piercing blue eyes, steady delivery and groovy seventies shirt, eloquently explain perspective or the idealisation of the nude. Susan Sontag once described Berger as peerless in his ability to make “attentiveness to the sensual world” meet “imperatives of conscience”. Jarvis Cocker, to mark a recent book of essays about Berger, said: “There are a few authors that can change the way you look at the world through their writing and John Berger is one of them.” In reaction to the news of his death, artist David Shrigley called Berger “the best ever writer on art”, and author Jeanette Winterson praised him as “an energy source in a depleted world”. Berger lived for many years in a remote farmhouse in the French Alps, to where the British Library’s Jamie Andrews had to travel when the institution acquired Berger’s literary archive in 2009. More recently he lived in Antony, a suburb of Paris. It was from there he gave one of his final interviews with the Observer’s Kate Kellaway, giving his view, among other things, on the bigger picture around the Brexit vote. “It seems to me that we have to return, to recapitulate what globalisation meant, because it meant that capitalism, the world financial organisations, became speculative and ceased to be first and foremost productive, and politicians lost nearly all their power to take political decisions – I mean politicians in the traditional sense. Nations ceased to be what they were before.” Berger was a lifelong Marxist, a vehement critic of capitalism. He began his career as a painter before turning to writing, becoming an art critic for the New Statesman. He published his first novel, A Painter of our Time, in 1958. His picaresque novel G won the Booker prize in 1972. Subsequent winners of the prize are routinely asked what they are going to do with the generous prize money and no-one has been able to better what Berger did. Disdainful of Booker McConnell’s historical association with indentured labour in the Caribbean, he said he would donate half the cash to the British Black Panthers, who were “the black movement with the socialist and revolutionary perspective that I find myself most in agreement with in this country”. He kept the other half to support his work on a study of migrant workers which became the book with photographer Jean Mohr, A Seventh Man. • This article was amended on 3 January 2017. An earlier version said the television series Ways of Seeing was based on John Berger’s book.

Melbourne Victory’s centre forward overtook Archie Thompson’s tally of 90 when he converted a fittingly controversial penalty in the 30th minute of Monday night’s encounter with Newcastle Jets. Since arriving at Brisbane Roar in 2011 Berisha has dominated the A-League. He scored in his second game, bagged the competition’s fastest hat-trick in his fourth, and capped his debut campaign by proving the decisive figure in the most controversial of grand finals. His goalscoring exploits have contributed to three championships, two premierships and an FFA Cup winner’s medal. We can rhapsodise about Berisha’s many virtues as a footballer, but it is his unconcealed willingness to win at all costs that sets him apart. His hunger for the ball, for goals, and for success is insatiable. Simply, winning football matches matters more to him than most people. During the first half of the recent Melbourne derby, Berisha missed a cluster of chances he would have expected to take. He was one finish behind Thompson’s record at the time. “I smashed chairs. The bin. The rubbish bin. Maybe some doors. I really smashed everything to relax a little bit,” Berisha explained afterwards about his state of mind at half-time. “I wanted it too much. I wanted to score too early. I had to smash some stuff inside and then I was fine. It was relieving.” Thirty-three minutes later he tucked away the winner. After which he celebrated like the scorer of the most important goal in football history. Most of the strikes that contributed to that record equalling moment were treated with similar rapture. To supporters of Berisha’s rivals such naked ambition can seem gauche. But it’s a desperation with context. Berisha’s family fled Kosovo for Germany when he was a boy. Their lives in east Berlin were hard but football offered an escape. A child prodigy, by his mid-teens he was playing for money to contribute to his family’s well-being. Every match in his formative years was loaded with meaning and purpose. For as long as he can remember, football has been more than just a game. “The game is my life and I take it so seriously,” he told Guardian Australia in 2013. “Even at 14 I was so serious. I didn’t want to lose any game.” A statement that prefaced an explanation of how, at 17, he fought tooth and nail to secure his first professional contract, fearing failure would see him returned to Kosovo. If Berisha appears to play as though his life depends on it, that’s because at times it has. “You must understand me,” he implored The Australian in 2012, “this is not just a game for me. I did not learn nothing else. I did not finish school. This is my life. I don’t have anything else. I always wanted to be a professional. I am very passionate about what I do. I don’t go into a game saying ‘this is just a game’. This is everything for me because it helps me and my family to try and have a better life than before.” That Berisha and his family have a better life in Australia is the product of a happy accident. Roar assistant Rado Vidosic was in Germany during the 2011 pre-season watching his son Dario train with Arminia Bielefeld. Berisha, a team-mate at the time, caught his eye. He soon became the focal point of one of the great club sides in Australian football history. This is the natural entry point to laud Berisha’s potency; his composure in front of goal or the expert timing of his runs, perhaps. But in breaking Brisbane’s goalscoring records it was his teamwork and defensive play that earned him the most considered praise. The goals were a byproduct of Berisha doing his job. Ange Postecoglou’s method relied on an overwhelming dominance of possession. To achieve this he required a lone striker that could set the defensive tone and force quick turnovers. Berisha was tailor made for such a selfless role. At each opening whistle he would morph into Liam Neeson (with whom he shares more than a passing resemblance) and turn his maniacal focus on regaining possession into a Hollywood hostage situation. He possessed the particular set of skills required for the job and it made him a defender’s nightmare. As Vidosic explained earlier this year: “He loves to press on his own. He likes to press a defence to one side so that the rest of the team can adjust for the second pass which goes into a crowded area. For someone to work so hard for the team like that is priceless.” Watching Berisha in action for Victory remains exhausting. He involves himself in every phase of play, be it hunting down opponents, offering to receive a clearing pass with his back to goal, or finding space between defenders to be in the right place at the right time to put the ball in the back of the net. All the while his facial expressions and body language betraying the wildly vacillating emotions he is unafraid of hiding. These emotions have at times proven destructive. His bare-chested offering outside of Pascal Bosschaart in 2012 went beyond the bounds of acceptable passion and his three red cards during the 2013-14 season remain a league record. But these outbursts are increasingly rare as the wild eyes and bleached fauxhawk give way to a 31-year old at ease with his status and accomplishments. Nonetheless, he remains the player opposition fans love to hate, a status he relishes. As he approaches veteran status Berisha shows no signs of winding down. Never outside the top four goalscorers in a season, he is again leading the race for the golden boot. With only three goals from open play before round 10 there were murmurings his intensity had dropped off and he was on the decline. He responded with a perfect hat-trick, a riposte worthy of the greatest goalscorer the A-League has ever seen.','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/03/record-breaker-besart-berisha-plays-like-his-life-depends-on-it-because-it-does','Record-breaker Besart Berisha plays like his life depends on it, because it does | JP Howcroft',239,'football'),('australia-news/2017/jan/03/cents-and-sensibility-the-cost-and-meaning-of-owning-your-own-home','In China, there is a phenomenon called the dingzihu, or the “nail house”. Dingzihu are real estate hold-outs: homes of people refusing compensation from corporations or mandatory acquisition by the government in order to make way for development. Their houses stand stark amid the mud and rubble of the construction site: isolated by deep trenches; flanked by bitumen and concrete; shadowed by a network of overpasses. A shack stands awkwardly by the entrance to a shiny mall forecourt. A tiny cottage with a vegetable patch blocks the path of traffic on a freeway. In some cases, whole apartment blocks are demolished, save for a single sliver of plaster and brick, ragged walls trailing loose wires. Visually striking and eminently newsworthy, the dingzihu phenomenon has received a significant amount of media coverage in China and around the world. After all, tenacious residents hold out against isolation from amenities, sabotage, harassment, extortion attempts, assaults and enormous political pressure. When, in 2007, a three-year conflict between developers and a woman named Wu Ping in Chongqing made international news, the Chinese government banned local media outlets from reporting on the story. Yet polls of the Chinese public showed overwhelming support for Wu, and bloggers around the country championed the case as an example of ordinary people standing up for their rights against the increasing power of big business. The house was eventually demolished after Wu and the developers finally reached a settlement. Nevertheless, pictures of Wu’s house, perched on a mound of land surrounded by 17-metre deep excavation, are still some of the most recognisable dingzihu images on the internet. Nail houses illuminate the great power divide between rich and poor. They are the literal concrete manifestation of defiance in the name of the personal, of the intimate. Their stubborn presence is a thorn in the side of corporate logic, a middle finger to the dominance of the market over every aspect of our lives. China is not the only place where real estate hold-outs result in strange anomalies in the cityscape. In the US in 2006, Edith Macefield’s Seattle home became famous when she refused a $1m offer for her 108-year-old farmhouse. She died there in 2008, aged 86, the house flanked on three sides by concrete walls that dwarfed her modest home. At Victoria University in Melbourne, where I worked, car parks have slowly swallowed entire blocks of residential properties save for one or two isolated outposts; in one case, a house, a shed and a garden surrounded on three sides by a vast concrete wasteland, divvied up for hire at $10 an hour. Handwritten signs hang on the fence, chastising users for noise, rubbish, graffiti. Part of me can’t imagine who would want to continue to live with such inhospitable surroundings – a sentiment I’m sure developers exploit as often as possible – but another part of me thinks, if this place were the product of my hard labour, if this was where I had made my home, I probably wouldn’t want to leave it either. The idea of home is as nebulous as it is material. It is, on one hand, a physical space with a practical function: a demarcated area, cordoned off from others; a composition of the material possessions a person accumulates throughout their life; a place to cook, clean, care, eat and sleep. At the same time, it is a sensibility, an ideal: a feeling of sanctuary, comfort, belonging, knowledge and familiarity. It is both the product of labour and its opposite; a place of rest and retreat, and a constant project. Home doesn’t have positive connotations for everyone, of course, but the compassionate among us understand that it should: that everyone has the right to feel safe and warm, to take shelter from the weather, to feel we belong, to be surrounded by what and whom we love. This nexus of place and sensibility is more than the sum of its parts. Home, regardless of where we locate it, is fundamentally in dialogue with our sense of identity, with how we orient ourselves in the world. The emotional labour that goes into creating a home is essentially at odds with the market while simultaneously being exploited by it. Because to develop the sensibility, one must first have the place. A sensibility cannot be auctioned off to the highest bidder but a piece of land, a house, an apartment, a tin shed, even a promise – these are things on which you can put a price tag. And what better inducement for people to trade away the product of years of labour than the security of our very sense of self? When we talk about making a home, we talk of putting down roots, a metaphor for permanence, for the best possible situation in which a being may not simply survive but thrive. A seed can travel on the wind for years before it finds ground fertile enough to support its growth and development, and allow it to expand, flower and bear fruit. To uproot oneself is fraught with risk; roots are delicate things, and not everyone copes well with an abrupt change in the fundamental conditions of their existence. It suits developers and property moguls to have a perpetually transient population. It allows them to hike up rents, to sell and resell with increasing profit margins. Rental prices have been going up in Australia for years and the cost of purchasing property has risen sharply in real terms. That political dialogue so often references the “great Australian dream” – that baby-boomer cliche, the fundamentally anglo-capitalist, patriarchal stereotype of the quarter-acre block with its single-story house, a Hills Hoist and a picket fence, inhabited by a heterosexual couple and their three blond children – is a particularly cruel taunt to those of us who can neither see anything of ourselves in such an image nor have the means to make it so even if we wanted to. A friend of mine works in native title, helping Indigenous communities in Queensland – with whom she often has family ties – reclaim some sliver of the land their ancestors knew intimately, cared for and shaped over tens of thousands of years, and violently wrenched from them over the past two and a half centuries. I think of them when I look at those pictures of nail houses: there is a shared sense of defiance, a refusal to countenance the idea that a dollar value could or should be placed on what we call home, and an understanding that places and people interact in ways that transcend the crude mercantile system under which we live. But that crude mercantile system is the precise reason why for many, a permanent home is something perpetually out of reach. In the streets of Melbourne, increasing numbers of homeless people set up camp. Semi-permanent living arrangements involving trolleys, clothes, mattresses, milk crates, boxes and blankets now populate sheltered corners and disused alcoves across the city. Support networks are overwhelmed and yet continually defunded. People sit on public housing waiting lists for anywhere between nine months and 10 years. The house in which I lived until recently (I have moved, on average, once every 18 months since I left my parents’ house) is wearing around the edges. One of the stairs and a number of fixtures are broken. Some of the locks don’t work. The carpet is old and worn. There is water damage in a number of rooms. The walls are so thin I heard every move my neighbours make. (Home, I often think these days, would be the place where I can always find silence.) If the house had been mine – if I didn’t know that I would have likely be gone in a year – I would have fixed it. But to make this place home would be to pour emotional labour into a fantasy. I don’t have children. My debts are not insurmountable. But two-thirds of my income goes on rent and it is a good month when I can save more than $150. If I could, theoretically, put that aside every month, in a couple of decades I might have scraped together enough for a deposit on a very small apartment. But there’s no chance of that when one needs to save for things as simple as a visit to the doctor, or a new coat for winter. The fact that I will probably be the recipient of my parents’ assets after their deaths – a proposition often floated by way of excusing the children of boomers from having a material stake in the discussion of systemic poverty – is neither comforting nor even certain: I am one of five children; my parents may yet live until I am 60; their assets may be diminished by the costs of aged care, or medical bills, or one of the myriad things that can bring the moderately comfortable to heel quickly. Their existence gives me a safety net for now but inheritance is not a solution to a world structured against the interests of the many. And there is no comfort in the prospect of financial security contingent upon profound grief. In particularly unbecoming moments, I find myself looking forward to the property market crash, that great leveller of economic shocks, when the charlatans and financiers – those to whom other people’s lives are as insignificant as pieces on a Monopoly board – finally find themselves on the breadline with the rest of us. Part of me thinks, maybe I’ll be OK. But then I think about the prospect of still packing those damn cardboard boxes every 18 months when I’m 80, of hauling the ephemera of my life around on crooked knees from one cold, shabby apartment to another, of wondering how the hell one can possibly afford to rent on the current aged pension, and I flash between profound depression and righteous, white-hot rage. When the drilling began for the now-shelved East West Link, in which hundreds of homes were compulsorily acquired by the Napthine Coalition government despite widespread public opposition, communities in the affected areas campaigned hard. They leafleted and conducted meetings; they disrupted drilling sites; they chained themselves to machinery; they physically prevented the construction work from being carried out. They were more than simply tenacious owners of dingzihu; they fought for a vision of a better community: one built on sustainability and an intrinsic respect for the places people make their homes. My great aunt Patty lived until she was 93 and was lucky enough to remain in the house she’d made home for more than 40 years. She died surrounded by the things she loved: books, exquisite china objects – tea cups, vases, ornaments – and a garden full of fantastically wild rose bushes, and narcissus that broke through the winter frosts in bursts of colour. Among the things I inherited was a small paper bag of bulbs that she had set aside for the summer. I still carry those bulbs with me from rental to rental, squeezing them into plastic pots and balcony window boxes where I can, and wait for the day when I am lucky enough to have my own patch of earth in which to plant them. • This is an edited extract from the summer issue of Meanjin, out now (RRP $24.99, eBook $9.99)','https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jan/03/cents-and-sensibility-the-cost-and-meaning-of-owning-your-own-home','Cents and sensibility: the cost and meaning of owning your own home | Stephanie Convery',240,'australia-news'),('books/2017/jan/03/the-best-australian-beach-reads-10-sharply-written-page-turners','What makes a good beach read? My main criterion is that the pages must turn quickly, almost as if by magic. Finding out what happens next becomes the most important thing in the world. You don’t just take the book to the beach; you take the book to the dinner table, to bed, on the bus or the boat. In other words, you cannot put it down. A good beach read doesn’t have to be light and frothy – although sometimes that’s just what the doctor ordered when the most complex thing you can handle is applying sunscreen and floating on your back. We’d love to hear about your favourite beach reads by Australian writers. Here are some of ours, based on both their literary merit (just because you’re reading at the beach, doesn’t mean you want to put up with sloppy prose) and page-turning qualities. 1. The Slap by Christos Tsiolkas A word-of-mouth phenomenon on its release in 2008, The Slap has a simple premise: a man at a family barbecue slaps a child who is not his own. The Slap captured the zeitgeist of John Howard’s aspirational Australia and ignited thousands of conversations along the lines of “what would you do?” But it’s also a page-turner – each chapter is told from a different character’s point of view, and the characters are so well-drawn that it’s a wrench to leave their worlds. 2. Joe Cinque’s Consolation by Helen Garner A controversial inclusion: Joe Cinque’s Consolation deals with dark subject matter but it’s a real-life court story, and the unfolding trial provides the narrative drive. In 1997 Anu Singh killed Joe Cinque with a lethal dose of heroin after she laced his coffee with rohypnol. At a dinner party and in law student circles at the Australian National University in in Canberra, a number of her friends and acquaintances had been informed of her intent to kill him. So why did no one try to stop her? Eminently readable, like all the best true crime, the suspense lies in whether or not Singh will be found guilty of Cinque’s murder. 3. The Riders by Tim Winton This 1994 book is a departure for Winton from his usual home turf of beachside Western Australia. Much of the action of The Riders takes place in Ireland and other locations throughout Europe and it is a joy to see him use his vivid powers of description for places outside Australia. In many ways The Riders is a chase novel. The main character, Fred Scully, goes to Shannon airport to collect his wife and six-year-old daughter, Billie, but only Billie gets off the plane. The reader is as clueless as the loved-up, hapless Scully as to the whereabouts of his wife – and so we follow him in his frantic search for her through the Greek isles, Rome, Paris and Amsterdam. It is fast-paced and full of action, with Winton coming close to penning a thriller. 4. Stasiland by Anna Funder These true stories of the people who were caught in the web of secret policing and industrial-strength surveillance in cold war East Germany is a gripping read. The Australian writer Anna Funder was living in Berlin just after the wall fell, and watched history speed along while the stories of those whose lives were affected by the Stasi, the East German secret police, were being forgotten. Including interviews with both the spies and the spied upon, Funder’s gripping account of the era has the descriptive but restrained prose of a novel. 5. A Fraction of the Whole by Steve Toltz Steve Toltz’s 2008 debut novel, A Fraction of the Whole, is a long, engrossing read. It’s a joyful, discursive, funny romp through three generations of one strange family, the Deans. There are lots of laugh-out-loud moments in this book but amid the humour are some acute observations about Australian character and values. Jasper Dean tries to unravel the enigma that is his father, Martin – paranoid, inventive, hilarious and full of life lessons that he regularly imparted to his son. Fixated by his own death, in life Martin embarks on a series of weird and wonderful “immortality projects”, the results of which kept me glued to the page over my summer holiday. Other Guardian Australia writers recommend: 6. The Getting of Wisdom by Henry Handel Richardson It’s an Australian classic but don’t let that put you off. It’s the late 19th century and 12-year-old Laura Tweedle Rambotham leaves her widowed mother, her younger siblings and her country life to attend boarding school in Melbourne. Laura is imaginative, clever and speaks her mind – and finds out that such qualities might be tolerated at home but get her in trouble more often than not in the wealthy and often judgmental company she finds herself keeping in the big city. A gorgeous coming-of-age story that is both charming and deeply moving. Stephanie Convery 7. Butterfly Song by Terri Janke Tarena Shaw is a young Indigenous lawyer facing her final exams at Sydney University. Then her mother sends her a newspaper clipping about a brooch that is up for auction – a family heirloom that disappeared when her grandmother died. Tarena is charged with getting the brooch back and, to prove her family’s ownership, she must go back to Thursday Island, to the home of her grandparents, and dive deep into her family’s memories and their accounts of the pearling days of the Torres Strait. Part redemption narrative, part Indigenous rights parable, Terri Janke’s novel from 2005 might deal with big issues but it’s a story delivered with a light touch and a lot of heart. Stephanie Convery 8. The Broken Shore followed by Truth by Peter Temple Why have one beach read when you can have two? Start with Peter Temple’s brilliant crime novel The Broken Shore, safe in the knowledge that you’ve got its equally wonderful companion novel, Truth, lurking in your beach bag. When you finish the first you can immediately dive into the next. The Broken Shore (winner of multiple international crime writing awards) and Truth (winner of the Miles Franklin) are set in Victoria. Temple follows some crime-writing conventions – yes there are crimes to be solved, yes the plot thickens, yes there are flawed cops with problems of their own – but he folds in so many layers with so much style that genre becomes irrelevant. The joy is in Temple’s writing – so tight and pared back that it almost seems to be in code. His feel for dialogue and rhythm is superb, his control and timing masterful. With these books he has pulled off no mean feat: literary masterpieces that also happen to be page-turners. Lucy Clark 9. The Watch Tower by Elizabeth Harrower This is no page-turner in the action-packed sense. It’s a psychological thriller centred on domestic life in Sydney suburbia in the 1940s, as gripping and terrifying as any horror story. Little by little, sisters Laura and Clare are controlled and humiliated by Felix Shaw – Laura’s husband and one of the great villains in Australian literature – who loathes women while pretending to love them. How do they escape? Can they escape? An astonishing book first published in 1966. It was out of print and all-but-forgotten before Text Publishing reissued it in 2012. Gay Alcorn 10. Missus by Ruth Park A prequel Ruth Park wrote 40 years after the two other books in her Harp in the South trilogy, Missus is the tale of how Hughie and Mumma Darcy got together in outback New South Wales in the years leading up to the Great Depression – before they moved to the slums of Sydney’s Surry Hills. It’s a rollicking read, simply and vividly written (sample sentence: “The wife never saw John come through the back gate without a wickedly warm tickle in her vitals, and the sight of Eny waggling her bottom as she stirred a pot on the fire made John feel quite astray”). There isn’t a lot of plot but it’s a spirited romp, and Park’s large cast of characters leap off the page.

Asked afterwards about decisions going his team’s way, José Mourinho offered a playful show of innocence, agreeing that his own decision to rejig his team’s attacking personnel had made the difference. This was only half the story. The real turning point here was a Mike Dean joint, the Premier League’s most theatrically exhibitionist referee choosing to send off Sofiane Feghouli with 15 minutes gone after a challenge with Phil Jones that saw both men tackle strongly for a loose ball. With the match scoreless at half‑time, Mourinho took his own moment to intervene, demonstrating the muscle in this United squad by bringing on Juan Mata and then after nearly an hour Marcus Rashford, who combined for the opening goal. Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s second near the end, lashed in coming back from an offside position, continued his own sublime run of form, a 12th goal in 12 games that will no doubt once again have his critics, such as they are, eating their balls. Slaven Bilic felt hard done by at the final whistle after a disciplined West Ham rearguard. But despite some obvious fatigue at the tail end of the festive thrash, United still looked like a team gathering momentum. Victory in a bitty game, 48 hours after their previous win against Middlesbrough, leaves them in sixth and playing here with a sense of strength in reserve. There was a stodginess to the early exchanges on a chilly night in east London. West Ham brought the first waves of noise rolling around this vast, open, egg‑shaped bowl, Feghouli and Dimitri Payet putting Manuel Lanzini in space for a low shot that David de&nbsp;Gea plunged to palm wide. With 15 minutes gone the key moment in the match arrived. Michail Antonio chested the ball back towards Feghouli, who stretched to reach the ball, as did Jones. No studs were raised. It looked like a hard but fair challenge, although Jones came off worse. The referee took his time and then flourished – the word is apt – a straight red card. It was a poor decision in many ways, a needless intervention that skewed the entire night for players, TV viewers and the near 57,000 people inside the stadium. As mistakes go it was at least on a fittingly Olympian scale, in keeping with the hauteur of a referee whose sweeping gestures suggest each match he attends is a spectacle made up of three interlocking forces, Team A, Team B and Mike D. The flow of possession switched immediately. Michael Carrick began to tick in midfield as West Ham fell back into a hard-pressing 4-3-2 shape. Mourinho had made five changes to his starting XI, with Anthony Martial replaced by Jesse Lingard. In theory the front line retained its balance of speed and mobility either side of Ibrahimovic but on this wide pitch and against a team down to 10, Martial’s absence seemed significant. Havard Nordtveit was a fill-in at right back but United barely troubled him in the first&nbsp;half. They should still have scored with 34 minutes gone. Ibrahimovic played a crossfield pass to Henrikh Mkhitaryan. He found Antonio Valencia in the middle. His weak, scuffed shot was straight at Darren Randolph, who scooped it away on the line. The ball trickled to Lingard, who somehow managed to hit the post. On the touchline Mourinho whirled around in search of someone to share his disgust with before spotting the rest of his dugout 50 metres behind him in one of the bubbles of empty space left by jamming a football pitch into this borrowed stadium. West Ham had their moments, Lanzini’s curling shot drawing another clawing save from De Gea. Half-time arrived accompanied by a chorus of Dean-related boos, only partly drowned out by a blast of jarring and irrelevant music from the deafening stadium PA. At which point Mourinho made the change that would prove decisive, bringing Carrick back into defence and sending on Mata to lurk usefully just behind Ibrahimovic. For a while things continued to almost happen. Cheikhou Kouyaté escaped without a card after a horrible tackle on Mkhitaryan. Antonio almost got his head to Payet’s free-kick. With United dominant but lacking punch, Mourinho brought on Rashford for Lingaard to test that right side with some thrust coming in from the touchline. The home team still fought gamely, Lanzini skittering forward to put Antonio in on goal with a lovely little through pass. De&nbsp;Gea saved with his legs, but Antonio had time and space to find a corner. He really should have scored. West Ham were punished two minutes later with a goal made and scored by Mourinho’s two substitutes. Rashford ran at Nordtveit, beat him twice and laid back a neat pass for Mata. His finish was instant, drawing a roar of pent-up relief from the away supporters. United were cruising now as West Ham’s energy levels sagged. Paul Pogba picked up a loose Payet pass and shot just wide. Andy Carroll entered finally to test United’s own rejigged back line. They held on and with 78 minutes gone Ibrahimovic spanked in the second. He was offside. Pogba was also offside and arguably obstructing the defence. It was a goal that summed up both West Ham’s night and United’s own sense of gathering conviction.','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/02/west-ham-united-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report','Zlatan Ibrahimovic on target as Manchester United beat West Ham',242,'football'),('commentisfree/2017/jan/02/the-guardian-view-on-the-arab-spring-it-could-happen-again','This month marks six years since the beginning of the Arab spring, a series of events that were meant to be a major turning point in the modern Middle East. It was the self-immolation of a Tunisian street vendor and his death on 4 January that initiated a revolutionary year. The subsequent protests energised ordinary Arabs, who recovered, it seemed, a popular self-confidence diminished by six decades of autocracy. The Arab street was honoured for its people’s courage and determination, inspiring movements across the world. Protesters did not just voice their complaints, it was said, they changed the world. Four Arab leaders fell. Yet six short years on those dreams are now in tatters. In Egypt, the most populous Arab nation, a counter-revolution has returned a military dictatorship. Much of Libya and Yemen is reduced to rubble in a war where outside powers are the principal actors, prepared to fight until the last local is dead. Syria is in ruins, stained by rivers of blood. The sole democratic success was Tunisia, which did see a peaceful transition from authoritarian rule to elective government. The main Islamist party won power and last year declared it would end all of its cultural and religious activities to focus only on politics – becoming a Muslim democratic party, rather like its western Christian counterparts. But every silver lining has a cloud: Tunisians make up the largest number of foreign fighters in the ranks of Islamic State. The underlying reasons for revolt have not gone away. In many ways the conditions today are even more explosive than in 2011. The Arab state is in crisis almost everywhere: plunging oil prices have holed Saudi’s economy; Egypt’s flawed leadership has created crisis after crisis. The desperate men and women leaving for Europe want a better life than that found at home. According to the UN’s Arab Development Report – the first since the Arab spring erupted – the Middle East is home to only 5% of the world’s population, but accounts for 45% of the world’s terrorism, 68% of its battle-related deaths and 58% of its refugees. This at a time, the UN warns, when the population of young Arabs exceeds 100 million and is growing fast – but not as fast as rates of unemployment, poverty and marginalisation. The rise of the largest, best-educated and most highly urbanised generation of young people in the region’s history – far more pious than their peers in other parts of the world – looks like a destabilising force. The response in the region has been a crackdown: crushing dissent, but not addresssing the reasons why it exists. Small wonder the UN warns of an “accumulation of demands and their re-emergence more violently”. The reasons for another cycle of protest are obvious. The Arab world bristles with swords not ploughs, spending $75bn a year on arms in the past quarter of a century. A hereditary elite hoards power. Business is undergirded by “wasta”, the Arabic for connections. Corruption has resulted in the waste of vast resources: the UN says about $1tn has been pilfered over half a century. This could have been invested in creating jobs and improving basic services. The thinking that shuts out challengers to the status quo needs to be dispensed with. In politics the dangers are clear. If there are no mechanisms for participation and accountability which allow for peaceful protest, then the disgruntled may explore direct, violent actions. In the Arab world this requires an insight into political Islam. The Sunni world is dealing with a psychology of anxiety. A people sharing a rich cultural, religious and linguistic heritage, the Arab world’s largest ethnic group has seen its great cities fall to rivals: Mosul, Aleppo, Jerusalem, Baghdad and Damascus. In the geopolitics, recent events have exposed how Arabs have once again become pawns on the chess board. The landmark resolution at the UN demanding a halt to all Israeli settlement in the occupied territories was not presented by an Arab nation. In Syria, a peace plan was delivered not by a Sunni Arab power, but by Russia, Iran and Turkey. The arrival of Donald Trump in the White House will allow Arab despondency to be dismissed. Theresa May’s ill-judged jab at US Secretary of State John Kerry for a speech criticising Israel was a move in this direction. Mrs May, who refused to follow the Obama administration in blocking arms exports to Saudi Arabia after civilans were bombed, is more interested in defence sales than the well-springs of democracy in the Arab world. This is a mistake: those cut off from changing their own societies by democratic means may turn their anger inwards – or outwards.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/02/the-guardian-view-on-the-arab-spring-it-could-happen-again','The Guardian view on the Arab spring: it could happen again | Editorial',243,'commentisfree'),('football/live/2017/jan/02/west-ham-united-v-manchester-united-premier-league-live','Well, what an odd game. Mike Dean’s harsh sending off of Feghouli in the first half should have given Manchester United the impetus to race away with the game. But that didn’t happen. It took the introduction of Rashford and Mata to swing the game their way in the second half. West Ham can feel hard done by but it may be that Manchester United would have impressed 11 on 11 in the second half with Rashford up against Nordtveit. He absolutely took him to the cleaners. Oh, and one last thing having looked at the tackle from Feghouli on Jones again, you could argue both players could have been sent off. You could say it was a late tackle v excessive force. But anyway, Manchester United have the Champions League places in sight … and momentum. Look out! 90+2 min: Man Utd will go within a point of fourth place in a minute. Six league wins on the bounce eh? That is momentum, all right. 90 min: Nordtveit, who has barely got close to Rashford this second half, dangles a leg out at the Man Utd winger and catches his heel. It’s a sore one and for that Nordtveit is given a deserved yellow card. 88 min: Lanzini is off and Ayew is on for West Ham. Lanzini was bright in spells. His shot in the first half was very close to giving his side a 1-0 lead. 87 min: “Is Antonio Valencia the longest serving stopgap in Premier League history?” asks Matthew Pearson. “It’s a pretty prominent position, the right back for Man Utd, and he’s been there for ages. Moses and Milner have been pretty glorious examples of players moving further back and still influencing business at both ends. Valencia could light up a right wing elsewhere in the league.” It’s an interesting one. I can’t think of anyone else that has been shifted out of position and lasted so long. But isn’t he now just being considered a right-back? And are you only ever a stopgap when you shift backwards rather than forwards ala Paul Warhurst back in the day for Sheffield Wednesday? 86 min: Cresswell is crowded out on the left wing. Manchester United regain possession and Carrick orchestrates another spell of lengthy possession that will help see the game out. 83 min: Rashford, again, shows great composure after a burst down the left to hook the ball to the far post where Herrera volleys straight at Randolph, who deflects the ball out for a corner. The corner comes to nothing. I know he only came on in the second half but I’d give Rashford the man of the match award. 81 min: Nicholas offers some Mike Dean balance. “I might be a rare specie but I think Dean can justify that red card. Reckless tackle, feet off the ground, made contact and all for what might have been a goal kick to Utd.” Meanwhile, Fernandes is on for West Ham. Kouyate is off. 79 min: That Zlatan goal was reminiscent of a killer forehand after a ball is called out in tennis. The kind that is hit with the wild abandon that comes with knowing what you are about to do won’t count. Only that one did. That’s game over but Ibrahimovic is offside. The ball lands at the Swede’s feet after Herrera nicked the ball through to him with a bit of high-pressing. Zlatan is standing almost a foot off but with his back to goal he turns and slams home from 12 yards and immediately looks sheepishly over at the linesman. Ah well. Some go for you some go against you. He won’t care. Eat your own balls. That’s 18 for the season. 74 min: Rashford pulls the ball back to Pogba on the left. Pogba shapes to roll it into the corner. It looks to be heading there but somehow deviates from its line a few yards from goal and slides the wrong side of the far post. 72 min: Cresswell goes scuttling down the inside-left channel after a promising West Ham attack but, at the vital moment, he loses his footing in the area and the ball goes rolling away for a goal-kick. It’s the return of the London Stadium curse. 70 min: “Mike Dean is out of control and incompetent,” writes JR in Illinois. “That is a very bad combination, as the United States is about to discover. I wish somebody could do something about it but it doesn’t look like happening.” He’s not incompetent (Dean that is). But he does like the sound of his own whistle and the glare of the spotlight a little more than a referee should. As for Trump, I’m not going there. 68 min: Carroll gallops on, all beard and hair, having replaced Payet, who must be goosed given that he is perhaps the best-placed West Ham player to find Carroll’s head with a set-piece delivery. 67 min: Herrera finds Pogba after cutting in from the right. Pogba strides away from his marker and tries to pass the ball into the bottom-left corner but his attempt misses by a couple of inches. He had Randolph worried there. He was at full stretch. 65 min: Mourinho makes an immediate change. Carrick moves back into midfield as Mkhitaryan is replaced by Smalling, who goes to centre-back. 64 min: It was a goal made by Mourinho really. Carrick, having been shifted to centre back, found one substitute, who found another. Do you remember when people were saying Mourinho had forgotten how to manage? And West Ham pay the price. Carrick curls a ball out to Rashford on the left wing. The youngster speeds away to the touchline and shows great composure to cut inside instead of crossing (sitting two West Ham players down) before pulling the ball back to Mata, just outside the six-yard box, who sweeps home with his left foot. 59 min: Mkhitaryan and Mata try and fail to combine in midfield and then Rojo plays an awful pass across the backline that allows West Ham to pick off possession. Payet slides in Antonio behind Carrick and Jones, who play a dreadful offside trap. Antonio is one on one with De Gea. He shapes to curl around the Spaniard but he’s too square and sidefoots his shot from 16 yards into the goalkeeper’s midriff. What a chance! Bilic leaps up in despair on the sidelines. 57 min: Rashford is on and Lingard is off. Will the precocity of youth give this game the jolt it needs? 55 min: Well, Mourinho hasn’t got the response he wanted at all. If anything West Ham are pressing higher up the field at the moment. A tactic that will be their undoing if they don’t rein it in. 54 min: “I’d like to see Mike Dean referee a battle between all the different houses in Game of Thrones,” writes Chris Gardiner. “Early red for Jamie Lassiter and John Snow. Show them who’s the real hero.” Readers? I’ve never really got into it. Westworld’s my box-set companion at the moment. 52 min: Antonio heads wide after a West Ham free-kick on the right that is curled, deliciously, into the back post by Payet. It’s the kind of chance he usually gobbles up. The look of disbelief on his face as he walks away tells you how disappointed he is that he didn’t connect with it properly. 49 min: Kouyate fells Mkhitaryan with a dire challenge. It was a clumsy tackle from the side in which his right leg went over the ball and brought the Man Utd player down. Mkhitaryan is lucky that the tackle is in front of him and the full force doesn’t impact on the side of his leg. It’s a clear yellow card, maybe even a red. Does Mike Dean book him? Of course he doesn’t. 47 min: Nordveit plays a short back pass that Ibrahimovic may have got to about 10 years ago. But, at 35 years of age and despite his healthy lifestyle and boundless self-belief, his legs don’t move quite the way they used to and Randolph shows great alertness to slide in to clear the danger. 46 min: Lingard fouls Cresswell after an opening minute of the second half in which it is clear that Mourinho has given his Man Utd players a verbal rocket. They’re scuttling around with much more urgency. 45 min: It’s the second half! Darmian has been replaced by Mata. Carrick goes to centre back and Rojo goes to left back for Man Utd. Will Mata find a hole in the West Ham defensive ranks? So, surely Martial will emerge for Manchester United at some stage in the second half. They need an injection of pace and Mourinho made a point of getting his subs warmed up before the first half had finished. As for West Ham, Obiang has marshalled the backline quite superbly. It would be some feat if they can hold out for almost 80 minutes with 10 men. And, I have MBMed almost 145 minutes of football today without seeing a single goal. I haven’t got much in the way of nice things to say about 2017 so far. I would whole-heartedly lend my backing to this: I would quite like to see Dean sniff the cordite in the air and give this atmosphere a dismissive look. A half in which Mike Dean is the chief protagonist is never a good thing. Manchester United have done nothing with their man advantage while West Ham have probably created more half-chances. That said, Man Utd should be 1-0 up. How Valencia and Lingard both failed to score from about three yards out will remain a mystery for years to come. 45+2 min: The ball is curled in with pace and West ham players call for a handball as the ball squirts out of a group of players. Mike Dean blows his whistle but it’s for half-time. 45 min: Mourinho has buggered off down the tunnel two minutes early. Maybe he’s hoping to locate Fergie’s hairdryer in the kit back and see if it still works. Jones has just shoved Antonio on the touchline and given Payet a great angle to whip a ball in. 44 min: Lanzini picks the ball up on the edge of the area. He throws his shoulder and cuts back on to his right foot and curls a wicked shot towards the top-right corner that De Gea does ever so well to claw away for a corner. The crowd roar and Bilic asks for more noise. Meanwhile, Mourinho has sent all his subs out to warm up. He’s not happy with this from Man Utd. They’ve looked half asleep. 42 min: Darmian’s hip sends Antonio flying into the air. Darmian is booked. It probably didn’t warrant a booking but … Mike Dean. 40 min: Nordveit has caught Mkhitaryan with a late tackle over by the touchline. Dean should book Nordveit but he doesn’t. Funny that. 39 min: Ibrahimovic slams a shot way over the bar after beating West Ham’s offside trap. 35 min: Wow! Just wow! What a save! What a miss! After United switch the play left and right Mkhitaryan drills a ball across goal that Valencia somehow hits straight at Randolph when the goal was gaping. The ball spills out to Lingard, who only has to tap home, but instead he somehow finds the left-hand post before the ball rolls back to Randolph. Fantastic save from Randolph, mind, but bloody hell. 32 min: West Ham have looked the most potent force on the rare occasions they have attacked. They’re not committing too many men forwards but with Antonio’s strength and energy they always have an outlet. Nordtveit stretches his legs up the right wing, but his cross is mishit and goes out for a goal-kick. The West Ham fans are revelling in this adversity and making a rare old din. 29 min: Mike Dean gives Payet one of those withering and over-the-top Mike Dean looks for something that the Frenchman said to him. Yellow card for Payet. “I noticed that when Mike Dean came out for the start of the match he looked to be somewhat fazed and perturbed by the bubbles from the West Ham bubble machine and has been unable to get it out of his system,” writes Mark Judd. “It might account for his performance.” 27 min: Pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass, pass. Not many of those Man Utd passes have been forwards, though. It’s all very comfortable for West Ham. 25 min: West Ham’s response to going a man down has been pretty impressive so far. They have been incredibly compact and are pressing diligently whenever Man Utd advance into the final third. 24 min: Barney Ronay on another London Stadium spotlight-hogger. 21 min: Ibrahimovic plays a backheeled pass through to the onrushing Mkhitaryan in the penalty area but the Armenian can’t bring the ball under his spell and West Ham clear. Jones’s every touch is being booed by the way. If anything, he almost injured himself by being a little too committed in that challenge with Feghouli. 20 min: “Well predicted, Gregg,” writes Thabo Mokaleng. “You said Bilic wore the look of a man receiving grim news. Duly delivered?” Man Utd are hogging the ball but, so far, doing little with it. The pressure will only build now, mind. 18 min: Herrera plays a cross in towards the back post that Randolph does well to paw away. A moment later a similar cross comes in but this time the West Ham keeper holds on to the ball. 15 min: If anything, Feghouli was punished for a poor first touch there. He could have hurt Jones if he’d gone in with force but he didn’t. Jones’s tackle was much more forceful – and fair. Mind you, my first reaction was to wince as I saw the players collide. Perhaps that’s how Dean saw it. 13 min: This looks to be a poor decision from Mike Dean. Antonio heads the ball down to Feghouli, whose first touch is poor. He stretches to win the ball and Jones gets there with a slide tackle before him. Feghouli isn’t going in with force but catches Jones late in the thigh. I think everyone is surprised by that. 12 min: There he is. He plucks a ball from the air and connects play very nicely. I suppose I should eat my own balls now. 10 min: I haven’t seen Ibrahimovic yet. I think he’s on the pitch. 9 min: Lanzini forces a fingertip save from De Gea, down to his left, after a lovely bit of buildup play resulted in two Man Utd players racing towards Payet and leaving Lanzini free on the edge of the box. The West Ham midfielder’s shot is struck well but was always saveable. The resulting corner comes to nothing. 7 min: Payet has another shot at goal after dancing around Jones on the edge of the box but finding a collection of Man Utd players in his way. His effort is dragged once again, mind,and loses pace over to the left somewhere. West Ham have been bright so far. 6 min: Lanzini shows lovely feet in midfield to spin away from his marker and find Cresswell on the left wing but Valencia, who is an incredibly strong specimen, holds off the full-back with ease and lets the ball roll out for a goal-kick. 5 min: Payet has a pop at goal from 30 yards. It goes wide by about the same distance. 3 min: Bilic always holds the look of a man who has just been given some particularly grim news,.Already he has his hands in his pockets and a troubled look on his face. His team have finally got on the ball and are looking to advance down the left wing so there really is no need for him to look quite so perturbed. 2 min: Man Utd quickly take control of the game, with Carrick getting on the ball early to try to dictate the tempo with some short, sharp passes. 1 min: We’re off. West Ham, shooting from left to right on my screen and wearing their usual claret and blue, get the game under way. Man Utd, in white, are going the other way. Antonio is playing as a lone striker today. If the ball touches his head he invariably scores a goal. So Man Utd need to watch him. There are bubbles everywhere at the London Stadium so that can only mean one thing: the players are on the pitch. Here’s Payet showing in the warmup why my theory about taking the wall away might not actually be the best way to combat his free-kicks. An email! “I am in full agreement with the idea of resting Martial,” writes Samyobrata Mukherjee. “Though I would have liked to see Mata and Rashford start this game in place of Lingard and Carrick. Herrera did a decent enough job as the screening midfielder last time out and giving Carrick a little more rest before the cup games and Liverpool at home wouldn’t be a terrible idea. On a completely different note, I’d be much obliged if you tried enquiring whether anyone has an inkling as to why United want to keep Fellaini and sell Schneiderlin when playing a settled 4-1-4-1?” Some words from the managers … Slaven Bilic: “[I chose my team] based on the feeling. And we got three new players in because of the really tight schedule. So we have a good team. [Mark Noble] is our skipper and he’ll be missed. He had a hard knock but he is on the bench.” José Mourinho on whether he chose his teams for the festive fixtures well in advance or just did it from game to game: “A bit of both. But I thought against Boro it was important to have Smalling fresh for this game. Some players react better than others with the accumulation of matches. But, we have no excuses – we have the same problem as West Ham. We are the privileged ones with more time to rest so may the best team win.” Oh, and Manchester United can go to within a point of the top four if they win this evening. Oh, and here are the full-time results from the 3pm kick-offs in the Premier League today: Sunderland 2-2 Liverpool, Man City 2-1 Burnley, Everton 3-0 Southampton, West Brom 3-1 Hull City. Mourinho seems to be taking a lot of heat for putting Martial back on the bench after his impressive display against Middlesbrough. Is that fair? Isn’t that exactly what Ferguson used to do to keep young players champing at the bit or is Martial too important to mess around with his ego? Some classic West Ham United v Manchester United games from days gone by: Burnley have pulled one back at Manchester City. It’s 2-1 now. Both of these teams wouldn’t mind a draw at the Etihad. Burnley are one place above West Ham, City were a place above Manchester United before the Burnley game. West Ham: Randolph, Obiang, Reid, Ogbonna, Cresswell, Kouyate, Nordtveit, Antonio, Feghouli, Payet, Lanzini. Subs: Carroll, Adrian, Noble, Ayew, Fletcher, Fernandes, Quina. Man Utd: De Gea, Valencia, Jones, Rojo, Darmian, Ander Herrera, Carrick, Pogba, Mkhitaryan, Ibrahimovic, Lingard. Subs: Mata, Martial, Smalling, Young, Rashford, Romero, Fellaini. Referee: Mike Dean (Wirral) So Mourinho is the manager more inclined to rotate. Manchester United make five changes with Jones, Rojo, Darmian, Carrick and Lingard coming in for Smalling, Fellaini, Martial, Bailly and Blind. As for West Ham, Bilic brings in Obiang, Lanzini and Feghouli for Noble, Ayew and Carroll. Afternoon/Evening. Manchester United have found their groove again haven’t they? Zlatan Ibrahimovic is hungrier than his critics and banging them in for fun, Paul Pogba has located some of his missing mojo and the defence has become a tidy functioning unit that no longer plays a thousand sideways passes before trying to go forwards. José Mourinho’s side have five league wins on the spin coming into this game. The upturn in form can’t be traced to one thing alone but the influence of the Scorpion-kick trendsetter Henrikh Mkhitaryan hasn’t half helped. His creative energy has taken some of the workload off Juan Mata. No one talks about Wayne Rooney any more either. For that we (and he) should be grateful. How West Ham would have liked to carry some momentum into this match with them. They had three consecutive wins to their name before they were beaten 1-0 at Leicester. The rapid collection of those nine points has helped them to pull away into mid-table safety and, with games against Crystal Palace and Middlesbrough to follow this one in the league, they would be very happy to take a point here. That’s what they got at Old Trafford just over a month ago. Given that the two sides met a few days later (a 4-1 League Cup win for Man Utd) it’s fair to say they are well acquainted enough to know each other’s strengths and weaknesses. They both had energy-sapping games 48 hours ago so I don’t expect a helter-skelter match anything like the one which gave the Boleyn Ground a boisterous farewell at the end of last season. Still, I think Man Utd will nick this one and keep Manchester City firmly in sight. My prediction: West Ham United 0-1 Manchester United Here’s some pre-match reading for you …','https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/jan/02/west-ham-united-v-manchester-united-premier-league-live','West Ham United v Manchester United: Premier League – as it happened',244,'football'),('us-news/2017/jan/02/republicans-congress-obamacare-repeal-replace','A Republican-dominated Congress convenes on Tuesday with a carefully crafted plan to erase much of what the Obama administration considered to be its main domestic achievements, starting with healthcare and environmental regulations. Barack Obama is seeking to rally Democrats on Capitol Hill on Wednesday for a rearguard struggle to salvage at least some of his signature legislation in the face of looming attacks over the course of the incoming Trump administration. But the party’s ability to resist is hampered by Republican legislative tactics designed to minimize the power of the minority, and by the fact that 10 Democratic senators will face re-election two years from now in states won by Donald Trump, making them reluctant to defy him. In light of such handicaps, Democrats are likely to focus their limited political resources on fighting the confirmation of Trump nominees for high office, particularly in the supreme court, and to join forces with Republican senators pushing for a thorough investigation of the Russian role in the presidential election. Republican leaders in the House and Senate have signalled that their first target in the 115th Congress will be the Affordable Care Act (ACA), widely known as Obamacare, and have made clear they will not wait for Trump’s inauguration to start dismantling it. “Repeal and replace” legislation has been developed since the ACA came into place in 2010, awaiting the arrival of a sympathetic president. The Democrats’ last line of defense is in the Senate, where they control 48 of the 100 seats, including two independents who normally vote with them. That gives them the power to hold up major legislation through filibusters that would require 60 votes to overcome. So the Republicans’ plan to start unraveling Obamacare from their first day back at work is based on the use of budget measures that require only a simple 51-vote majority, and new procedural rules that ease budget constraints on their actions. The main obstacle to the destruction of the ACA is not the Democrats, but the sheer complexity of unpicking its provisions, which offer tax credits for purchasing private health insurance and allow states to expand coverage of Medicaid, a longstanding program for low-income Americans. It may be politically necessary to replace those provisions with other forms of healthcare coverage, but House and Senate Republicans are divided on how to do that, and on the overall ambitions of their healthcare counter-revolution. Many in the House want to use Republican dominance of government to rewrite the Medicare program for the elderly that dates back to Lyndon Johnson, but there is less enthusiasm for that in the Senate. The likely outcome of such complications is that the effective date for Obamacare repeal and replacement will be deferred for several years. The other priority for the Republican majority in the first days of the new Congress will be a planned bonfire of Obama-era regulations imposed on business and industry for environmental or labor-related reasons. Top of the list are an eleventh-hour measure putting restrictions on mountaintop-removal coal mining due to take effect on 19 January, one day before Trump enters the White House, as well as rules obliging hydrocarbon industries to reduce methane emissions and reveal their payments to foreign governments for mining rights. The Republicans are planning to employ an obscure tool to kill these directives off quickly. The Congressional Review Act allows them to block regulations within 60 legislative days after their issue with a simple majority in the Senate. An additional target for repeal is the Dodd-Frank Financial Reform Act, which provides consumer protection viewed by Republicans as an undue burden on the financial sector. Republican leaders have said that an overhaul of the tax code and a new infrastructure bill are also priorities, especially as they can claim some bipartisan support. Chuck Schumer, the new Democratic leader in the Senate, has expressed guarded backing for Trump’s stated ambitions for infrastructure renewal. “We think it should be large. He’s mentioned a trillion dollars. I told him that sounded good to me,” Schumer told ABC News. However, that backing is likely to melt away when it becomes clear how much of the program is based on tax breaks for corporations rather than government spending. Observers say that the promised restructuring of the tax code is also likely to be put on hold to make way for the GOP’s overwhelming priority, destroying Obamacare. The one likely blossoming of bipartisanship in the early days of the new Congress will be the opening of an inquiry on Thursday by the Senate armed services committee into Russian hacking of the 2016 election. Democrats on the committee will join its chairman, Senator John McCain, and other Republican foreign policy hawks in seeking to focus the investigation on Moscow’s role in getting Trump elected.','https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/02/republicans-congress-obamacare-repeal-replace','Republicans\' plan to erase Obama legacy starts with chipping away at Obamacare',245,'us-news'),('australia-news/2017/jan/03/centrelinks-debt-mistake-theres-no-way-i-could-explain-to-them','When Centrelink’s letter arrived two weeks before Christmas, Michael Griffin instinctively knew he was going to be unfairly trapped. So he meticulously documented, step-by-step, how the system wrongly deemed him to have a $3,197 debt. Griffin’s ordeal began when he received the standardised letter from Centrelink, telling him there was a discrepancy between income information held by the Australian taxation office, and what he had reported fortnightly while claiming the dole in 2013. He was told to go online to his MyGov account to confirm his income details. Griffin originally claimed benefits between February and May in 2013, receiving a total of $3,754 from Centrelink. He reported working small amounts in three fortnights within those months. In two fortnights, he worked 24 hours and earned $618 a fortnight, and in the third he worked 15 hours and earned $386. Griffin has provided payslips to Guardian Australia that clearly show he reported this income accurately. He boosted his working hours in the rest of his year, while not claiming welfare, and ended up with a total income of $26,642 for the 2013-14 financial year. Centrelink’s online system asked him to confirm that he had earned $26,642, which Griffin did. This is where his problems began. Screenshots show how Centrelink’s system then averaged out his $26,000 yearly income across every fortnightly reporting period. It wrongly assumed he had consistently earned $1,021 every fortnight across the year, including between February and May, instead of different amounts in different fortnightly reporting periods. That wrong assumption made him ineligible to claim welfare for that period, and he was told he must repay almost all of the dole he claimed, a total of $3,197. “I knew that this would happen when I went on the site, but there is no way for it not to happen – no way that I could pre-emptively explain to them,” Griffin said. “Surely my situation is the default – how many people is this happening to?” he said. Guardian Australia continues to receive dozens of similar complaints about Centrelink’s compliance system, which is automatically comparing income reported to the agency with information held by other areas of government, principally the Australian taxation office. It then asks welfare recipients – at a rate of 20,000 a week – to prove they are entitled to claim benefits from up to six years ago. A key complaint about the system is that it reverses the onus of proof onto Australia’s most vulnerable and poorest groups. Victoria Legal Aid has noticed a significant jump in those coming to them for assistance on welfare debts since the system began in July. But Legal Aid lawyer Joel Townsend fears most people are not even questioning their debts, and are failing to seek legal help. “I think that one of the larger issues is the impact of automating this kind of debt collection process on the most disadvantaged people, people with mental health problems, young people, people without a good grasp of the English language,” he said. “Those people are likely to be the people who are least able to handle a system that puts the onus on them to disprove a Centrelink debt.” “Lots of people who should be seeking help with this legal issue are not doing so. And people who should be seeking reviews by Centrelink are not doing so.” The government continues to maintain confidence in the system. The Department of Human Services said it allows customers the chance to contest the discrepancy. The vast majority of people, the department says, resolve the issue online and without the need for payslips or letters of employment.','https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jan/03/centrelinks-debt-mistake-theres-no-way-i-could-explain-to-them','Centrelink\'s debt mistake: \'There\'s no way I could explain to them\'',246,'australia-news'),('commentisfree/2017/jan/02/the-guardian-view-on-grime-music-sound-of-protest','When the nominations for pop music’s Brit awards – an event considered so central to public life that it will be broadcast live on terrestrial television – are announced this month, there should be only one question that needs answering. Will the UK’s record industry finally acknowledge “grime” as this country’s most significant aural rebellion since punk? It certainly should. When last year’s Brit awards failed to nominate a single black artist in any major category, there was a chorus of outrage. Boycotts were threatened, and the hashtag #BritsSoWhite went viral. In his profanity-peppered rap One Take Freestyle, grime’s Stormzy splattered the music establishment with imprecations; “embarrassing” being the most printable. This year grime, wreathed in strong London accents and strobing bass lines, is officially the Next Big Thing. The Brits have recruited new judges who promise to be in tune with music’s changing face. Grime’s rise – from angry underground soundtrack to British pop royalty – became obvious last year when the artist Skepta’s Konnichiwa beat David Bowie to the £25,000 Mercury prize. Grime, with its recognisable staccato beats and machine-gun rapping, became popular in 2003 with rapper Dizzee Rascal’s debut album, Boy in da Corner, a shrewd breeze through the mini mean streets of London life. That precociously inventive album also won the Mercury prize in the same year. Despite the early plaudits, grime remained outside the mainstream, revelling in a playful revolt on crowded dancefloors. Its rebelliousness is encoded in its DNA. Born in London estates at the turn of the millennium, grime crackles with the high-rise tension of tower blocks amid shrinking opportunities and limited possibilities. Musically it builds up a sense of claustrophobia. But it has a message of freedom: that one can transcend narrowing horizons and overcome adversity by subverting the power of prejudice. Sometimes ethically problematic, grime is not easy listening. It stands accused of sexism, and stars admit they shouldn’t litter lyrics with the N-word. As a predominantly black musical artform it was embraced by urban youth and found itself of interest to the authorities, who were accused of racially profiling grime clubs to shut them down. But grime’s defiance – rooted in confrontation over stop and search and rave raids – found wide appeal among a youth robbed of their future by austerity. By 2011 Lethal Bizzle’s Pow! (Forward) was the unofficial soundtrack of the student protests. Five years later grime’s leading artists wear their politics as a badge of virility: speaking out against Syrian airstrikes, reviving anarchist imagery and leading fans at Glastonbury to condemn former prime minister David Cameron in ripe language. Tory culture minister Matt Hancock missed the antipathy: he gave Stormzy a “shout-out” last September. Skepta’s Shutdown, adopted by Black Lives Matter UK, is the genre’s most vivid take on partying as politics. Grime’s credibility is that it rose with little mainstream radio support and few ad campaigns. Shutdown illustrates how an alternative music business was born of indifference. The track reached 39 in the charts but clocked up 25m YouTube views. Skepta runs his own record label, which signed up hip-hop star Drake and launched a mobile phone service. Take note, Brits: grime’s revolution threatens not just to upend an industry – but to take it over.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/02/the-guardian-view-on-grime-music-sound-of-protest','The Guardian view on grime music: sound of protest | Editorial',247,'commentisfree'),('politics/2017/jan/02/len-mccluskey-corbyn-should-consider-his-position-if-polls-dont-improve','The leader of the Unite union, Len McCluskey, has insisted he still supports Jeremy Corbyn after he suggested the Labour leader would consider stepping down if the party’s opinion poll ratings remain low. McCluskey, who has been one of Corbyn’s strongest supporters, said the Labour leader and his shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, were “not egomaniacs” and would not want to keep their roles if there were no hope of victory. Speaking to the Mirror, he said: “Let’s suppose we are not having a snap election. It buys into this question of what happens if we get to 2019 and opinion polls are still awful. “The truth is everybody would examine that situation, including Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell.” McCluskey, who said his backing for Corbyn was “based on critical support”, said: “These two are not egomaniacs. They are not desperate to cling on to power for power’s sake.” But in a subsequent tweet sent from the official Twitter feed for his campaign to stay on as Unite’s general secretary, McCluskey insisted this did not mean his backing for Corbyn was ebbing away. Speaking to the Mirror, McCluskey also said Labour needed to pin down its stance on the free movement of people following departure from the EU, after different MPs expressed wildly varying assessments on the need for any change. McCluskey, whose union is a major funder of Labour, said the party could lose votes to Ukip if it did not “get its narrative right on free movement” and immigration. “We need to expose what Ukip stand for – not just anti-foreign, anti-workers’ rights, their hidden agenda on the NHS and welfare state. But it will only work if ordinary people believe Labour is listening to their concerns and has solutions.” Recent polls have shown Theresa May’s Conservatives leading Labour by around 12 points, with the prime minister’s personal ratings also considerably higher than Corbyn’s. Labour also performed dreadfully in December’s byelections in Richmond Park and Sleaford. Senior Labour figures around Corbyn have insisted the party’s poll standing will improve, but McCluskey’s comments increase the pressure on the Labour leader. McCluskey is facing his own challenge to remain as Unite’s general secretary. In a speech, his rival Gerard Coyne was to say that tightening border controls should be a fundamental part of the Brexit process. “My many conversations with Unite members leave me in no doubt that those who voted for Brexit expect that promise of an end to uncontrolled immigration from the EU to be kept, and will feel betrayed if it is not,” he was due to say. “Theresa May and other ministers should not wait until article 50 has been triggered to set out a negotiating position on free movement of labour. They should be saying now, without equivocation, that the issue is non-negotiable. There can be no compromise on the principle of taking back control of our borders.” Coyne later criticised McCluskey for seeking to be Labour’s “puppet master”. He said: “My criticism of his handling of the role of general secretary of Unite is not whether he has backed the right leader or the wrong leader of the Labour party, but that he appears to think it is his job to be Labour’s puppet master.” This in return brought an angry response from McCluskey, via Twitter.','https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/02/len-mccluskey-corbyn-should-consider-his-position-if-polls-dont-improve','Len McCluskey: Corbyn may step down if polls don\'t improve',248,'politics'),('info/2017/jan/02/removed-article','This article has been taken down on Monday 2 January 2017 pending investigation.','https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/jan/02/removed-article','Removed: article',249,'info'),('sport/2017/jan/02/thistlecrack-colin-tizzard-cheltenham-gold-cup-horse-racing','Colin Tizzard reported on Monday that his handful of stable stars remain in excellent health after their various successes over the Christmas period, and the West Country trainer hopes to have at least three runners in the Cheltenham Gold Cup 10 weeks from now. Thistlecrack, who provoked such excitement with the manner of his King George success, is already on course for a return to Cheltenham at the end of this month, when Tizzard hopes to see a more fluent round of jumping than he produced there in November. “The buildup to it all seemed to go on for ever,” Tizzard said of last week’s action, “but before you knew it, it had all come and gone. It was a fantastic few days for us. All the good horses ran right up to their best, apart from Cue Card, who might not have been quite as good. “The decisions we made worked out a treat,” he said, referring to Thistlecrack’s switch into the King George from the Kauto Star Chase, which Tizzard then won with the 33-1 shot Royal Vacation. He also landed the Welsh National at Chepstow with Native River. “Thistlecrack looked every bit as good as we hoped he would. He looked like that over hurdles and then over fences and now he’s done it to Grade One horses. He’s right at the top of his game. “When he was clear at the second-last, he shortened up and jumped it steadily with the race in the bag, which other horses couldn’t do. He’s got a big engine; he’s got everything. “The only time when his jumping looked slightly suspect was at Cheltenham and then it was only at one or two fences, when he stood off too far and landed on one. I think he learnt from that. These good horses don’t make the same mistake twice.” Just the same, Thistlecrack will return to Gloucestershire for the Cotswold Chase on 28 January for the sake of some more experience at the home of jump racing. “We’re trying to win a Gold Cup, so are we going to leave him in his box for 10 weeks? No,” Tizzard said. “He’s a big, strong boy but he quite often looks a bit tired in his stable for a few days after a race. It might appear he’s not been involved in a hard finish but I’m glad it’s five weeks between his races. That’s plenty of time to recover.” Tizzard suggested Native River might, by contrast, go straight to the Gold Cup. His ex-French seven-year-old Alary is also being aimed at that race and could make his debut for the yard in Newbury’s Denman Chase next month. Cue Card will be returned to a shorter distance in next month’s Ascot Chase before a decision is taken about whether he also lines up in the Gold Cup or tries to win a second Ryanair Chase at the Festival. The Charlie Hall Chase-winning trainer Rebecca Curtis and jockey Jonathan Moore appear to have gone their separate ways. Moore has ridden only in Ireland for the past fortnight and his second place on Aurillac at Newbury on 14 December was his most recent ride for Curtis, the 22-year-old having been named as her stable jockey only seven months before. Curtis said on Monday she did not wish to comment, while Moore did not respond to inquiries. Irish Cavalier provided both with a major success when beating Cue Card in Wetherby’s Charlie Hall in late October and they shared 19 other winners in recent months at an excellent strike rate. Curtis’s stable, near Newport on the Pembrokeshire coast, continues in form, the trainer having relied on Richard Johnson and Aidan Coleman for most of her recent runners, including a Grade Three success with Shantou Flyer at Cheltenham on Sunday.','https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/02/thistlecrack-colin-tizzard-cheltenham-gold-cup-horse-racing','Thistlecrack will spearhead Colin Tizzard team in Cheltenham Gold Cup',250,'sport'),('film/2017/jan/02/franco-rosso-obituary','The British film-maker Franco Rosso, who has died aged 75, always felt like an outsider, which may well account for the extraordinary empathy with the disaffected and marginalised that characterised his work. Beginning his career as an assistant editor on Ken Loach’s Kes (1969), he went on to create a series of hard-hitting documentaries and dramas, but it was arguably his first fiction film, Babylon (1980), that marked him out as a fearless chronicler of the dispossessed. He was born in Turin to Angela (nee Cornaglia) and Egidio Rosso who, when Franco was eight, left their jobs at the Fiat motor factory and moved to London, where his grandfather had a cafe. They settled in Streatham, south-west London, and at the local schools he attended Franco developed a defiant, rebellious streak, a necessary defence, he said, against the postwar xenophobia he encountered: “I had an accent and I was picked on heavily so I had to learn to defend myself. They called me names and beat me up because I was an ‘eye-tie’, and the ‘eye-ties’ had lost the war.” By now a sharply dressed young mod, Franco won a place at Camberwell School of Art, where RB Kitaj, Frank Auerbach and Patrick Procktor were his teachers and he was exposed for the first time to a liberal, cosmopolitan environment in which it was acceptable to be a maverick. However, more interested in social and political engagement, he eschewed the painter’s studio for the MA film course at the Royal College of Art, where he met the musician Ian Dury. Some years later he made a film about his friend. His early work assisting on Kes led that year to a job as an editor on John Lennon and Yoko Ono’s Bed Peace, as well as the promo for the single Give Peace a Chance. He then found himself directing 35 hours of film at Lennon’s Ascot home during the recording of Imagine. Lennon and Rosso had planned a warts-and-all depiction of John’s daily life, but when Lennon’s new manager Allen Klein wanted a slick TV film for the US, Rosso withdrew cooperation and the film was locked away for more than 20 years without being shown. As Joanna Smith, his second wife and producing partner, said: “He would never compromise or be bullied into things he didn’t believe in.” Rosso’s next film, The Mangrove Nine (1973), required those principles in abundance. It told the story of the nine black protesters arrested at a demonstration against police raids on the Mangrove restaurant in Notting Hill, west London, and was so uncompromising in its portrayal of police racism that the BBC delayed its transmission. For several years afterwards, Rosso could not get work with the corporation and firmly believed he had been blacklisted. Defiantly, he made Dread, Beat an’ Blood (1978), a 45-minute documentary for the Arts Council about the dub poet Linton Kwesi Johnson, but by now his sights were set on a more ambitious project, Babylon, a drama based around warring reggae sound systems in south London on which I was co-writer. Although the reggae star Brinsley Forde of the band Aswad was cast in the lead role, with no big names and a virtually non-white cast, Babylon seemed to have little chance of being made. It was only when two Franco-like outsiders – Gavrik Losey, son of the exiled Hollywood director Joseph Losey, and Mamoun Hassan, the Saudi-born head of the government-funded equivalent of today’s BFI – became involved that the finance finally came together. Shot feverishly in south London on the streets of Deptford and New Cross, it was a low-budget affair held together by the incisive cinematography of Chris Menges, a cutting-edge sound track from Dennis Bovell and the powerful performances of its young cast. Babylon won the Evening Standard’s Most Promising Filmmaker Award 1981 and was Rosso’s proudest achievement. Ian Dury (1983) followed, and new projects, produced with Joanna, whom he married in 1989, exploring familiar Rosso themes: 64 Day Hero: A Boxer’s Tale (1985) told of the life and death of the world middleweight boxing champion Randolph Turpin. Struggle for Stonebridge (1987), narrated by Johnson, was the story of disaffected black youth in Brent. The Nature of the Beast (1988) featured a young boy coming to terms with a metaphorical beast roaming the Lancashire moors after his town is shattered by unemployment. Lucha Libre (1991) showed the power of the masked wrestler in Mexico – able to fight for the poor without arrest. With indomitable integrity and humour, he had an unfailing eye for a great human story. In 1997 Rosso and Joanna left London with their son, Eduardo, aged seven, to live in a farmhouse near Ramsgate, in Kent, where Joanna had grown up. Two years later they had another son, Jaime. In later years, although a hip operation slowed him down, Rosso embarked on a whole new project – keeping chickens. He turned out to be a dab hand and, to his own amazement, won many rosettes for their splendid plumage. He is survived by Joanna, Eduardo and Jaime, and by his children Thomas and Aimee, from his first marriage to Stephanie Cleverley, which ended in divorce. • Franco Giuseppe Rosso, film-maker, born 29 August 1941; died 9 December 2016','https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/02/franco-rosso-obituary','Franco Rosso obituary',251,'film'),('football/2017/jan/02/championship-roundup-reading-bristol-city-jaap-stam','Reading came from two goals down to beat Bristol City 3-2 at Ashton Gate to stay third as they prepare for their FA Cup tie at Manchester United on Saturday. Yann Kermorgant scored two late goals, the second from 25 yards, after the on-loan Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham’s double had put the home side 2-0 up. His second, and 17th of the season, came from the spot after Tyler Blackett had fouled Callum O’Dowda. But youngster Liam Kelly, a second-half substitute who recently signed a new contract until 2019, kick-started Reading’s comeback before Kermorgant’s injury-time winner clinched an unlikely victory. The striker beat Bristol City goalkeeper Frank Fielding with a low 25-yard drive from outside the box to make it three wins from three for Jaap Stam’s side. Lee Johnson’s side, meanwhile, have now lost nine of their last 10 matches. “We don’t need radicalisation but we do need to bring some new faces in,” Johnson said. “I hope our supporters can stick with us because I do feel it will turn.” Leeds United beat Rotherham 3-0 in a Yorkshire derby at Elland Road, all the goals coming in the second half, to earn their ninth win in 12 league matches. Kyle Bartley headed home soon after half-time before Chris Wood struck twice. “There were a few choice words at half-time, we lacked urgency and it was the poorest I had seen us in a long time,” the Leeds manager, Garry Monk, said. “We can’t afford to be under 100%, we need to give the crowd a performance for 90 minutes, not just for 45.” At the summit, Brighton and Hove Albion won 2-1 at Fulham to return top, as Newcastle United slipped up at Blackburn Rovers. Chris Hughton’s side extended their unbeaten run to 18 matches after two goals in two minutes turned the game around at Craven Cottage. Lucas Piazon’s fourth goal of the season had put Fulham in front before Tomer Hemed and then defender Lewis Dunk scored quickfire second-half goals. Brighton’s last league defeat came at home to Brentford in September. Preston North End defeated struggling Burton Albion 1-0 courtesy of Callum Robinson’s goal on the brink of half‑time. Nelson Oliveira scored a hat-trick as Norwich City overcame 10-man Derby County 3-0 at Carrow Road, ending Steve McClaren’s 10-match unbeaten run. Huddersfield Town kept pace with Reading towards the summit after Nakhi Wells’s 80th-minute winner at Wigan while Wolves held sixth-placed Sheffield Wednesday to a 0-0 draw at Hillsborough. Pawel Wszolek had scored the winner for Queens Park Rangers at Wolves on Saturday and the Polish forward did the damage again as Ian Holloway’s side recorded back-to-back wins, scoring seven minutes from time to secure a 2-1 victory over Ipswich Town at Loftus Road. “It’s all about points and we’ve just got six; that feels great,” Holloway said. “It’s about building on that now.” Nottingham Forest suffered a fourth successive defeat after losing 1-0 at home to Barnsley, who struck late on through Conor Hourihane. Paul Heckingbottom’s side sit eighth in the table while Forest slid to 20th, behind Cardiff City, after Neil Warnock’s side beat visiting Aston Villa 1-0. Elsewhere, Gianfranco Zola’s wait for a first win in charge of Birmingham City goes on after losing 3-1 at home to Brentford. “I thought when we lost a little bit of confidence we started to make mistakes with the ball,” Zola said. “We were poor in transition and after the first half I did not expect that to be honest but that’s the way it is.” League One There were more away fans (3,157) than home supporters as Sheffield United recorded their first win of the new year, after coming from behind to beat Bury at Gigg Lane. Billy Sharp inspired the comeback with an equaliser after 21 minutes before Kieron Freeman completed the comeback for United who stay top. “It was a day where we did not want to get outbattled and outfought to make sure we came away with the right result,” Chris Wilder, the Sheffield United manager, said. Bolton Wanderers remain on their tails, after salvaging a point away at Coventry City, courtesy of Max Clayton’s injury-time penalty. Scunthorpe United’s Josh Morris struck his 16th goal of the season – and his first since November – but it was not enough to ensure victory, after Charlie Goode’s own goal handed Peterborough United a draw. Rochdale won 2-0 at Walsall to stay in the play-off picture while Bradford City came from behind to beat Northampton Town 2-1 at Sixfields. Fleetwood Town make up the top seven, after Devante Cole, son of former Manchester United striker Andy, struck his first league goal of the season to beat Shrewsbury Town. Millwall’s three-game winning run came to an end as they had to settle for a draw at AFC Wimbledon in the early kick-off. Aiden O’Brien and Steve Morison twice put the visitors in front before goals from Lyle Taylor and Tom Elliott respectively. Josh Magennis bagged a hat-trick as Charlton Athletic thrashed Bristol Rovers 4-1 at the Valley, to record a second win in three matches for Karl Robinson’s side, who move into 11th. Also in mid-table are Oxford United, who beat Gillingham 1-0, thanks to Chey Dunkley’s winner. Elsewhere, Chesterfield drew 0-0 with MK Dons, bottom club Oldham drew 0-0 with Port Vale and Swindon Town played out a stalemate with high-flying Southend United. League Two Doncaster Rovers moved to the top of the table at the expense of Plymouth Argyle who slipped up, losing 1-0 at Barnet. Darren Ferguson’s side secured a narrow victory late on against Stevenage thanks to Fraser Franks’ own goal. Plymouth have now lost two of their last three away league matches. Carlisle United, meanwhile, squandered the chance to topple Plymouth after losing 3-1 at home to Grimsby Town. Omar Bogle scored twice to inspire victory for Marcus Bignot’s side, who sealed victory through Adi Yussuf with 12 minutes to play. The bad run goes on for Newport County who lost a seventh straight match after Wycombe Wanderers won 2-1 at Adams Park, thanks to Paris Cowan-Hall’s late winner. As a result, Wycombe leapfrog Luton Town into fifth. Portsmouth beat Luton 1-0 at Fratton Park courtesy of defender Christian Burgess’s first-half striker. Shaun Derry’s Cambridge United extended their unbeaten league run to seven matches with a convincing 4-0 win over his former club, Notts County. Piero Mingoia sealed the victory, adding the U’s fourth after 69 minutes, to keep Cambridge seventh and level pegging with Luton. Exeter City had only scored five goals at home all season but coasted to a 4-0 win over Leyton Orient at St James Park. Liam McAlinden sealed the rout for Paul Tisdale’s side. Elsewhere, Morecambe drew 0-0 at home to Crewe, Colchester beat Cheltenham Town 2-0, Mansfield beat Blackpool 1-0 at Bloomfield Road and Accrington Stanley and Hartlepool shared the spoils after a 2-2 draw.','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/02/championship-roundup-reading-bristol-city-jaap-stam','Football League roundup: Reading stay third after comeback win at Bristol City',252,'football'),('business/2017/jan/02/shops-rising-costs-falling-consumer-spend-closures-retailers','Shops in Britain face a perfect storm of rising costs and falling consumer spending in 2017, one of the world’s leading commercial property agents has warned, raising the possibility of more closures after the demise of BHS last year. Retailers will have to contend with rising inflation, labour costs and taxes at the same time as consumers tighten their belts, piling on the pressure for businesses that are already having to deal with the rise of online shopping, according to property agent JLL. The warning of a “perfect storm” for retailers is similar to comments made by Dave Lewis, the chief executive of Tesco, in late 2015 that the industry faced a “potentially lethal cocktail”. Lewis warned that retailers faced £14bn of extra costs over the next five years due to an increase in business rates, the apprenticeship levy and the introduction of the “national living wage”. The British Retail Consortium has warned that the strain on the sector and the structural changes taking place could lead to up to 900,000 jobs being lost and 74,000 shops being closed over the next decade. In total the industry in the UK employs about 3m people and has 270,000 shops. In its annual predictions for the year ahead, JLL warned that retailers would be hurt by the weakness in sterling leading to an increase in the cost of importing goods. However, it said that any fall in consumer spending is unlikely to be uniform across the country, with major high streets and shopping centres demonstrating “resilience at the expense of less relevant centres that have been slow to respond to cyclical and structural change”. Tim Vallance, head of UK retail and leisure at JLL, said: “In 2017, retailers will endure a ‘perfect storm’ of rising inflation, labour costs, import costs and in some cases business rates, ongoing ecommerce–led structural change, in addition to a potential reduction in consumer spend. “In particular, rising import costs as a result of post-referendum currency fluctuations may have to be passed on to the consumer, or retailer margins will be cut. Larger retailers will be better positioned to bear the impact, offsetting it by currency hedging and economies of scale.” Retailers will feel particularly squeezed from April, when the national living wage will increase from £7.20 to £7.50 and business rates will move in line with the latest revaluation of Britain’s property. The revaluation of business rates is expected to result in a sharp increase in tax payments for shops in central London, supermarkets, and shopping centres. However, struggling town centres, especially in the north and west of the country, should enjoy a much-needed tax cut.','https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/02/shops-rising-costs-falling-consumer-spend-closures-retailers','Shops \'face perfect storm of rising costs and falling spending\'',253,'business'),('society/2017/jan/02/junior-doctor-nadia-masood-jeremy-hunt-driven-us-out-of-nhs','Dr Nadia Masood’s public involvement in the junior doctors’ dispute began in a layby somewhere in north-east London on 11 January. “I was driving to Essex to see my mum, who was in hospital with sepsis after having chemotherapy for breast cancer. I was listening to LBC and James O’Brien was talking about the first junior doctors’ strike, which was due the next day,” she recalls. “I pulled over, phoned in and ended up on air, trying to explain to listeners why we were going on strike. I was feeling very emotional both because of my mum and because of the strike.” It was unusual behaviour for the 35-year-old anaesthetic registrar. “I’m from a completely apolitical background. I didn’t have a political bone in my body until the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, decided to impose an unfair and unjust contract on 54,000 junior doctors,” Masood says. “At first I saw the contract as an ethical, not political, issue. It wasn’t right to impose a contract on a workforce who give up their entire lives and pour blood, sweat and tears into their jobs and have no choice but to work under the conditions the NHS gives us, because that’s the only way we can become consultants, which is our goal. I was shocked Jeremy Hunt had the balls to do it.” The next day brought the first of what would be eight strikes between January and May. They pitted young medics renowned as workhorses of the NHS against a health secretary regarded with deep suspicion by the medical profession for his disparaging comments about GPs and consultants. Doctors in scrubs on picket duty outside their hospitals vied with Hunt for public sympathy over his insistence that juniors had to work more at weekends to deliver the government’s promised “truly seven-day NHS”. Striking wasn’t easy for the doctors, who realise the uniqueness of their jobs, which they love, says Masood. On day one she was among the pickets outside Great Ormond Street hospital in London, where she worked at the time. “We were all feeling really bad about refusing to work that day. But parents brought their children outside from the wards to say hello and said they supported us, and our consultant colleagues kept everything running smoothly, which all helped.” Did junior doctors expect to win? “Yes. That 98% of junior doctors who took part in a ballot organised by the British Medical Association backed strike action to oppose a contract we argued was unfair and unsafe – that made us realise that we all felt the same shock and horror at what Hunt was doing. We all felt justified in our resistance. Maybe I can call this naivety, but I think that the right thing – truth, honour, justice – always prevails in the end,” says Masood. As walkouts, on-off negotiations and the war of words rolled on, opinion polls showed the medics were winning the battle for hearts and minds, even when they escalated their action to include withdrawal of cover from areas of life-or-death care, such as A&amp;E and maternity units. “The RMT give the impression that they don’t care [about the impact the rail strikes by their members has on the public], and people think they are being selfish and not handling things right,” Masood says. “But as junior doctors we felt that our motivation was really pure. We were genuinely concerned about the wellbeing of the NHS and genuinely believed that what we were doing was to protect it. “It wasn’t about money, though Jeremy Hunt portrayed us as money-grabbers by constantly stressing that we’d be getting a pay rise. It was about patient safety and the sustainability of the NHS. Some people thought we were against a seven-day NHS, but most doctors – especially junior doctors – already work seven days a week. “We spoke about how the NHS was already at breaking point, with too few staff and too little money to do its job properly. But no one took notice of us. But a year on, people like [the NHS England chief executive] Simon Stevens and [the NHS Providers chief executive] Chris Hopson, who distanced themselves from us a year ago, are now saying publicly what we were saying then, that the NHS is struggling with the lack of funding that it has.” Hunt has insisted hospitals have to be able to roster doctors to work more at weekends to enable the NHS to treat more patients on those days, though precisely what services he wants to be expanded remains unclear. Eight strikes did not force him to backtrack. Masood repeats what junior doctors argued repeatedly throughout the dispute: “There’s not enough doctors at the moment to staff the current service we’re trying to deliver over five days, so why has Jeremy Hunt brought in the new contract when he knows that? It’s madness to stretch a workforce that’s already too small across seven days.” In May the then chair of the BMA’s junior doctors committee endorsed a revised version of the contract, but members rejected it by 58% to 42%. In August the union threatened a series of five-day walkouts between then and Christmas, but abandoned the plans in the face of huge opposition, both internal and external. Juniors began moving on to the contract in October. So who won? “They did,” says Masood quietly, her voice trailing away. “The government have won in the short term and I’m worried that they will now do the same thing to nurses, consultants – to all NHS staff. But long term I fear that more junior doctors will decide not to train to be NHS consultants and quit, and that more people will be burned out mentally and physically.” She was one of five junior doctors who in September challenged in the high court the legality of Hunt’s decision to impose the contract. That action ended in defeat too. The dispute has left junior doctors feeling miserable and demoralised, Masood says. She is still so outraged by Hunt’s behaviour that she stepped away from her training last month, even though she is close to becoming a consultant. Her decision means an understaffed NHS is one more medic short. She is taking a career break and now works as a locum in various London hospitals. “There’s a big need for locums because there are rota gaps in every specialty in every hospital,” she says. “What Jeremy Hunt has done is driven a lot of us out of the NHS, either temporarily – like me – or permanently. He says he values us, but everything he has done has made us feel devalued. I just worry that he will do to other NHS workers what he did to us and if he does, that will kill us as a workforce, and that will kill the NHS, because there will be no one to work in it.”','https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/02/junior-doctor-nadia-masood-jeremy-hunt-driven-us-out-of-nhs','Junior doctor Nadia Masood: \'Hunt\'s driven a lot of us out of the NHS\'',254,'society'),('news/2017/jan/02/corrections-and-clarifications','• Steven Moffat is the current showrunner of Doctor Who, but he did not create the series as we said in a piece (Sherlock could be victim of stars’ success, 30 December, page 7).

Ryan Lock, 20, from Chichester, West Sussex, died on 21 December during an offensive by anti-Islamic State forces to recapture the city of Raqqa, the extremist group’s de facto capital. Lock’s father, Jon, said in a statement: “Ryan was a very caring and loving boy who would do any thing to help anyone. He had a heart of gold. We ask for privacy to allow our family to grieve.” Lock, who had no previous military experience and had worked as a chef before travelling to Syria, was one of many foreign volunteers who have joined the People’s Defence Units (YPG), the Kurdish military force fighting in northern Syria. In a letter, the YPG offered their condolences to his family, saying: “Ryan joined actively in our offensive against the terror threat that Isis caused upon Rojava, Kurdistan. Here, on the dark hours of 21 December 2016, we lost our brave companion Ryan and four other fighters in Jaeber village. “Ryan was not only a fighter providing additional force to our struggle. In fact, with his experience and knowledge he has been an example for younger fighters. While he has reached a vast amount of achievement up in our frontlines, Ryan has served the purpose of a very important bridge between us, the Kurds of Rojava. He crossed continents for the destiny of our people and humanity.” It is understood that Lock travelled to Syria last August after telling family and friends that he was going to Turkey on holiday. In a message on Facebook on 31 August, he wrote: “I’m on my way to Rojava. I lied about going to Turkey. I’m sorry I didn’t tell anyone. I love all of you and I will be back in six months.” He joined up with the YPG on 4 September where he was given the nom de guerre Berxwedan Givara, meaning “resistance Guevara”, after the Communist revolutionary Che Guevara. On 24 November he witnessed the deaths of most of his unit when it was bombed, allegedly by Turkish jets, in Arima, a village 13 miles north-east of the Isis-held city of Bab. Twelve YPG fighters were killed in the airstrike, including an American, Michael Israel, and a German national, Anton Leschek. Afterwards, Lock posted a picture of himself with facial injuries, along with the words: “We were taking a small village when we got hit by Turkish jets in the night. Two of my friends, Anton and Michael, were killed among many others. I’m staying to finish out my six months. Fuck [Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip] Erdoğan and fuck Turkey.” The United States has supported the Kurdish-led forces in their fight against Islamic State, infuriating Ankara which sees the YPG as an extension of the Kurdish PKK militants who have waged a three-decade insurgency in south-east Turkey. Turkey fears the YPG will try to connect three de facto autonomous Kurdish cantons that have emerged during the five-year war to create a Kurdish-run enclave in northern Syria, stoking the Kurds’ desire for autonomy on its own soil. Little is yet known about Lock’s motivations for joining the fight against Isis in Syria, Ozkan Ozdil, a 30-year-old north Londoner who arrived in Syria last September, said Lock was “always upbeat with a smile on his face”. He said: “I met Ryan at the academy and he graduated 10 or so days later. He was a nice guy, always telling jokes, but he didn’t make his motives obvious to me. “He was liked and seemed very motivated to be involved in fighting. He was very supportive of the Kurdish cause. He said he came to make a difference where many wouldn’t dare step up.” Mark Campbell, a Kurdish rights campaigner who was among a Kurdish delegation that visited Lock’s family on Sunday, said: “The family are understandably in a state of absolute grief at the news and will not be making any statements to the media. The thoughts and prayers of the Kurdish community are with the Lock family today and are ready to help the family in any way they can.” For the past two months Raqqa has been the focus of heavy fighting as the mostly Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) – which includes the YPG – try to drive Isis from the city. Raqqa has been under Isis control since early 2014 and is home to nearly 200,000 mostly Sunni Arabs and an estimated 5,000 IS fighters, including some of the group’s leaders. The SDF operation coincides with a campaign to recapture Mosul across the border in Iraq. The two cities are Isis’s last major strongholds after a series of heavy military losses in recent months, and are seen collectively as the key to defeating the group militarily. Lock is the third British man to be killed fighting against Isis since the first foreign volunteers arrived in Iraq and Syria in the autumn of 2014. Konstandinos Erik Scurfield, a 25-year-old former Royal Marine from Barnsley, became the first when a missile hit his combat vehicle on 2 March 2015 during heavy fighting near the north-east Syrian town of Tel Hamis. On 21 July 2016, Dean Evans, 22, a dairy farmer from Warminster, was killed by a rocket-propelled grenade as he attempted to rescue a fallen comrade during a street battle in the city of Manbij, northern Syria. A Foreign Office spokesperson said on Monday: “The UK has advised for some time against all travel to Syria. As all UK consular services there are suspended, it is extremely difficult to confirm the status and whereabouts of British nationals in Syria. Anyone who does travel to these areas, for whatever reason, is putting themselves in considerable danger.”','https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/02/briton-ryan-lock-killed-while-fighting-against-isis-in-syria','Briton killed while fighting against Isis in Syria',256,'uk-news'),('politics/2017/jan/02/jeremy-hunt-accused-of-compromising-weekday-hospital-care','The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, has been accused of compromising the care patients receive during the week by not taking forward his pledge to hire more junior doctors to help deliver a seven-day NHS. The Liberal Democrats’ health spokesman, Norman Lamb, said that with juniors now having to work more at weekends, already under-staffed hospitals had fewer medics on duty on weekdays. He said Hunt had done little to make good on the hiring pledge he made in parliament during the year-long dispute over junior doctors’ contracts. “My fear is that unless you can guarantee that there will be more junior doctors employed, imposing a change which involves more hours being worked at weekends will inevitably reduce the numbers of hours worked during weekdays when the pressure is at its greatest,” Lamb said. “This could result in real safety concerns.” In a letter to Lamb, Hunt failed to provide any detail of how many more junior medics would be trained and employed this year or any other year before the end of this parliament in 2020. He has previously acknowledged the potential for too few doctors being on duty between Monday and Friday as a result of the new contract he imposed in October on all 54,000 junior doctors working in the NHS in England. Hunt told Lamb that it was up to hospital trusts to expand their junior doctor workforce, raising doubt that his previous assurance would be acted on. Nor did the letter provide any detail on how many extra trainee medics would join the NHS this year, despite Hunt having told Lamb in the House of Commons on 5 September that he would give him a number. “This letter from Jeremy Hunt fails to reassure me,” Lamb said. “There appears to be no clear plan as to when more junior doctors will be employed and yet the changes are being imposed immediately. “There seems to have been no assessment of the number of additional junior doctors needed to ensure that additional weekend hours won’t have a dangerous effect on weekday cover. Jeremy Hunt has failed to provide the evidence to back up his claim that the problem will be addressed by additional junior doctors.” When Lamb first raised the prospect of shortfalls in weekday medical rotas affecting care standards in a Commons debate on the dispute on 19 May last year, Hunt told him: “The short answer is that we need to increase the NHS workforce.” Hunt’s letter, however, simply restated the government’s longstanding pledge that there would be 11,500 more doctors by 2020 than there were in 2015. Dr Nadia Masood, a member of the Justice For Health campaign group and the British Medical Association’s junior doctors committee, said she shared Lamb’s concerns about weekday care. “Weekday care is already suffering. The NHS is struggling every day of the week. So yes, if we are going to remove more doctors from weekday shifts to staff the weekends, weekday care will deteriorate. We need more doctors every day of the week, not just weekends,” she said. Masood said she had never believed Hunt’s pledge to recruit more junior doctors, “because he and the government have repeatedly shown themselves to be deceitful with NHS-related issues to further their own political agenda, for example [their claims about] £10bn extra funding to the NHS.” She said ministers and Health Education England, the medical training and education agency, “have no idea how many doctors we actually need. They are making it up as they go along, which is a staggeringly incompetent way to handle something as valuable as our National Health Service”. In his letter to Lamb, Hunt said: “Health Education England does not expect significant change in the overall numbers of training posts and trainees, but it cannot say how many there will be at any point in time. “The number of non-consultant non-training medical staff employed is for providers [NHS trusts] to determine based on the workforce required to deliver services … It is therefore difficult to provide the expected total number of junior doctors by grade.” The Department of Health said: “The new junior doctors contract is making it easier for hospitals to roster doctors at weekends as well as improving patient safety right across the week. Working with Health Education England, we will ensure that the NHS has a further 11,000 doctors by 2020 – as well as increasing the number of medical training places by 1,500 in a year’s time.”','https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/02/jeremy-hunt-accused-of-compromising-weekday-hospital-care','Jeremy Hunt accused of compromising weekday hospital care',257,'politics'),('football/live/2017/jan/02/sunderland-v-liverpool-manchester-city-v-burnley-clockwatch-live','Accrington Stanley 2-2 Hartlepool, Barnet 1-0 Plymouth Argyle, Blackpool 0-1 Mansfield Town, Cambridge United 4-0 Notts County, Carlisle United 1-3 Grimsby Town, Colchester United 2-0 Cheltenham Town, Crawley Town 2-0 Yeovil Town, Doncaster Rovers 1-0 Stevenage, Exeter City 4-0 Leyton Orient, Morecambe 0-0 Crewe Alexandra, Wycombe Wanderers 2-1 Newport County, Portsmouth 1-0 Luton Town.

I don’t know if Milner is injured or Herr Klopp is just concerned he might get sent off. Meanwhile at the Eithad, Pep Guardiola has replaced Kelechi Iheanacho and Jesus Navas with Sergio Aguero and David Silva.

As teams troop off for their half-time brews and bollockings, you can see the Premier League latest scores above. We’ll have them for everywhere else, shortly. League One: Josh Magennis has just headed Charlton level with Bristol Rovers from close range at the Valley, where it’s 1-1. At Sixfields, talk that Northampton have taken a 1-0 lead against Bradford City thanks to Alexander Revell might well be Cobblers. League One: It’s all square between Bury and Sheffield United, with Blades striker Billy Sharp having cancelled out Jacob Mellis’s opener for Bury. Rochadale are away to Walsall but leading 1-0 thanks to Ian Henderson. Coventry have just gone a goal up against Bolton at the Ricoh Arena, while it remains Charlton 0-1 Bristol Rovers, Shrewsbury Town 0-1 Fleetwood and scoreless everywhere else. Championship: Birmingham City have taken a one-goal lead over Brentford, with Lukas Jutkiewicz doing the honours. Bristol City’s on-loan-from-Chelsea loanee Tammy Abraham has scored again, opening his side’s account against Reading at Ashton Gate. Ian Holloway’s QPR are a goal to the good against Ipswich Town, while Cardiff and Norwich still enjoy one-goal advantages over Aston Villa and Derby County respectively. Premier League: On the advice of the fourth official, Fernandinho is sent off by referee Lee Mason for a foul on Joey Gudmundsson, who has to go off for treatment. That’s Fernandinho’s third red card in six matches: here, against Chelsea in the Premier League and Borussia Moenchengladbach in the Champions League. Premier League: Having equalised through a Jermain Defoe penalty following Ragnar Klavan’s foul on Didier Ndong, Sunderland blow a wonderful chance to go ahead. A great through ball by Adnan Januzaj releases Defoe, who tries to round Mignolet. The goalkeeper gets a touch and the ball breaks for Fabio Borini ... who shoots wide. Premier League: Defoe! Defoe! Defoe! Defoe! Defoe! Defoe! Defoe! Defoe! Defoe! Defoe! Defoe! Defoe! Defoe! Defoe! Defoe! Defoe! Defoe! Defoe! Defoe! Defoe! Defoe! Defoe! Defoe! Defoe! Defoe! Defoe! Defoe! Defoe! Defoe! Defoe!

That’s how many minutes it took Joe Ralls to give Cardiff City the lead against Steve Bruce’s Aston Villa. Championship: Stefan Johansson has had a spot-kick saved by Brighton goalkeeper David Stockdale, who dived low to his right to keep out the Norwegian midfielder’s shot from 12 yards. Premier League: Hull City have been bossing West Brom on their own patch and have now made their dominance count. Robert Snodgrass sidefoots home an Ahmed Elmohamady cross after good play from Jake Livermore. Premier League: Daniel Sturridge opens the floodgates at the Stadium of Light, taking advantage of characteristically poor defending from the hosts. Championship: Nelson Oliveira has taken some of the pressure off beleaguered Norwich City with a deflected shot aginst the Rams. League One: Bristol Rovers have taken the lead against Charlton Athletic at the Valley, courtesy of Jermaine Easter. Meanwhile at Gigg Lane, Jacob Mellis has given Bury has given Bury a one-goal lead against Sheffield United. ELsewhere, SHrewsbury are entertaining Fleetwood Town, who are beating their hosts thanks to Devante Cole’s ninth minute strike. Premier League: Dominic Calvert-Lewin, a 19-year-old Everton midfielder, has been forced off with injury and been replaced by Kevin Mirallas. Premier League: Saints full-back Cedric has been forced off with a nasty gash in his head after cracking it off an advertising hoarding or metal chair adjacent to same at Goodison Park. He’s replaced by Jack Stephens. League Two: The Exeter City striker has scored the first goal of the 3pm kick-offs, putting his side one up against Leyton Orient with his fourth goal in four games. Premier League: Kelechi Iheanacho, Yaya Toure and Raheem Sterling all spurn decent shooting opportunities in quick succession as Manchester City put Burnley under the cosh in the early stages of their game at the Etihad. League One result: AFC Wimbledon and Wimbledon drew 2-2 in the early kick-off in the third tier. Millwall go seventh, behind Southend on goal difference. Wimbledon move to 11th. Players the length and breadth of the UK have completed their pre-match formalities and referees are giving shrill blasts on their whistles. Who’ll score first? My metaphorical money’s on Sadio Mane. Jurgen Klopp makes just one change for Liverpool, bringing in Daniel Sturridge instead of Jordan Henderson (Lallana moves back into midfield), prompting some bemusement from Liverpool fans on Twitter, who think he should have rotated in the face of such feeble opposition. By contrast, Pep Guardiola seems to have made four changes to the team that lost against Liverpool less than 48 hours ago. In Josh Maja, George Honeyman, Michael Ledger and Elliot Embleton, Sunderland have four players on the bench against Liverpool with three senior appearances between them and a combined age of 77. Wahbi Khazri, Javier Manquillo and third choice goalkeeper Mika are the comparative veterans, with 24 appearances between them and an identical combined age of 77. Sunderland also have Jan Kirchoff, Lee Cattermole, Jordan Pickford, Duncan Watmore and Paddy McNair out long term, while Wahbi Khazri, Lamine Kone and Papy Djilobodji are all off to the Africa Cup of Nations. Throw in the fact they are fairly useless and have no money to bring anyone in during the January transfer window and you’d have to say that both their short and long-term future looks extremely bleak. When they get gubbed today, I wouldn’t be one bit surprised to see David Moyes walk away. He’s been sold a mangy pup.

Head coach Aitor Karanka is hoping to complete a move for the £6m-rated 28-year-old imminently after Boro formalised their interest in the player. Karanka’s promoted side have made a creditable start to their bid to remain in the Premier League, but goals have been at a premium and the Spaniard is keen to boost the firepower at his disposal for the second half of the campaign. Boro are currently entertaining Leicester City at the Riverside, where it is scoreless after 74 minutes. You can follow the action with Gregg Bakowski. There’s going on in League One and League Two also and we’ll be bringing you the most important updates from those particular divisions as well. League One AFC Wimbledon v Millwall, Bury v Sheffield United, Charlton Athletic v Bristol Rovers, Chesterfield v MK Dons, Coventry City v Bolton Wanderers, Gillingham v Oxford United, Northampton Town v Bradford, Oldham Athletic v Port Vale, Scunthorpe United v Peterborough United, Shrewsbury Town v Fleetwood Town, Swindon Town v Southend United, Walsall v Rochdale. League Two Accrington Stanley v Hartlepool., Barnet v Plymouth Argyle, Blackpool v Mansfield Town, Cambridge United v Notts County, Carlisle United v Grimsby Town, Colchester United v Cheltenham Town, Crawley Town v Yeovil Town, Doncaster Rovers v Stevenage, Exeter City v Leyton Orient, Morecambe v Crewe Alexandra, Portsmouth v Luton Town, Wycombe Wanderers v Newport County. All 24 teams kick-off at 3pm (GMT) in England’s second tier, where league leaders Newcastle travel to Ewood Park to play third-from-bottom Blackburn and their closest rivals Brighton leave London-by-the-Sea to go to actual London and play Fulham. A whopping 11 points clear of safety at the foot of the table, Rotherham visit Leeds, while second-from-bottom Wigan entertain Huddersfield. We’ve a reasonably busy day of Premier League action which has already kicked off at the Riverside Stadium, where Middlesbrough are entertaining Leicester City. It’s scoreless there after 35 minutes and Gregg Bakowski is monitoring proceedings. West Ham host Manchester United later, but sandwiched between the two games we’ve got four 3pm (GMT) kick-offs: Everton v Southampton, Manchester City v Burnley, Sunderland v Liverpool and West Brom v Hull City. We’ll have team news and build-up, then bring you updated on all the goals, scorpion kicks, the increasingly haggard look on David Moyes’s face and everything else throughout the afternoon.','https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/jan/02/sunderland-v-liverpool-manchester-city-v-burnley-clockwatch-live','Sunderland 2-2 Liverpool, Manchester City 2-1 Burnley: clockwatch – as it happened',258,'football'),('society/2017/jan/02/medieval-county-boundaries-are-one-thing-economic-geography-another','As chief executive of Barnsley council up to 2012 I was party to the early, difficult discussions about the formation of the Sheffield city region; difficult because Derbyshire county council (and, similarly, Nottinghamshire county council) refused to engage in a sensible discussion about adapting institutional arrangements to reflect the reality of the economic geography of the sub-region. Economic data shows that Chesterfield is indeed part of the Sheffield city region economic area. The economic centre of gravity of Derbyshire itself lies to the south, in Derby’s relationship with Nottingham and Leicester. Your editorial (Derbyshire’s dilemma pits cash against identity and democracy, 29 December) is wrong to say this argument is about council cuts and local councils “clutching at any cash straws they can”. Rather, it is about Chesterfield having the freedom to take its own decisions on its economic future, free from the dominion traditionally exercised by the county council. This need not threaten the historic and ceremonial ties with Chesterfield as part of Derbyshire, or even the pattern of most local service provision for Chesterfield residents. But it does require a change in the imperial mindset of the county council towards its district councils. The leadership of Chesterfield council should be congratulated for challenging the status quo, in the economic interests of their residents. Phil Coppard Rotherham • As the daughter of a former town clerk of Chesterfield, who worked so hard on behalf of Chesterfield borough council to achieve intermediate area status for the town in 1974, it was so sad to read of the present council’s attempt to attach itself to the emerging city region of Sheffield. Intermediate area status gave Chesterfield economic stability and offered no threat to its historic identity. How depressing that the government’s draconian reduction of the grant to local authorities and its insensitivity to long-established local roots is reducing Chesterfield to such an undignified scramble for survival. Clare Pitkin Edinburgh • It is not true that “there has never been any serious tradition of Chesterfield regarding itself as part of Greater Sheffield”; for 15 years from 1979 to 1994 Chesterfield, North East Derbyshire and Sheffield elected a member of the European Parliament. As the first MEP for the constituency 1979-84, I can say at first hand that the whole constituency benefited, not just through local government but also the ties with two world-class universities, the counties’ second largest teaching hospital and one of only four children’s hospitals in the country. Not only are they major employers but the spin-off from these institutions through their knowledge bank and economic clout benefits not only the cultural and sporting fabric of the Sheffield city region, but the whole region’s manufacturing and wealth-creating base, which includes Chesterfield. Bassetlaw too has expressed a desire to become part of the Sheffield city region. Richard Caborn Sheffield • Having commuted between Sheffield and Derby via Chesterfield along the A61 for 15 years, I found your leader struck several chords. In a mobile society, issues of local identity can no longer be seen in purely binary terms, and all sorts of practical and emotional belongings are projected onto historical and municipal boundaries. Similarly, many communities that find themselves between two staging posts have a certain Janus quality, and road and rail links afford Chesterfield both a northward and southward perspective. What is more, Chesterfield is served by both BBC Radio Derby and BBC Radio Sheffield, indicating that radio waves and local identity are less respectful of boundaries than we might suppose. Keith Albans Sheffield • When I played football for my grammar school here in Derby we had an annual fixture with a school in Sheffield. The steel city seemed to be in a distant land and locals stood on the touchline baying “Derbyshire born, Derbyshire bred, strong in’t arm weak in’t head’. I was one of the 92% of respondents opposed to Chesterfield joining Sheffield when the county council organised its online poll. I would like to think that the late Tony Benn (MP for Chesterfield 1984-2001) would have voted likewise. Dennis Ruston Derby • County identity is a key aspect of Englishness, and Derbyshire is not the only historic county under threat. Despite ambitions by some in the city councils of Southampton and Portsmouth to split Hampshire – mentioned in the Anglo Saxon Chronicle entry for AD755 – into two or more parts, a recent Ipsos Mori survey showed only 22% of Hampshire residents favoured such a division. Parish councils in East Hampshire have expressed deep concern at being included in a Greater Portsmouth or Solent City, as well they might, with some being closer to Reading or Guildford than they are to Portsmouth, let alone Southampton. Modern patterns of economic life are complex and there are no clear straight lines that put us into clear and distinct areas. Hampshire probably splits into at least six economic areas that overlap each other. What we do know is that to split administrative areas and disaggregate services is expensive and loses economies of scale. I am so grateful the government has recognised these facts and resisted moves to split this and other counties. Cllr Roy Perry Leader, Hampshire county council • Ministers may well mess with medieval county boundaries “at their peril’ but older people in Rhyl, Prestatyn and St Asaph have resided in three counties since the 1970s without ever having moved house. First in Flintshire (then a county in three separate parts), before local government reorganisation in 1974 placed them in Clwyd. With the demise of Clwyd they now find themselves in Denbighshire, while Flintshire has been reinstated as a smaller county, and without its exclaves, the larger of which had been situated between Denbighshire and Shropshire. Proposals for Chesterfield to be an exclave of a Greater Sheffield seem straightforward in comparison. Anthony Blane Nottingham • The dilemma facing Derbyshire is, as you suggest, played out in many other parts of England, not least in the north. New local government structures have been imposed on a reluctant population and the latest move to unaccountable city regions is a further step away from democratic government. The one crumb being offered in some city regions is elected city mayors. Yet, unlike Greater London, they will not be scrutinised by an elected assembly. In Greater Manchester many people in towns such as Bolton, Oldham, Rochdale and Wigan (all of which once had strong local government, now hollowed-out shells) regard themselves as Lancastrians – not “Greater Mancunians” – and above that, as northerners. A new constitutional settlement for the north should recognise these identities, instead of trampling on them. Professor Paul Salveson Bretherton, Lancashire • Never mind the angst over Chesterfield and the Sheffield city region. Here in Cheshire the equivalent happened two years ago, with the inclusion of the borough of Halton in the Liverpool city region. Although contiguous with other boroughs in the city region, Halton is constitutionally one of the four boroughs that make up the county of Cheshire. The sizeable part of the borough to the south of the Mersey is actually part of the historic county palatine of Cheshire. The consequences for the voters of Halton are mind-boggling. For services such as economic development, transport and housing they must look to Liverpool city region, for whose “metro mayor” they have a vote. For the main local government services, education and personal social services, they continue to look to Halton borough, for whose council they have a vote and one of whose members is mayor of Halton itself. The police service (like the fire service) is a county function, so they also have a vote for the Cheshire police and crime commissioner. And for all legal and ceremonial purposes Halton is fully part of Cheshire county under the lord lieutenant. It is true that our country can no longer define itself by the coherence or equity of its policies, but even so this is a truly tangled web. Ironically the sleepy rural village of Daresbury, at the eastern edge of Halton and the birthplace of Rev Charles Dodgson (Lewis Carroll), can now if it wishes see itself as a dynamic part of the thrusting new Liverpool city region! Robin Wendt Chester • The 1969 Redcliffe Maud report recommended abolition of all local authorities (except London) and the creation of city regions based on large towns which were already employment, commercial and recreational centres and, crucially, to my mind, centres of local travel patterns.&nbsp; The election of the Conservatives in 1970 saw the end of this sensible proposal, since counties, widely run by Tories, saw in the plan the loss of their local political power. As a result we ended up with a dog’s breakfast of a local government structure made worse by the abolition of metropolitan counties in 1986 and now the creation of disparate unitary authorities in some parts of the country.

Calling it To Walk Invisible, which refers to the sisters’ wish to maintain anonymity after they began to publish, was a misnomer, leading me, at least, to expect a&nbsp;play concentrating on them and their writing, not on the dismal subject of Branwell’s decline. As it is, more could have been shown of the expectations and hopes his family had of him when he was seen as a brilliant poet and painter. As for the swearing, this is an example of modern authors using quite inappropriate obscenities just because they can. It jerks one right out of period, whether Branwell would have used the F-word or not. If he had, the reaction of his father and sisters would have been much greater. Lynne Reid Banks Author of Dark Quarter: The Story of the Brontës and Path to the Silent Country • In Sally Wainwright’s intelligent reimagining of the Brontës the hills certainly were alive with the sound of music – incessantly, and not in a good way. It suffocated mood and dialogue. Happens all the time, signalling lack of confidence in the material on the part of producers and directors.

The presence of American soldiers was a temporary wartime expedient, and the treatment these young men received, particularly those who were black, was partially because they would not be staying. Moreover, while African Americans were certainly welcomed, this reflected not only British hospitality but also anti-American sentiment as much as a rejection of American racism. British publicans, for example, objected to being told by white Americans who they could or could not serve. As one Briton noted: “I don’t mind the Yanks, but I can’t say I care for those white chaps they’ve brought with them.” Dr&nbsp;Simon Topping Senior lecturer in United States history, Plymouth University • Join the debate – email guardian.letters@theguardian.com • Read more Guardian letters – click here to visit gu.com/letters','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/02/wartime-britains-welcome-for-black-gis-was-complicated','Wartime Britain’s welcome for black GIs was complicated | Letters',261,'world'),('music/2017/jan/02/i-choose-to-have-fond-memories-of-2016','What I choose to remember about 2016: Adele at Glastonbury.

It leaves them five points behind the leaders Chelsea, who visit Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Klopp appeared personally affronted by this setback. Irritated by the Anfield manager’s annoyance at not winning, David Moyes mischievously suggested that had he been German rather than Scottish he might have collected some praise for choreographing a resilient, pressing performance which keeps his third-bottom team in touching distance of safety from relegation. If Defoe was, once again, Moyes’s saviour, it should be acknowledged that Liverpool’s Sadio Mané discarded two points for the visitors with a ludicrous handball in the 84th minute. That came 12 minutes after Mané had given the visitors the lead for the second time on an afternoon when Daniel Sturridge also scored, and impressed enormously, before limping off with an unspecified ankle injury the manager trusts is not overly serious. Jordan Pickford’s knee injury has offered Mannone a chance to show off his goalkeeping reflexes and they looked reassuringly sharp as the Italian dived smartly to repel Sturridge’s early low shot before tipping away Georginio Wijnaldum’s curler. It was a bitter afternoon, with temperatures hovering just above freezing, but Mannone must have felt increasingly warm as he kept out another curving shot, dispatched by Sturridge this time, following some fine approach work on Roberto Firmino’s part. Mannone, though, is only human and after his defence had failed to deal with the fallout from a James Milner corner in the 20th minute, Dejan Lovren’s miscued shot bounced into Sturridge’s path and from around six yards out, the sometime England striker directed a looping header into the net. While that was only Sturridge’s second Premier League goal this season, Defoe soon registered his 10th, equalising from the penalty spot after Didier Ndong stole between Wijnaldum and Ragnar Klavan as he accelerated into the area and the latter sent him tumbling. Although Simon Mignolet guessed the direction correctly, Defoe’s low, unerring execution proved far too good for the Belgian keeper as the ball arrowed snugly inside a post and into the bottom corner. West Ham remain extremely keen on spiriting Sunderland’s leading scorer back to east London but that represents a doomsday scenario Moyes surely cannot even bear to contemplate. Within minutes of drawing level, Sunderland should have taken the lead after Adnan Januzaj’s fancy footwork set up Defoe for a shot Mignolet performed wonders to get a hand to and push away, with Fabio Borini directing the rebound wide. Moyes had dubbed his players “useless” – among other things – after they surrendered 4-1 at Burnley on Saturday but rearranged in a 4-4-1-1 formation they, initially at least, seemed in much better shape. So much so that Mignolet was required to make a couple of decent saves from Defoe and then Jack Rodwell before Sturridge scored the opener. Klopp, meanwhile, simply looked frozen through as he shivered on the touchline. The German was furious about having to play again less than 48 hours after his side’s New Year’s Eve tea-time win over Manchester City and as Liverpool’s attempts to bypass John O’Shea and Papy Djilobodji in the Sunderland defence became increasingly jaded, those dire prophecies of physical and mental fatigue appeared close to fulfilment. Yet even though the visitors were missing the injured Jordan Henderson and Philippe Coutinho, and were further hampered by rather flat displays from Adam Lallana, Emre Can and Wijnaldum in particular, they continued to dominate possession and should really have regained the lead when Nathaniel Clyne crossed well but Mané somehow missed the most inviting of openings. Moyes was convinced his team should have had another penalty after Borini’s chip struck Can on an arm but it did not look deliberate and the referee had no hesitation about waving play on. Liverpool, meanwhile, felt they might have had a penalty of their own due to Seb Larsson’s tug on Clyne. It seemed the sort of day when set pieces would decide matters but Klopp’s players belatedly rallied and proved they were not quite all out of ideas after all. Lallana and Sturridge exchanged passes before Lallana’s cute backheel cued the striker up for an angled shot Mannone performed acrobatics to divert to safety. When the resultant corner was inadvertently flicked on by Djilobodji, it fell to Mané who, completely unmarked at the far post, guided it into the net from close range. Not for the first time, Sunderland paid the price for slapdash defending, with their protestations Mané had been in an offside position irrelevant as Djilobodji’s intervention played him onside. Creditably refusing to fold, Moyes’s side fought back and won another penalty. It came after Defoe collapsed in the face of a joint challenge from Lucas Leiva and Can and Larsson’s resultant free-kick was handled by, of all people, Mané who blatantly, ridiculously, stuck an arm up. Up stepped Defoe again. This time, he sent Mignolet the wrong way, the ball flying low into the same corner as his first as Sunderland stuck two strictly metaphorical fingers in Klopp’s direction.','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/02/sunderland-liverpool-premier-league-match-report','Liverpool drop two points as Jermain Defoe strikes twice from the spot',263,'football'),('football/2017/jan/02/manchester-city-burnley-premier-league-match-report','This hard-fought win left lingering uncertainty over just how good Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City are. There was little of the carousel pass-and-move play the Catalan yearns for and though victory is the bottom line, no hard evidence exists his side will secure a Champions League place for next season, never mind the title. With Ilkay Gündogan out for the rest of the season due to injury, Guardiola could ill-afford to lose another midfielder. Yet off went Fernandinho in the first half for a second Premier League red card (and third in all) to rule him out for four games, thus taking City’s tally to seven dismissals this season. Guardiola was decidedly upset and in his subsequent refusal to accept the side have a disciplinary problem indicated he is feeling the strain. City were gifted the ideal moment to blow away the blues from their defeat at Liverpool during the first exchanges. A careless pass from Ben Mee ceded possession and Kelechi Iheanacho was through on Tom Heaton. The goalkeeper showed his quality as he smothered the Nigerian’s shot and when the ball diverted to Yaya Touré he might have attempted a shot himself. Instead, he found Raheem Sterling and when the forward let fly Heaton once more saved Burnley. Seconds later Touré easily turned the away defence and slipped in Iheanacho but after the forward dallied, Michael Keane made a block. Kevin De&nbsp;Bruyne disappointed by firing the subsequent corner straight at George Boyd and this became the tale of City’s afternoon: a series of let-downs near Burnley’s goal. When Sterling led a breakaway following a rare Burnley corner his pace took him into opposition territory. Yet after the ball went to Jesús Navas the Spaniard’s left-foot cross lacked conviction. Navas was one of four changes Guardiola made for the match – he dropped David Silva, John Stones, Sergio Agüero and Pablo Zabaleta and in came Iheanacho, Bacary Sagna and Gaël Clichy. Fernandinho’s sending off came in the 32nd minute after he tackled Johann Berg Gudmundsson with both feet raised. It appeared the correct decision and from this point City became more ragged and the first half ended with Aleksandar Kolarov, De&nbsp;Bruyne and Sterling all having been outmuscled. Only Touré had been an asset against a Burnley team that offered scant threat. Guardiola may have had a few choice words for his players during the half-time interval. He also appeared to admit his error in selecting Navas and Iheanacho as on came Silva and Agüero. The manager had also implored the City crowd to make more noise but after a brief increase in volume they became as becalmed as their team. If the idea of introducing Silva was to increase the tempo there was an early sign it might work. His interplay with the under-par De Bruyne led to the ball being under Agüero’s feet in the area but Stephen Ward cleared. But then came the opener: Sagna floated in a ball from the right and it went all the way across the area to Clichy. After a shimmy the left-back let go with his right boot and scored only the third goal of his City career. Four minutes later the lead was doubled. De&nbsp;Bruyne raced forward and delivered his best pass of the match, to Sterling, who received and advanced on Heaton. But the forward fell over, which allowed the goalkeeper to stab at the ball only for it to fall to Agüero and his shot pinballed off a post and Matthew Lowton’s arm into the net to make it 2-0. It took Agüero to 17 for the season and to third on the all-time list for the club, equal with Colin Bell’s 153 goals. At this point City should have coasted but instead Burnley pulled one back. Claudio Bravo flapped at a corner and from the ensuing melee Mee forced the ball home – marginally, goal-line technology showed. City were not happy and surrounded the referee, Lee Mason, and assistant referee Ian Hussin, which led to a yellow card for Sagna. The home side just about clung on – Keane went close at the death – and Guardiola must be concerned at precisely where they go from here. The Burnley manager, Sean Dyche, said: “Bravo? I’ve seen it back, I think it’s just a goal. Two honest challenges, it drops then goes in. Just part of the game. I actually thought we did better 11-v-11. The way we shut them down from playing out was very good.” City are on 42 points, seven behind the leaders, Chelsea, who also have a game in hand. Cue more irritability from Guardiola regarding their title prospects. “Yesterday, no,” he replied. “Why are we in the title race today?”','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/02/manchester-city-burnley-premier-league-match-report','Manchester City’s 10 men sink Burnley thanks to Clichy and Agüero',264,'football'),('sport/2017/jan/02/roger-federer-smooth-win-hopman-cup-return-from-injury','Roger Federer marked his long-awaited comeback from injury with a confident straight-sets victory over Dan Evans to help Switzerland defeat Great Britain in their Hopman Cup opener in Perth, Western Australia, on Monday. The 35-year-old Federer, representing his nation in the mixed team event that he first won back in 2001, needed only an hour and three minutes to dispatch Evans 6-3, 6-4 in the Perth Arena. Belinda Bencic then secured an unassailable 2-0 lead for the Swiss with a 7-5, 3-6, 6-2 win over Heather Watson in the women’s singles before combining with Federer to secure a 3-0 clean sweep with victory in the mixed doubles. It was Federer’s performance in the men’s singles that grabbed the attention though, with the 17-time grand slam winner showing little sign of rust despite missing six months of last season’s action with knee and back problems. He opened the match with an ace before breaking Birmingham’s Evans in the sixth game of the first set. The British No3 effectively handed Federer the match by dropping serve in the second-set opener and half an hour later, the former world No1 had put the first point on the board for Switzerland. Federer said: “I’d like to live it again. I’m a little bit sad it’s over, because it was so nice out there. I was actually quite emotional. I thought for a first match it was great, because my expectations were obviously quite low.” Asked what keeps him going, Federer said: “I guess it depends also on how you get [injured]. I got hurt filling up a bath for my children. It’s not really the way I wanted to leave this game.” Federer has not won a grand slam title since Wimbledon in 2012. “It would be nice to win another one, of course I’d even take two, three, four,” he said. “It’s tough at the top. A lot of good guys are there right now, a lot of young guys are coming up too. The gap’s definitely not very big but I will give it a chance. Let’s see what happens.” Andy Murray, meanwhile, is hoping to start the new year in winning style on Tuesday when he begins the season at the Qatar Open against Jérémy Chardy, the Scot’s first appearance at the Doha tournament since 2014.','https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/02/roger-federer-smooth-win-hopman-cup-return-from-injury','Roger Federer completes smooth win in Hopman Cup as Swiss defeat GB',265,'sport'),('football/2017/jan/02/everton-southampton-premier-league-match-report','Ronald Koeman had an open goal against his former club but declined the chance to credit Everton’s late victory with the introduction of Enner Valencia. “Maybe the reason Everton were much better than Southampton in the last 30 minutes was because they had one less day to recover,” said the manager who switched from St&nbsp;Mary’s to Goodison Park last summer. Honesty was the best policy; Southampton were physically and mentally shattered by the time Romelu Lukaku brought their cheerless festive campaign to a close. Valencia, the Ecuador international on a season-long loan from West Ham United, was a major factor in a third consecutive league defeat for Claude Puel’s side, opening the scoring 11 minutes after replacing Aaron Lennon and winning the penalty that enabled Leighton Baines to kill the contest shortly afterwards. Lukaku’s vast second-half improvement also contributed to breaking the visitors and he sealed Everton’s victory with an emphatic finish in dying minutes, his 89th goal on his 200th appearance in English football. But there was no disguising the consequences of three games in six days on the visitors. Southampton had the edge in the first half, Jay Rodriguez squandering a fine opportunity, and there was little between the teams until Koeman increased his attacking options with Valencia, and Lukaku thrived with the extra support as the weary, retreating visitors cracked. “We started the season with many games,” Puel said. “We have played every three days, sometimes two, and we are 10th in the table with a programme like Real Madrid and Barcelona. Since Boxing Day we have played three games in five days and it is just not possible [three in six]. We tried to give a good answer, we did for 70 minutes, but we couldn’t give a good answer in the end. For a long time it was a balanced game. It is difficult to accept this result.” Everton, who are close to signing the Charlton Athletic teenager Ademola Lookman in a deal worth around £11m, gratefully accepted the chance to stretch tired legs. Ross Barkley, the impressive 18-year-old Tom Davies, Séamus Coleman and, most of all, Lukaku probed continually late on, stayed patient, and punished a Southampton side that featured six changes to the team beaten by West Bromwich Albion on New Year’s Eve and lost Cédric Soares within seconds of the kick-off when he careered into advertising hoardings and suffered a head injury. Puel must have been resigned to a long afternoon from that moment on. Koeman started with Davies and the 19-year-old Dominic Calvert-Lewin in an attempt to freshen his options – the first time two teenagers have started a Premier League game for anyone this season – but the striker’s full debut came to an unfortunate and abrupt halt when he suffered an ankle injury. The disruption and fatigue produced a sterile first half in which Southampton’s defensive organisation and intelligence on the counterattack held firm. They should have led when Rodriguez collected Jordy Clasie’s ball with his back to goal, spun away from Davies, evaded Ashley Williams and, with only Joel Robles to beat, skied his shot high over the bar. A costly miss. Unsurprisingly, Everton’s energy levels told as the game wore on, with Lukaku’s influence improving in tandem with his first touch. Coleman’s raids down the right offered an important outlet against a deep defence and they combined to telling effect for the breakthrough. Lukaku released the Irishman to the byline and also met the inviting cross that came back with a downward header. Fraser Forster saved with a foot, the rebound bounced off Lukaku’s thigh and dropped perfectly for Valencia to convert from close range his first club goal for 12 months. Valencia was then up-ended by Maya Yoshida as he attempted to turn on a pass inside the penalty area. Southampton had no complaints as Baines, Everton’s captain for the day, sent their goalkeeper the wrong way from the spot. Everton’s final goal was reward for Lukaku’s second-half contribution and evidence of Southampton’s lethargy. José Fonte was easily dispossessed by Baines as he attempted to bring the ball out of defence and Davies pierced the visitors’ defence with a fine ball into the feet of the Belgium international. Forster had no chance as an unstoppable shot flew high into his net. “We needed something different up front,” Koeman said on the introduction of Valencia. “That’s why we started with Dominic behind Romelu. I wasn’t happy with the support from the midfield for Romelu in recent weeks but then we lost Dominic and you need to change it. “You either bring Enner straight in or wait until late in the game. He was one of the players who changed the game and created difficulties for Southampton. It’s good to have him, he can play different positions and gives me the possibility to change systems, but it’s still too early to make a final decision about his future.”','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/02/everton-southampton-premier-league-match-report','Enner Valencia the catalyst as Everton secure win over Southampton',266,'football'),('world/2017/jan/02/mass-molestation-bangalore-blamed-on-indians-copying-west','An alleged “mass molestation” on the streets of one of India’s biggest cities on New Year’s Eve was the result of young people trying to “copy” western mindsets and clothing, an Indian state minister has claimed. Thousands of people gathered on two central streets in Bangalore on Saturday night to celebrate the new year. Local newspaper reports and witnesses said the crowd became unruly and began to subject women to sexual assault and harassment. The Bangalore Mirror said its photojournalists were “first-hand witnesses to the brazen, mass molestation of women” on the city’s streets, publishing pictures of one woman pressed in by a crowd of men and another appearing to cower on the shoulder of a female police officer. One witness told the Guardian: “I saw women being molested in the crowd and people trying to find places where they could hide themselves and not be attacked.” “There were inhuman acts,” said Sammy, who asked for his surname to be withheld. “People were acting like they were helping the women, but actually they were molesting them, insulting them, just provoking them. “Any girl who was passing through those streets was at least being monitored with [the men’s] eyes. That was the minimum,” he said. “The maximum was that even if she was suffocated and someone was trying to pick her up, there would be lots of people trying to grab her. I couldn’t stand it; I felt helpless.” Chaitali Wasnick, a photographer, wrote on Facebook that a man had tried to grope her on Saturday night as she was coming back from work. “With so much ease he did [it], as if he thought I’ll not utter a word,” she said. No police officers intervened, even as she fought the man off, she said. Police in the city said they were badly outnumbered by the crowd in the area but received no official complaints of sexual assault, considered a massively underreported crime in India. “We had deployed 1,600 police personnel in the area for new year’s celebrations and around 60,000 people had come there that night,” said Nagaraj, the inspector at the Cubbon Park police station, who like many Indians uses only one name. “But we had the situation under control. However, if such incidents did take place that night, we urge people to come forward and file complaints.” G Parmeshwara, the home minister for Karnataka state, appeared to brush aside the incident on Monday in comments to the news agency ANI. “[On] events like new year’s … there are women who are harassed or treated badly,” he said. “These kinds of things do happen.” He said the problem was that the young people who had gathered in the city’s streets “were almost like westerners”. “They tried to copy the westerners, not only in their mindset but even in their dressing,” he said. “So some disturbance, some girls are harassed, these kinds of things do happen.” He added that he could not “force people to dress like Kannadigas” – people belonging to the Kannada cultural group that dominates the state. Bangalore, a hub for India’s tech industry, is safer than the Indian capital, Delhi, but still records the third-highest number of attacks intended “to outrage the modesty” of women, according to the country’s crime statistics bureau. Surveys cited by Amnesty International have shown that only 1% of Indian women who experience sexual violence report it to the police. Parameswara said police in Bangalore would hold discussions to “see if there are any alternatives to this kind of events so that women and children are safe”. Last year, police reportedly sent pre-New Year’s Eve text messages to hundreds of thousands of men who had been charged with sex offences, warning them to behave during festivities on the night and that they and their phones were “still under observation”.','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/02/mass-molestation-bangalore-blamed-on-indians-copying-west','‘Mass molestation’ in Bangalore blamed on Indians ‘copying’ west',267,'world'),('books/2017/jan/02/on-eve-of-costa-awards-experts-warn-that-top-books-prizes-are-harming-fiction','Cutting-edge British literary fiction risks being undermined by its growing reliance on a handful of powerful book prizes, a leading literary agent has warned. But the associated costs of entering the biggest awards mean independent publishers willing to take risks on “difficult” works without obvious marketing potential are being shut out of contention. The warnings, from Jonny Geller of Curtis Brown, come as the Costa book of the year judges prepare to announce the shortlist for the £30,000 award. He said: “Literary fiction is under threat in this country due to a combination of factors – reluctance by major houses to take risks; a bottleneck in the distribution chain [and] diverse voices being ignored by a predominantly white, middle-class industry.” Literary prize culture had exacerbated the situation, added Geller, whose clients include Man Booker winner Howard Jacobson and William Boyd, who won the Costa novel of the year in 2006. “Every major literary prize is under the same pressures – the balance between picking books that break new ground, challenge readers and those books that will be popular,” he said. Some small publishers say the cost of entering the three top awards – the Man Booker, the Baileys prize for women’s fiction and the Costa books of the year – alongside pressure on juries to choose winners that have sponsor-pleasing commercial impact, rather than “difficult” books less appealing to general readers, mean they are wary of entering experimental work. “It’s such a huge cost that most small publishers can’t do it,” said Adele Ward of the independent firm Ward Wood. “I can only cover the fee, but some of the awards also charge a lot for the awards ceremony.” Though her authors have had success with prestigious smaller prizes, including LGBTQ awards, she said the three top book prizes were the only ones that really affected sales The biggest three prizes, including the Costas, require a £5,000 fee from publishers if a book is shortlisted. This is a contribution towards marketing and should, the organisers claim, be offset by increases in sales. However, one independent publisher whose books have fared well with the three awards said hard calculations had to be made about which authors cold recoup such investment. “If the shortlisted publisher also has to fly their author over from, say, Australia and put them up in a hotel for a few days to take part in the events in the run-up to the awards dinner, it is possible that the costs exceed the financial benefits,” the publisher said. The value of book prizes in propelling sales in a sector that has struggled against commercial genres was illustrated before Christmas when The Essex Serpent by Sarah Perry topped the bestselling fiction charts after being shortlisted for the Costa novel of the year and being chosen by Waterstones as its book of the year. According to publisher Profile Books, its sales more than doubled, taking it ahead of established genre bestsellers by Ian Rankin and Lee Child. Perry acknowledged shortlisting was crucial for literary authors. “Prizes bring to readers’ attention books that might otherwise have passed them by, including books by writers from communities often marginalised in the arts – which of course can then transform writers’ careers,” she said. Dan Franklin, associate publisher at Jonathan Cape – who has worked with authors including Salman Rushdie and Martin Amis – admitted that though prize-winning potential was not “a large factor” in his editors’ decisions to publish novels “I’m guessing it’s always at the back of an editor’s mind”. Prizes, he added, had become more significant as it had become harder to publicise literary novels, due to the decline in review coverage by mass-media outlets. Novelist Jane Harris said that when her debut novel The Observations was shortlisted for the Orange prize, this propelled her sales and subsequent career. “Prizes sell books,” she said. Her second novel, Gillespie and I, was longlisted for the same prize, which has since changed its name to that of its new sponsor Baileys. She added: “The main difference in getting a book on to a prize list is in terms of sales. The Orange was a tremendous boost for both my books.” Alex Wheatle, winner of the Guardian children’s fiction prize, said the impact on his career had been significant. “Even the longlisting of Crongton Knights for the prize brought me to the attention of critics and readers who had never read or considered my work before.” The Sellout, Paul Beatty’s Man Booker-winning novel, had sold only a few thousand copies before the prize, but sales topped 23,000 in the week before Christmas, according to his publisher Oneworld. Beatty’s publisher Juliet Mabey said prizes were now essential in order for independent publishers of literary fiction to be heard above the noise of books by well-known names backed by conglomerates. “The attention prize judges pay to books which might otherwise go under the literary radar is critical,” she said. “For literary fiction, a prize nod can make all the difference. A novel that might only sell 2,000 copies could sell 500,000 if it wins the Baileys women’s prize for fiction or the Man Booker prize.” The category winners of the Costas are announced on 3 January. The five finalists, covering children’s, poetry, debut fiction, novel and biography, will each receive £5,000 and go into contention for the overall award, which will be revealed on 31 January.','https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/02/on-eve-of-costa-awards-experts-warn-that-top-books-prizes-are-harming-fiction','On eve of Costa awards, experts warn that top books prizes are harming fiction',268,'books'),('business/2017/jan/02/bhs-liquidator-property-deal-investigation-green-chappell','The liquidators of BHS are conducting a detailed investigation into property transactions that took place during the regimes of Sir Philip Green and Dominic Chappell, including whether the directors of the retailer breached their duties. Insolvency practitioners have a legal duty to review the conduct of the directors of a collapsed company, but the scope and depth of the BHS investigation is rare. FRP Advisory is undertaking a “massive exercise in data collation”, according to one source close to the winding up of BHS. BHS collapsed into administration last April, leading to the loss of 11,000 jobs and leaving a £571m pension deficit. A parliamentary investigation into the failure of the department store chain concluded that it had been systematically plundered under the ownership of Green and Chappell. Green owned BHS for 15 years until he sold it to Chappell, a former bankrupt, for £1. During his ownership, the Green family and other shareholders collected at least £580m from BHS in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans. Chappell’s company, Retail Acquisitions, received payments of up to £25m from BHS despite owning the department store chain for just 13 months until it collapsed. The parliamentary committee that investigated BHS questioned Green and Chappell about a series of property deals. Green was criticised over the sale by Arcadia, his retail business, of BHS’s shop in Ealing, west London, to a company run by his stepson less than a week before BHS was sold to Chappell. Brett Palos, who also appeared before MPs during their inquiry, bought the store for £6.9m through his company Thackeray Estates, then sold it for a £3m profit three months later. Chappell also sold BHS’s main warehouse in Atherstone, Warwickshire, for £15m to a company that has one of his friends, Mahmood Ismailjee, as a director. Green told MPs he was not involved the Ealing transaction and that the company had valued the property before selling it. Chappell has insisted he acted properly as a director throughout his tenure at BHS. Under corporate law, directors have a duty not to sell assets at an undervalue if a business is at risk of collapse. If a director is found to have breached this duty, he is at risk of being disqualified by the Insolvency Service. Liquidators can apply to the court to reverse a transaction at an undervalue if it occurred within two years of the insolvency. A spokesman for FRP said: “We will be continuing our process of making recoveries through liquidation on behalf of all creditors and continuing with our statutory duties.” However, the firm revealed more details about its work in a progress report sent to creditors of BHS at the end of November, just before the retailer moved from administration. FRP said: “The concurrent administrators [FRP] have commenced their enquiries into a number of historic matters of concern and key transactions, including those raised by the parliamentary enquiry into the company’s failure, and they are working with their legal advisers, Jones Day, to determine appropriate avenues of further investigation. “It would not be appropriate to comment in detail on the nature and level of the concurrent administrators’ investigations at this juncture. However, within the parameters of the court order, these have included a review of the possible claims and challenges available to an insolvency office holder pursuant to the Companies Act 2006 and Insolvency Act 1986, including those relating to antecedent transactions and wrongful trading.” FRP was brought in to be the joint administrator to BHS with Duff &amp; Phelps – then the sole liquidator – by the Pension Protection fund, the biggest creditor. Green, who spent Christmas and new year in Florida, remains in talks with the Pensions Regulator about a settlement for the BHS pension scheme. He has until March to reach a deal before the regulator moves to the next stage of its legal proceedings against him. Chappell said the period since BHS collapsed had been “extremely difficult” and that Retail Acquisitions did “everything we possibly could” to save the retailer. “Everybody has been under very close scrutiny,” he said. “We have complied with every regulatory body, of which there is five we have been dealing with. We have been open and frank with them right the way through and living up to our fiduciary care as directors of a business that has failed. “As it has been stated, we took huge amounts of legal advice right the way through, from the start to the finish of BHS. We complied with every single thing that we needed to do as directors and at no stage did we trade immorally.”','https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/02/bhs-liquidator-property-deal-investigation-green-chappell','BHS liquidator pores over details of   Green and Chappell property deals',269,'business'),('commentisfree/2017/jan/02/japanese-husband-speak-wife-abuse-coercive-control','Since in 2016 turning on the news invariably resulted in a rush of negativity, it’s fair to say that by 31 December we were all fed up with the prevailing sense of doom. This perhaps explains why a story – the authenticity of which has been questioned – about a Japanese husband who didn’t speak to his wife for 20 years was reported as a bizarre-yet-comical, and ultimately cheery, item. Better that than to see it as an example of coercive control, something violence against women’s charities have been highlighting for decades. Last December, ironically rather close to the dawn of the year just gone, some types of controlling domestic abuse became a crime in the UK, punishable by up to five years’ imprisonment. For many though, their understanding of “domestic violence” remains limited to its physical manifestations. Thus, the Daily Mail and the Sun are happy to report on what they are saying is a true story of a father-of-three from Nara in southern Japan, who has continued to live with his wife despite only ever responding to her attempts at conversation with a nod or grunt. That this might be less a comedy and more a peep into how coercive control operates isn’t dwelled upon in these articles. The drive to cover it at all is based on this being viewed as a strange but harmless story of the ups and downs inherent in marriage. Nowhere is time given to ponder what, if this story is genuine, would be the grim reality for a woman who was treated like this. Neither is there consideration of what levels of emotional resilience had been worn away to make her remain with a man who grunted responses to her despite them raising an 18-, 21- and 25-year-old. Or to consider the emotional impact of the children seeing their father demean their mother in such a way. The story is instead presented under the jokey headline The Incredible Sulk, without understanding the irony of this pun, with its allusions to explosive rage and violence, and relying on tired gendered stereotypes of the miserable husband and long-suffering wife. The Mail’s take on the story (a version one commentator believes is an example of fake news and poor fact checking), has been shared 17,000 times. If anyone cares to they can watch the couple meeting and talking at the place where it’s said that they had their first date. Footage comes courtesy of the TV show their 18-year-old son had written into, telling of how he had never heard his parents in conversation together. As is typical, the wife is blamed for the abuse she has suffered, while her husband admits that he was “jealous” that she was “very involved and busy in raising the kids”. Laughter can be heard when the husband says he intends to speak to his wife after their filmed reconciliation, to which she says she is “grateful”. Again – the urge to see the funny side of things. Reporting like this, which fails to acknowledge the humiliation this woman may have suffered, or to accept that the jealousy that fuelled the sulk is not a sign of love but an example of coercive control, shows how far we have yet to go in publicising the complexities of domestic violence. Psychological coercion is central to how an abuser maintains their power and yet there persists the focus on physical violence. Trying to turn a story that should make us question the intricacies and impact of such behaviour into a light news item merely perpetuates the problem. It means that the impact on a person who is in a relationship that is emotionally and physically threatening is minimised. And under such conditions it is far easier to believe survivors are catastrophising their perception of reality. These are the types of arguments perpetrators make to those who they are abusing in order to justify their abuse. It is an effective tool for silencing victims. Coercive control is, thankfully, now on the radar. Last year’s domestic violence storyline on The Archers made listeners aware that it is more complicated than looking out for bruises, and a wider understanding of the issue can only be a good thing. Yet simplistic assessments of domestic violence situations which see the only problem as the woman’s unwillingness to “just leave” continue to fail victims. Instead what is needed is greater appreciation of how coercive control works. That, I’m afraid, is not cheery news but it will go some way towards helping those suffering to be seen and heard.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/02/japanese-husband-speak-wife-abuse-coercive-control','A man who didn’t talk to his wife would not be funny.

Featuring a bloodhound, a harrowing death scene, a motherless baby, an animal howl of anguish from Martin Freeman as Watson, and the great detective blinking away what would have been a tear in the eye of anyone less cold blooded than Benedict Cumberbatch’s Holmes, the programme took just under a third – 32.8% – of the viewing audience. It became the second most popular programme of the festive period, beaten only by the New Year’s Eve countdown and midnight fireworks, which got 11.6 million viewers. It was also slightly down on last year’s Sherlock special, The Abominable Bride, which had 8.4 million viewers and went on to win two Emmy awards for the best television drama, and sold to 216 international broadcasters, the corporation’s biggest export success. This time Sherlock beat the Queen, though her Christmas message was the most popular programme of Christmas Day, watched by 7.7 million, recorded before she caught the bad cold which has kept her out of the public gaze for the entire festive season. The Six Thatchers, Sunday’s opener in what may be the last Sherlock series due to the increasing commitments elsewhere of both its stars, left the Brown family trailing in its wake: the Mrs Brown’s Boys New Year special, the BBC’s second most popular offering, which attracted just 6.7 million viewers – though almost precisely the same audience share, presumably as many viewers took their hangovers to bed. At a preview screening, co-creator Mark Gatiss warned that the new three-part series of Sherlock could be the last. “We would love to do more, but we are not lying, we absolutely don’t know. It’s up to all kinds of factors, scheduling. Willingness to do it is all here, but we are just not sure.” Both lead actors have become international stars since Sherlock, based on updated versions of the classic Sir Arthur Conan Doyle stories, began in 2010. Cumberbatch played the hero in Marvel’s Doctor Strange this year, and is due to appear in at least two more films in the series. Freeman starred in The Hobbit films, and in the Fargo television series.','https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/02/sherlock-tops-new-years-day-tv-ratings-81m-viewers-bbc','Sherlock tops New Year’s Day TV ratings with 8.1m viewers',272,'media'),('uk-news/2017/jan/02/couple-missing-in-cairngorms-found-safe-and-well','A couple and their dog who spent the night in freezing conditions on a Scottish mountain range have been found safe and well by rescue teams. The man and woman, aged 59 and 56, and their collie dog got lost in the Cairngorms after bad weather closed in on them during a New Year’s Day walk. They were were forced to spend the night high up in blizzard conditions as temperatures dropped to -20C (-4F). Rescuers said they survived by sheltering in a bivouac sack, or bivvy bag. The Cairngorm mountain rescue team (CMRT) started searching on Sunday evening after the couple failed to return to their campsite. But rescuers could find no trace of the pair, thought to be from England. Six members of the team braved severe conditions to search through the night without success. In the morning they were joined by around 50 people including specialists from Police Scotland, the Royal Air Force mountain rescue team, Braemar mountain rescue team and the coastguard helicopter. CMRT’s leader, Willie Anderson, said the couple were found a few hundred feet below a 1244-metre (4084ft) summit and were very cold. “They misjudged how long their walk would take them yesterday and then the cloud closed in and it started snowing. “They were a bit disorientated but at least they had a bivvy bag to shelter them. That probably saved their lives.” Anderson said the pair had tried to find a way off the mountain but were disorientated when a fierce blizzard blew in. “It was probably -20C with the wind chill … They were experienced walkers and had gone for a day out with their dog but after they failed to return it became a very concerning situation,” he said. He said the wind reached 30mph at times, and praised the rescue team who continued to search the mountain throughout the night, braving “atrocious conditions.” “It was blizzard conditions at times … It was pretty horrendous weather. We are just very pleased to have had a successful outcome. You can be an experienced walker but you may have never experienced Cairngorm weather before – and that can catch anybody out.” The couple were found just after midday. Rescuers walked them to a track vehicle because poor visibility meant it was not safe to use a helicopter. They were then driven to the funicular railway and taken off the mountain. The pair were checked over by medics and found to be safe and well. The Mountaineering Council of Scotland says extra care is needed before tackling Scottish mountains in the winter with shorter days and adverse weather conditions requiring extra preparation. It gives a 10-point safety checklist which includes making sure people have all the right kit including head torches and bivvy bags or emergency survival bags. It also states that people should carry extra clothes and equipment to help them survive if they get stuck on the high peaks after dark.','https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/02/couple-missing-in-cairngorms-found-safe-and-well','\'The bivvy bag probably saved their lives\': couple lost in Cairngorms found safe',273,'uk-news'),('books/booksblog/2017/jan/02/poem-of-the-week-italy-to-lord-by-jane-draycott','Italy to Lord It’s dark in here and forest green: Britannica, sixteen oak trees in a London living room, the little girl, my mother, in the bookcase glass. Italy, Ithaca, Izmail, Japan, each page a mainsail, turning, HMS Discovery – none of the rivers of southern Italy is of any great importance. Like birds on a long-haul flight, let not seas or deserts, cliffs or icy mountain-tops impede you. Jews, Kabȋr, Kabul, Kaffir, from up here all seems clear (all evil in the world’s ascribed to Maya or illusion), then home at last returned from all those navigable miles to Lichen, Linnet, Logic, London, to find a century has passed, the forest’s cleared, the animals all bared and scorched, the gold all brought to light. I look into the glass, discover there myself in dense shade, deep and shadowy as on any wooded island. Italy to Lord, the first poem in Jane Draycott’s new collection, The Occupant, makes an apt overture. Fulfilling one of its own metaphors, in which “each page” of the Encyclopaedia Britannica becomes “a mainsail, / turning, HMS Discovery”, Italy to Lord anticipates the lexical adventure of the whole poetry collection. The pleasure of word-led circumnavigation is a subject to which writers are naturally drawn. Draycott, though, has found a refreshingly individual approach. Her ultimate emotional focus is a significant human person, “the little girl, my mother”, imagined almost spectrally in the mysterious dimness of the bookcase glass. Distant, nameless among the many names, the child may be playing or hovering near the bookcase, too young to read, or read beyond the lettering on the spines, but attracted nonetheless by atmosphere and ambience. This Alice in Wonderland-ish world resembles a deep forest, distinguished by the “sixteen oak trees” of the (incomplete?) set of encyclopaedias. The metaphorical transformation may not be wholly dependent on verbal stimuli, but it sets the scene of linguistic empowerment. We’ll meet the speaker in a similar setting at the end of the poem. Typography is an important factor. The listed entry words – “Italy, Ithaca, Izmail, Japan”, for instance, in line four – are not in bold or italic type and, as a result, they lose the anorexic look of the signifier to fill out with meaning. It’s up to the reader to supply the meanings and associations, though the choices provide clues: each of us, to some extent, is his or her own lexicographer. At the same time, because of the randomness imparted by alphabetical ordering, we are permitted to read as innocently as the seven-year-old for whom the new place-name, Ithaca, might feel exciting and potent even without any Homeric associations. The first piece of information quoted by the poem seems dismissive and its positioning may be ironical: “none of the rivers / of southern Italy is of any great importance.” In both quotations, the combination of formal grammar, italics and good old-fashioned assertiveness suggest a somewhat dated historical context, and an awareness that facts can be styles of knowing, subject to change. The second stanza utters a prayer, primarily for the child but perhaps for the speaker and reader, too. Its wish – that there should be no more of an impediment to the mental flight than there is to birds migrating across difficult terrain – is embodied in the quartet of entry words, “Jews, Kabir, Kabul, Kaffir”. India itself does not qualify alphabetically for an entry, but the quotation about Maya bridging lines four and five may relate to the entry on Kabȋr. Kabȋr was a radical mystic who sought to combine Muslim and Hindu belief systems. Conversely, political and religious brutality simmers in such words as “Kabul” and “Kaffir”: the word “Jews” is an expanding universe of historical complexity. But Draycott’s intensely packed short-list seems to invoke neutrality and suppress dissent. It’s almost as if the value of the encyclopaedia were perceived as a moral one, expressed in the democracy of the alphabet and the impartiality of the definitions. There’s no break in the sense between stanzas two and three. The syntax curves elegantly to the home stretch of “Lichen, Linnet, Logic, London”. (The child has already been located to “a London living room”.) But, as we now discover, the journey has crossed time as well as space, and a century has passed. There is a different face in the glass. The “little girl” grew up long ago and, glancingly, the poem has become her elegy. Fine brush strokes summarise the depradations: “the forest’s cleared, / the animals all bared and scorched, the gold / all brought to light”. The quick shock of those passive verbs “bared and scorched” conveys ecological devastation; the reference to the gold resonates as exploitation rather than discovery. But these metaphors transpose beautifully to the domestic sphere. A family home has been cleaned out of all its treasures. The bookcase has suffered deforestation. Poetic imagination recovers itself in that Marvellian location, “dense shade”. A new figure, probably that of the poet-daughter, hovers in the glass, a circularity that recalls the etymology of the word “encyclopedia”. The poem’s last phrase, “as on any wooded island”, is ambiguous: it need not imply any real wooded island. Yet, for post-EU referendum readers, the phrase may conjure an enchantment tinged with warning. Since the Earth-loving sage and poet Kabîr qualifies as the genius loci of Draycott’s gentle, subtle and generous poem, I’ll give him the last word: The jewel is lost in the mud, and all are seeking for it; Some look for it in the east, and some in the west; some in the water and some amongst stones. But the servant Kabîr has appraised it at its true value, and has wrapped it with care in the end of the mantle of his heart.

The union representing Harrods waiters and kitchen staff believes the Qatari owner of the upmarket London department store retains up to 75% of the service charge, a situation it says reduces their pay by up to £5,000 a year. The United Voices of the World union (UVW) says an unspecified percentage of the service charge collected at Harrods’ 16 cafes and restaurants is shared among the 483 kitchen and waiting staff. It is organising a demonstration outside the Knightsbridge department store on Saturday as part of a call for greater transparency. A Harrods spokeswoman confirmed that, like many businesses in the hospitality sector, the company operated a “tronc” system, whereby the service charge is shared out. “Harrods is taking steps to improve the current system through which it distributes its service charge, to ensure it best serves our employees and is completing a detailed review into the existing scheme,” she said. “As this is an ongoing review, we are unable to provide further details on the distribution. However, employees will be informed of the details of the new system as soon as the review is complete.” Petros Elia, the UVW general secretary, said: “Customers expect the service charge to go to staff and that’s where it should go. If Harrods feels the need to retain a percentage they should explain why.” What happens to the cash generated by the service charge applied to bar and restaurant bills has become a moot point. The TV chef Michel Roux Jr admitted in December that his Michelin-starred restaurant Le Gavroche classed service charge income as revenue rather than tips to be shared among staff. He has since said the restaurant would scrap the charge from the end of January. The chef also apologised following a Guardian report in November which revealed that Roux was paying some of his staff less than the minimum wage at his Mayfair restaurant, where the menu includes starters costing as much as £62.80 for lobster mousse with caviar and champagne sauce. Fortnum &amp; Mason, another high-end London department store, is also trying to persuade staff at its Heathrow bar to move over to a tronc system.Fortnum &amp; Mason does not currently distribute any of the 12.5% service charge collected on drinkers’ bills at Heathrow. Accounts filed at Companies House show that Harrods’ owner, Qatar Holding – the investment arm of the country’s sovereign wealth fund that acquired the store from Mohamed Al Fayed in 2010 for an estimated £1.5bn – paid itself a £100.1m dividend in 2016. That followed a record year in which pre-tax profits increased 19% to £168m. Sales rose 4% to £1.4bn in the year to 30 January 2016. The highest-paid director, presumed to be its managing director, Michael Ward, earned £1.6m. The retailer attracts high-spending overseas tourists and Ward told the Guardian that it had been insulated from the economic gloom emerging in the UK since the Brexit vote. “Christmas has been particularly strong this year,” he said, pointing to solid demand for bags, shoes and diamonds, with Yves Saint Laurent and Gucci among the most popular brands. “The top end of the market is always less affected than anyone else … from our perspective we’ve got great local customers plus we’ve seen more international customers come to London.” Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority, was founded in 2005 to help the Gulf state strengthen its economy by investing its oil and gas riches in other assets. This article was amended on 4 January 2017. The original said the service charge is shared out, but only if staff accept a cut in basic pay. This has been corrected.','https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/02/harrods-service-charge-workers-company-keeps-restaurant-tips','Harrods workers say company keeps up to 75% of restaurant service charge',275,'business'),('world/2017/jan/02/french-trial-teodorin-obiang-wealth-equatorial-guinea','The days of the Bugattis, the chateau Pétrus and the fine Parisian restaurants may be over for Teodorin Obiang – at least in western Europe. The son of Equatorial Guinea’s leader is due to go on trial for corruption and money laundering in a landmark case in France. Obiang, the 47-year-old vice-president of the oil-rich but impoverished African country, faces an array of legal cases across Europe as authorities on the continent investigate the sources of his vast wealth and uncover new and even more extravagant ways that he spent some of it. US officials have already forced Obiang to forfeit property after accusing him of “shamelessly” looting his country. In a settlement, Obiang agreed to hand over more than $30m (£24.5m) worth of properties, including a vast villa in Malibu, California, and a dozen luxury cars. Obiang, however, managed to keep his $38m private jet and collection of Michael Jackson memorabilia, which includes a crystal-studded glove. In Europe, Dutch, Swiss and French authorities have seized property including Obiang’s 76-metre yacht, the Ebony Shine, and a mansion in Paris estimated to be worth $200m. The mansion includes a cinema, spa, hair salon and sports room. Bathroom taps were covered in gold leaf while original paintings by Degas and Renoir hung on the walls. Cars seized in Geneva included a Swedish-manufactured vehicle worth $2.8m and a $2m Bugatti Veyron. French prosecutors allege that Obiang plundered nearly $115m between 2004-11 when he was agriculture minister for his father, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, who has been in power since 1979. The post gave Obiang control over the lucrative timber industry. Proceeds from a so-called revolutionary tax imposed on wood sales was transferred to his personal accounts, prosecutors allege. In court on Monday, one of Obiang’s lawyers asked for the trial be suspended on the grounds that his client had not been given enough time to properly prepare his defence, having been summoned to trial just three weeks ago. “We’re not talking about a moped theft charge,” Emmanuel Marsigny told Reuters. The trial marks a major shift for France, which has long turned a blind eye to corrupt African dictators buying Parisian real estate, enjoying spending sprees in the capital or on the Coôte d’Azur, or simply fleeing to the country when in difficulty. The policy was seen as part of a wider attempt by France to maintain influence in former colonies, but also in Africa. Equatorial Guinea is a former Spanish colony. The change is in part due to evolving popular and political values, greater media scrutiny at home and abroad, and nearly a decade of lobbying by anti-corruption campaigners. “In the beginning, there was simply no political will in France to listen to us,” wrote one of the campaigners, William Bourdon from the Sherpa group, in September. The move by Swiss authorities also indicates a tougher stance, observers say. Obiang is expected to plead not guilty in the Paris court to charges of laundering the proceeds of corruption, embezzlement and misuse of public funds. He has “always said he earned the money legally in his country”, Marsigny told Agence France-Presse news agency. The defendant, who has failed with previous legal efforts to stop the trial, is not expected to attend or serve any sentence if he is convicted. Campaigners say the case will set an important precedent and has cost Obiang’s father diplomatic capital in the region. Now the longest-serving African ruler, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo made his son vice-president in June just after being re-elected with his usual score of more than 90% of votes cast. Born in 1969, Obiang was 10 when his father overthrew his bloodthirsty uncle, the dictator Francisco Macías Nguema. He has denied all wrongdoing and, during one of his appeals against the French trial, a lawyer acting for the French government said his client had a “compulsive need to buy”. Obiang is known to have bought a crystal-covered glove worn by Michael Jackson during his Bad tour, which is worth hundreds of thousands of euros. Its whereabouts are unclear. The US justice department said he “embarked on a corruption-fuelled spending spree in the United States” after racking up $300m through embezzlement, extortion and money laundering. Equatorial Guinea is regularly criticised by human rights groups for its repressive laws, unlawful killings, use of torture and corruption. In December, Obiang’s lawyers failed to convince the international court of justice that he had diplomatic immunity and so had no case to answer in France. Obiang has denied ownership of the luxury yacht seized by Dutch authorities, claiming it belonged to his country’s government. According to specialist media, Obiang has another yacht, worth even more, in Tangier, Morocco. The life expectancy in Equatorial Guinea, Africa’s third largest oil producer, is 57 years for men and 60 for women, one of the lowest levels in the world.','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/02/french-trial-teodorin-obiang-wealth-equatorial-guinea','French trial reveals vast wealth of Equatorial Guinean president\'s son',276,'world'),('tv-and-radio/2017/jan/02/deddie-davies-obituary','Deddie Davies, who has died of ovarian cancer aged 78, will be remembered as Nell, wife of the station porter Mr Perks, in The Railway Children, the director Lionel Jeffries’s lovingly made 1970 film adaptation of Edith Nesbit’s Edwardian novel. The character brings the three children – played by Jenny Agutter, Sally Thomsett and Gary Warren – into Perks’s home life, away from the railway station where they have their adventures. “It’s a birthday such as Perks never had, not even when he were a boy,” she tells them on seeing the gifts they have collected from villagers. When Perks (Bernard Cribbins) insists he will not accept charity, Mrs Perks looks on fretfully as they persuade him that the presents were donated with kindness and respect. Usually to be seen with a wide smile, the 5ft 1in, bird-like actor subsequently brought her skills as a character player to the supporting casts of sitcoms over five decades – with timid, tearful and prim parts in sharp contrast to her own focused personality, which was augmented by a wicked sense of humour. She was born Gillian Davies in Bridgend, Glamorgan, to Dolly (nee Shufflebotham), who ran her family’s business distributing and retailing china and giftware, and Llewelyn, a bank cashier. She had a half-sister, Norah, the daughter of her father’s first wife, who died of polio. Davies’s passion for acting was demonstrated in plays at Howells school, Llandaff. She trained at Rada and, because another actor was called Gillian Davies, changed her name to Deddie – the nickname she had acquired because of her dedication to acting. Rep seasons followed in Exeter, Richmond upon Thames and Manchester. In Colchester, she acted alongside Paddy Ward, whom she married in 1966. He was seen with her in several television productions and two films, driving the cart taking the Waterbury family to their new home in The Railway Children and as a bus driver in The Amazing Mr Blunden (1972 ), in which she played the servant Meakin. In the West End, they were on stage together in Toad of Toad Hall (Duke of York’s theatre, 1970). Davies’s television career began with parts in period dramas – Millie in The Forsyte Saga (1967) and Lady Crawley in Vanity Fair (1967) – but casting directors saw her talent for comedy when she played the town tittle-tattle Madame Fouache in Clochemerle (1972), Ray Galton and Alan Simpson’s nine-part adaptation of a 1934 French satirical novel. A string of comedy roles followed, starting in two workplace sitcoms – as Flo, one of Dora Bryan’s fellow factory employees at Cannon’s Family Sausages, in Both Ends Meet (1972) and Mabel, in Fenner Fashions’ dressmaking workshop, in the 1977-78 remake of The Rag Trade. Then came Sister Mary in Father Charlie (1982); the music teacher Miss Coombes in AJ Wentworth, BA (1982); the doctor’s surgery receptionist Miss Parfitt in the last two series (1985-86) of That’s My Boy; Mrs Little, trying to convince her daughter (Brenda Blethyn) that her fiance (Simon Callow) was not the man for her, in Chance in a Million (1984-86); and Miss Bamber, one of the advertising agency staff, in My Husband and I (1987-88). In the 1990s she was Sister Sheila in the final three runs (1992-94) of Waiting for God and Auntie Dot in the pilot Outside Chance (1993) and Time After Time (1994-95). Davies showed her versatility when she switched to soaps and took five parts in The Bill (1991-2007) and four in Doctors (2004-11). Her roles in costume dramas included Nancy in The Mayor of Casterbridge (1978), Mrs Cluppins in The Pickwick Papers (1985) and Aunt Caroline in The Canterville Ghost (1986). She was also a favourite in children’s programmes, playing Mad Meg in The Black Arrow (1974-75), Mrs Wigson in The Phoenix and the Carpet (1977), Miss Fairman in Just William (1977) and Agnes Bell in Bernard’s Watch (2001). Film roles were rare, but her last was in Pride (2014) as a bingo lover in a South Wales miners’ welfare hall where lesbian and gay activists bring money raised for them during the 1984-85 strike. “Listen, love,” she tells one. “I don’t care if you’re Arthur Scargill. Don’t talk during the bingo.” Davies was also back in the valleys of her childhood to play the donkey owner Marj Brennig in Ruth Jones and David Peet’s comedy-drama Stella (2012-16), set in the fictional Pontyberry. Off screen, she brought the same passion she had for acting to her charity work campaigning for elderly people. In 2007, as one of the Zimmers – billed as “the world’s oldest rock band” – she helped to highlight their isolation by recording the Who song My Generation, which became a Top 30 hit. A year later, Davies – a trustee of Compassion in Care – investigated the quality of life in care homes for BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. She spent five days in a home, in the role of the reporter Jon Manel’s aunt, and kept an audio-diary of her experiences in cold rooms, with residents sitting in a TV lounge between their very basic meals, left alone for long periods, and, in the case of the bedridden, without company or conversation. “I do think [the residents’] quality of life could be better with just a little bit more effort,” she said.“It wouldn’t take much more money but it just needs a greater vision of what it’s like to be completely helpless.” Davies and her husband remained ardent theatregoers. He died in 2011. • Deddie Davies (Gillian Nancy Davies), actor, born 2 March 1938; died 21 December 2016','https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/02/deddie-davies-obituary','Deddie Davies obituary',277,'tv-and-radio'),('commentisfree/2017/jan/02/new-year-that-changed-me-weed-book-addict-spliff','As my mother was a Jehovah’s Witness, my childhood was devoid of all the usual opportunities for merrymaking. Celebrations were considered pagan, so we had nothing to look forward to all year – no presents, cards, tinsel or sparklers, no Christmas, birthdays, Easter, Bonfire night, Mother’s Day, Halloween, Valentine’s Day, solstices or Pancake Day. But somehow, on New Year’s Eve, under my father’s influence, we were allowed a thimbleful of cherry brandy and arm’s-length participation in the heart-thumping Big Ben countdown, when the old year made way for the new and we were all born again. I left home in 1976 at 16 and moved from bedsit to bedsit in the cool student-land of Birmingham, where I brushed up against music and drugs, art and protest and debate. Although I never quite got around to a Christmas tree, I did learn how to celebrate my birthday – three days and nights with some sticky Lebanese hash and a bottle of Thunderbird. I would temp for a few months or pose at the local art college as a life model, get some money together and spend the rest of the year on the dole, going to gigs and parties and festivals, stoned, half-smashed or both. I wouldn’t have admitted it then, but a lifetime of indoctrination had done its job and I believed that Armageddon was all but nigh. At any minute, the vengeful Jehovah would destroy the drug-taking fornicators with foul mouths and morals to suit. If there was a sin I hadn’t committed, I had to get on and sample it. Might as well be hanged for a sheep … Hence, by New Year’s Eve 1980, I’d been going at it pretty hard. I was at a party in a Victorian mansion in Moseley. The house was full of bedsits with damp armchairs and splintered floorboards. Every door was open, every wall had people slouched against it two-deep, weed-fog wafting from room to room, music rattling our bones and the sash windows. I found a perch at the top of the stairs to smoke my four-paper trumpet spliff and wait for midnight. I don’t remember the name of the girl who sat next to me, but she was wearing the shiny red lipstick of the brave and beautiful. She had a sort of Cleopatra hairstyle and a black jumper that had slipped from one shoulder. I offered her my joint and we smoked together, talking about a mutual friend who had killed himself under the influence of magic mushrooms and another who had been sectioned after repeated psychotic episodes. After my own terrifying bouts of near madness and paranoia, I suspected it might be time to go easy on the ganja. “I should give this up,” I said, taking a hard drag and breathing as little as possible to keep the vital smoke inside for as long as possible. She looked at me for a long time. “You? Never.” “Could if I wanted to,” I replied. “No,” she said. “Tell you what,” I said. “Bet you I don’t have another thing after the stroke of midnight.” She shook her head, passed me the spliff back and I sucked it&nbsp;down. Partly it was her disbelief. Partly it was my stubbornness. Partly it was just the right time. At midnight, at the last gong, I stopped taking drugs. I took a job in a solicitor’s office, but that only used up the daytime; there were long nights to get through and I needed an alternative form of recreation. I don’t know why I turned to reading: maybe it was the woman next to me on the bus who was so engrossed in her book that she missed her stop; maybe it was memories of Bible stories and the poetic beauty of the Song of Solomon. But one day I asked my boss for a list of the 10 best books he’d ever read. I picked the first two off the shelf at Dillons and devoured them like spliffs. I finished his list in a few weeks and then worked my way through Dickens and Thackeray, George Eliot, the Brontës and all the usual suspects at the rate of about two each week, sometimes more. Addicted by then, I continued through the centuries to Evelyn Waugh, Somerset Maugham, Graham Greene and on and on into France and America, Germany and Ireland. I’ve never regretted the wild years, but I’m glad I stopped when I did that New Year’s Eve. My immersion in reading has been an education of sorts. Certainly I absorbed notions of the craft of good writing, found seams of literature that spoke to me and which I’ve since mined again and again, discovering along the way my own voice and the world I want to write about.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/02/new-year-that-changed-me-weed-book-addict-spliff','A new year that changed me: I gave up weed – and became a book addict instead | Kit de Waal',278,'commentisfree'),('football/2017/jan/02/middlesbrough-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report','While 2016 was a year to remember for Leicester City and Middlesbrough, much work is still to be done if 2017 does not turn into an almighty dud. Neither side deserved to win this scrap of a Premier League match, with the goalkeepers barely having a save to make and the result not exactly helping either team’s bid to move up the table. Perhaps it was not surprising this was not a free-flowing affair, given Boro and Leicester have scored a combined 41 league goals, a figure equalled or bettered individually by Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal. The result still keeps both teams comfortably above the bottom three but Claudio Ranieri and Aitor Karanka may need to improve the attacking potency in order to move further away from danger. Boro are in negotiations to sign Aston Villa’s Rudy Gestede but Karanka would not be drawn on the mooted deal. The only real moment of controversy came in the first half when Adama Traoré felt he deserved a penalty after going down under the challenge of Robert Huth. The admirable defender said afterwards “we got lucky” but Ranieri’s response was more to the point, the Leicester manager saying: “If that is a penalty, I’m the pope.” Both sides made five changes from their matches on New Year’s Eve and the first half was a fragmented one as a result. Leicester offered little width while Boro often found themselves in strong attacking positions only to be let down by the end product. The champions held a two-point advantage over Middlesbrough before kick-off and Karanka spoke beforehand of the importance of the match because it came against a relegation rival. Leicester’s two points from nine away games before this match on Monday is the joint lowest total by defending top-flight champions but they have enjoyed a far superior record over Boro in recent times, not losing in their past 13 meetings. Leicester started well, with Shinji Okazaki causing problems with his usual injection of energy and a persevering run from the Japan forward saw the ball at the feet of Christian Fuchs on the left-hand edge of the penalty area but the full-back dragged his shot wide. For Boro, their best outlet was Traoré who continues his season of wonderful runs and woeful crossing. On more than one occasion the Spaniard beat his man down the right before failing to deliver a telling ball but he was certainly Middlesbrough’s most dangerous threat. In the 18th minute Traoré went down on the edge of the area with the referee, Robert Madley, giving nothing, before setting up his team’s best chance of the half moments later. Traoré drove to the byline and squared the ball across goal for Marten de Roon, but the midfielder could fire only over the crossbar with his first-time effort. Both sides struggled to create clear scoring opportunities, although Leicester’s Andy King and Boro’s George Friend – on for the injured Antonio Barragán – both fizzed enticing balls across the box only to evade onrushing team-mates. Of his side’s lack of goals this season, and the interest in Gestede, Karanka said: “I think the main thing for scoring goals is creating chances, and we are creating chances. “Two weeks ago against Swansea we scored three, we couldn’t score today but my head is with the players we have now because all of them are doing a really good job. I want to finish the transfer market with a better squad than we have now. “It was a good result for us, I’m really pleased with the performance. We saw when we played away we were better then them [Leicester] and we showed today we are better than them.” Friend had at least made an impact for Karanka’s side and the full-back cut inside from the left in the 68th minute, beat two defenders before slicing wide. Leicester came close when Leonardo Ulloa headed a corner straight at Brad Guzan, but the game was descending into a low-grade affair. Gaston Ramírez went close to snatching a late goal, firing a low shot into the side netting after a poor headed clearance from Wes Morgan, but no one deserved to win this match. Ranieri said: “The performance was good, a good spirit. We got one point and a second clean sheet in a row, it was good for us. Middlesbrough pushed a lot but were only dangerous on two or three crosses. We were so solid, I’m pleased with the spirit we showed. “This season we have conceded so many goals, we had to improve. We have gone back to being solid and strong with a good personality.”','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/02/middlesbrough-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report','Middlesbrough fail to scale Robert Huth’s Leicester battlements',279,'football'),('football/live/2017/jan/02/middlesbrough-v-leicester-city-premier-league-live','That was an exercise in existentialism that has robbed me of any thoughts.

Bobby Madley spotted one at last. 90+1 min: A decent break by Leicester results in Albrighton finding Ulloa’s forehead and the ball finding the roof of the net. 90 min: Some wicked deviant has decided that there will be five more minutes of this. 88 min: A series of about 72 sterile Boro passes ends when Fabio hoiks the ball across the Riverside towards Friend on the left and out for a goal-kick. Yup. Leadbitter is on for Forshaw. 85 min: Boro have had 63% possession but created next to nothing. They look solid, of course, but they’ll need to start scoring soon to make sure they avoid being dragged into the filthy business of a relegation scrap. 84 min: Mendy’s day is over. I remember him fouling someone but doing little else. He’s replaced by Albrighton. 81 min: Fabio plays a lazy cross into the box that kicks up in front of Morgan forcing him to head poorly into the path of Ramirez. He’s eight yards out and should score but drags his left-footed shot a foot wide of the right-hand post. That, like this game, was abysmal. Ramirez is such a classy player too. Maybe it was the lactic acid. 80 min: Leicester have a rare attack. It comes to nowt but that’s the first they have had in a long while. 79 min: Traore and his lack of an end product are replaced by Stewart Downing, who has made a career out of lacking an end product. That’s something for Traore to cling to as he skulks off to the bench. 78 min: Musa has been clipped by Clayton and left on the deck holding his ankle. No foul was given. Clayton has got away with a lot in this game. 74 min: A corner for Boro. A clearance by Leicester. Boro are completely in control but Leicester’s defence has hardly been ruffled all game. And I’m not sure Rudy Gestede is what this Boro team needs. They need someone who can run. 72 min: Mahrez and Okazaki have been hauled off by Ranieri and replaced by Gray and Musa. In the meantime, this is by far the most exciting thing that has happened in the past 72 minutes. 70 min: And then Forshaw has an equally fine chance to score for Boro following a beautiful arcing cross from the left from Friend that bends in invitingly and begs the Boro player to nod it home. Instead he reels in his neck and lets it skim off him and fall harmlessly down to Schmeichel. 69 min: Leicester go close to taking the lead after winning a corner after a rare break. The ball is whipped into Ulloa, who can only connect with his shoulder from six yards to send the ball dribbling into Guzan’s arms. 67 min: Friend bundles his way in from the left flank and then drops his shoulder beautifully to send Simpson the wrong way. He sees a sight of goal and tries to bend it into the top corner but can’t get his foot round it. His shot, like this game, is an unlovely sight. 65 min: Boro are still very much on top here but with Negredo misreading the few crosses that have come his way the home side just don’t look like scoring. Leicester are choosing to do nothing. 64 min: There’s a huge roar as Friend and Ulloa clatter into one another in the kind of hefty 50-50 tackle not seen in the top-flight since Lee Cattermole’s hip injury some months ago. That’s how good this game is. 62 min: Friend rolls a lovely ball into the corridor of uncertainty but Negredo, never one to look like he’s in much of a hurry, does a fine impression of Ulloa a minute or two earlier and watches it drift across goal. 60 min: The first 60 minutes of this game has been a visually convincing argument for those in favour of a winter break. 57 min: Fabio decides to inject a bit of dangerous fun into the game and chips over an approaching Leicester player to Traore not far outside his own box. Traore makes a meal of controlling it and Leicester win the ball back much to Karanka’s chagrin. 54 min: Mahrez slides the ball down the left-channel to King who, on the overlap, pings a dangerous ball across the six-yard box that Guzan can’t reach. It needs a poacher to gamble on it. But Leicester don’t have one of those on the pitch today. Both Ulloa and Okazaki hang back and pass up the chance to put their team 1-0 up. 52 min: Leicester are absorbing Boro’s pressure comfortably but when they look primed to break they are sorely lacking Vardy’s pace in attack. When Mahrez gathers the ball he has no one who can break out of a enthusiastic jog ahead of him. 50 min: Traore does a dance and fools no one before hitting the ball against Fuchs. He’s attracting two players over to him now, though. It could be that a switch of play over to the left could undo Leicester if Ranieri’s side become too fixated on Traore’s threatening pace. 49 min: A bright start here from Boro. They win a corner but Ramirez’s ball into the box is cleared at the near post. 47 min: Boro enjoy a good spell of possession and Friend and Ramirez combine well to work the ball down the left flank and then into midfield, where the ball is popped out to Traore. He beats Fuchs for pace (of course) and drifts a better ball into the box. Leicester head it clear and Friend clatters a low shot at goal that Schmeichel gathers into his chest. 45 min: It’s the second half. Leicester win a throw-in on the left. Fuchs Rory Delaps hurls it into the box but Boro clear. If anything good is going to happen in this game it will be as a consequence of something Traore or Mahrez does. For all the lactic acid-affected huff and puff on display among many of the players, those two are the brightest by far. They’re showing a collection of Adama Traore highlights and lowlights. When he beats a man he is so jaw-droppingly quick he gives himself almost too much time to consider his cross. If he had just half a yard he’d have a marker to bend the ball around. He’s actually too fast. If he ever slows down, he’ll be very, very good. He does have a touch of the Tony Daley about him. And if you want to follow the team news and buildup to the 3pm kick-offs, join Barry Glendenning here: There’ll be more of this after the break I’m afraid. In the meantime, if you want excitement, read this … 45 min: Ulloa levers Friend out of the way and then trundles off into a thicket of Boro defenders, soon finding himself lost and without the ball. 44 min: If this first half is a sign of what is to come in 2017, we can expect nothing to happen. Nothing. 42 min: Mahrez starts to flicker to life with a douple-lollipop spritely run at goal that comes to nothing … and then a long-range shot that Guzan saves comfortably. A moment later, he bursts away from Clayton in midfield and Gibson, knowing that Boro’s defence has been left light, cynically clips Mahrez’s feet and takes a booking. 40 min: “Hi Gregg,” writes Kevin Ryan. “Re the 34th minute, I think you’re being a bit hard on Traore, I mean, any clown can pick out one of three of your own blokes in the box but picking out the programme seller. Well …” 38 min: Leicester hoik a long ball forwards. Okazaki takes a wonderful touch and slips Mahrez in down the right channel. He looks primed to strike at goal but Fabio, who has been very impressive so far, slides in brilliantly and hooks the ball away from the Algerian. That was a fantastic tackle. 37 min: Leicester are doing very little to win the ball back and seem entirely happy to let Boro have the ball. When you’re a counter-attacking team playing a side who can’t score it’s not a bad tactic I suppose. 36 min: Ramirez overhits a pass to Friend. Leicester throw-in. Did I say this game could be tasty? Sorry about that. 34 min: Traore in nutshell here. Negredo sends him zooming down the right wing with a delightful backheel. The winger has loads of time to pick out one of three Boro players in the box. Instead, he picks out the programme seller somewhere among the fans behind the goal. Deary me. 32 min: Twang! That’s Barragan’s hamstring. He’ll be replaced by George Friend, who will play at left-back with Fabio switching to the right. Friend has just recovered from a knee injury. 30 min: Boro win a free-kick on the right. Ramirez whips it into the back post, where Negredo peels away and attempts to hook a shot at goal. But athleticism is not his thing and his body kind of stops on the turf instead of sliding and the ball rolls into the side-netting. 29 min: Scrappy. Ugly. Bitty. You could use any of those words to sum up the past two minutes. You can choose. Go on … 27 min: The name Gaston Ramirez is scribbled into Bobby Madley’s little black book after the midfielder indulged in a little bit of filth, tripping Mendy as Leicester looked poised to break. 25 min: Barragan whips a lovely ball into Negredo’s chest. The burly striker takes a touch and tries to lift it over his head to get a shot on goal, but Simpson defends diligently, standing his ground in the face of a lot of muscle. 23 min: Clayton sweeps Mahrez’s legs from under him right on the edge of the Boro box. He could be booked for that (and a couple of other fouls earlier on) but isn’t. King’s curled effort is too central though and gathered easily by Guzan. 22 min: The Boro full-backs Barragan and Fabio have both grown in confidence in the past 10 minutes. They’re helping Boro to work the ball out from the back more comfortably. 20 min: Traore leaves King in his wake and drills a cross to the near-post where De Roon blazes over. It was behind him so it was hard to control but that was yet another example of the threat that Traore carries. 17 min: The Boro fans can sense their side are starting to warm to this game. After a patient spell of possession at the back the ball is worked up to Traore on the right wing. He bursts inside and through a combination of skill and luck he bounces through three challenges to the edge of the box, where he flicks the ball past Huth and tumbles to the floor. Is it a penalty? I think not but the replay was inconclusive. Boro fans think it was, mind. Of course they do. 15 min: Boro just can’t hold on to the ball for any length of time. Two passes and the ball is usually back in the possession of someone in blue. Ramirez pings a lovely ball through the chill Teeside air to Traore on the right wing but his touch is hopeless and the ball goes out for a Leicester throw-in. Traore could be so dangerous when/if he rids himself of these flakes of rust. 13 min: Corner for Leicester. Mahrez to take it. Morgan and Huth are whispering to one another about something. Mahrez’s corner is only marginally better than his free-kick and cleared easily. Maybe they were whispering about Mahrez’s dip in form this season. 11 min: Well, it would have been dangerous had Mahrez not hit a shot that had all the force of a fly’s burp. The ball hits the wall and trundles away. Still, Leicester are comfortably on top now. 9 min: Mahrez dampens the ball with a touch and invites Ramirez to foul him on the edge of the area. Free-kick, central, 25 yards out. this could be very dangerous given Guzan can see bugger all due to the sun. 7 min: Leicester win a free-kick which is lifted towards the back post. Ulloa knocks it down to Okazaki but he can’t shift his feet quick enough to swivel and get a clean strike on goal. Then, a moment later, King finds Fuchs, who fizzes a left-footed shot a foot wide. Better from Leicester. 6 min: Fabio drifts a lovely ball into the left channel for Ramirez but the Urguayan’s touch is heavy and Morgan muscles him out of the way and sees the ball out. 5 min: Barragan and Traore combine on the left to create the first bit of excitement on the game. Traore turns on his afterburners and hares down the line and past Fuchs. But as he gets to the line the ball has just crossed it. Goal-kick, but a warning to the Leicester full-back that he’ll have to strain every muscle to keep up with the winger. 3 min: Negredo attempts the Zidane ‘roulette’ turn only to fall over and give away a free-kick at the same time. Yup, that’s the kind of start we’ve had. 2 min: Guzan, who is deputising for the injured Valdés in Boro’s goal today, clears a couple of times none too comfortably due to the piercing low winter sun that is dazzling him. He might want to invest in a cap. 1 min: We’re off. Middlesbrough, in red of course, get the game under way. They’re shooting from right to left on my TV. Leicester, in royal blue, the other way. The players stroll out on to the Riverside turf to this: Yeah, sorry about that. Leicester have sacked their head coach! The Tigers, not the Foxes, mind. It’s Aitor Karanka’s turn to say a few words: “After that game [the deflating late defeat at Manchester United] I said we should keep our performance. The result wasn’t good but the attitude of the players was. [Making five changes] is all about fresh legs, mentality and after having less than 48 hours to prepare I am expecting a tough game. The mental side of the game will be important today. I think it is about the balance – we are playing well and we have to keep going and showing our confidence and consistency and trying to score goals.” They’ve only scored 17. They’ve had a bid accepted for Rudy Gestede. They’re attempting to recreate Blackburn’s forward line of two years ago. It’s a novel approach. Claudio Ranieri speaks: “We won a lot of matches away last season but now we have to be strong. [I made] Five because after the other day it is much better to change something. The squad is the squad and I will play some players who used to play. Slimani has a fever and [as for] Drinkwater, after his injury, two matches in a row is too many.” “In regard to Arsenal’s Giroud’s fantastic scorpion goal kick against Crystal Palace yesterday, do you think that the scorpion kick was of the Fattail Scorpion variety, Heterometus, Hadrusus or Facekickus variety?” asks Raymond Reardon. I have no idea Raymond but I am surprised by how goals such as Giroud’s and Mkhitaryan’s still create such enthusiasm among people these days given that the internet is saturated with video clips of great goals from leagues all around the world, amateur and professional. I’m not saying it wasn’t a great goal but for me, I’d have been more excited if I wasn’t having clips shoved down my throat every day on Twitter. I’m all about the impact. A stat (that probably means nothing)! Middlesbrough: Guzan, Fabio da Silva, Chambers, Gibson, Barragan, Forshaw, de Roon, Clayton, Traore, Negredo, Ramirez. Subs: Konstantopoulos, Friend, Bernardo, Leadbitter, Rhodes, Stuani, Downing. Leicester: Schmeichel, Simpson, Morgan, Huth, Fuchs, Mahrez, King, Amartey, Mendy, Okazaki, Ulloa. Subs: Hernandez, Chilwell, Musa, Albrighton, Zieler, Gray, Wasilewski. Referee: Robert (Bobby) Madley (West Yorkshire) Hello. Happy New Year etc and so on. It’s 15th v 16th in the Premier League in a round of fixtures that take place about 48 minutes after the last round of Premier League fixtures . And you know what? It could be pretty tasty. You see, no one really knows how fit any of the players are and rotation will mean plenty of rust on show and a few players that will be raring to do something, anything, to impress their boss. As well as that, both sides have reason to be peering nervously over a shoulder at the pit of despair beneath them. Only four points separates Boro from Sunderland in 18th and, as for the champions, well they’re only a couple of points better off than Aitor Karanka’s lot and travel about as well as raw fish being hauled through a red-hot desert. Mind you, Leicester only went and won a game last time out. It was at home, of course. Meanwhile, Middlesbrough are pretty decent at home and Karanka has made it clear that this game is mighty important. “Now is the most important game in the season because it is against a direct opponent,” he roared. “All this season these are the kind of games we have to win. We are playing at home and always I say if we are playing this way we will win games against our opponents like we did against Swansea, against Hull, against Bournemouth. We know if we play with less intensity than we did [against Manchester United] we have problems, so we need to play with at least the same intensity.” As for Ranieri, he is still missing the man who inspired peak cringe in the East Midlands but will want to make the most of Riyad Mahrez before he goes to play in the Africa Cup of Nations. Ranieri says he’ll pick his team based on who says they feel fit and ready. So, will they win a league game away from home? “Sooner or later we have to win one match away,” beamed Ranieri when asked that question. “We made a fantastic performance against a team [West Ham] who were very confident. It was important to win but it is also important to start well in 2017. I will ask who has recovered well then pick the best team for Middlesbrough.” My prediction: Middlesbrough 2-2 Leicester','https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/jan/02/middlesbrough-v-leicester-city-premier-league-live','Middlesbrough 0-0 Leicester City: Premier League – as it happened',280,'football'),('sport/blog/2017/jan/02/aaron-rodgers-green-bay-packers-nfl','Not long ago the football world appeared to have given up on Aaron Rodgers. Now with the Green Bay Packers winning the NFC North he’s a popular pick for league MVP. This is how the NFL works. Seasons are rarely coronations; they are more tests or perseverance. People get hurt. Knees and ankles and shoulders fail. Bodies ache. Plans dissolve into mayhem. Teams rise and fall. Winning is survival. And with a week between each game, few things on this planet are as susceptible to overreaction and hyperbole as America’s most popular professional sport. In October, with the season only half-done and Rodgers still putting up near-300-yard passing games, it became popular to ask: What is wrong with Aaron Rodgers? Some said his personality turned off team-mates. Others pointed to poor mechanics. There were even suggestions that he had lost his accuracy. This led to mathematical breakdowns of his decline and lists of reasons as to why he was no longer the same. In a way, they might all have been right. Rodgers wasn’t as great as he had been a couple years before, but he wasn’t dreadful either. The Packers were struggling with injuries and lack of a running game not to mention defensive issues. They problems were not unlike those endured by many football teams, but because this was Rodgers and these were the Packers, whatever issues were there had been magnified by 10. Here on 2 January, with Green Bay having won five in a row and ready to host a playoff game next week, this is what is wrong with Aaron Rodgers: nothing. By now we should know everything is fine. He has never been as flawless as Tom Brady. There has always been an imperfection to his game that has made him great. He is best when things fall apart and the linemen rush in and he has to scramble for his life and to keep the play alive long enough for a receiver to slip open. During Sunday night’s 31-24 victory over the Detroit Lions, he had one play where he dodged tackles twice, ran around a bit, and then found a receiver open in the end zone and for a touchdown pass. It was vintage Rodgers. He finished the night with 300 yards and four touchdowns. He ended the season with more than 4,000 passing yards for the sixth time in his career. He was not intercepted in the last seven games and had just seven interceptions for the whole season. When Green Bay were 4-6 in November and looked lost, Rodgers was the one who pulled the team together, telling players they could indeed make the postseason. All they had to do was believe they could win their last six games. Then they did. “That’s what you have to do sometimes as a leader,” Rodgers said Sunday via the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. “You have to exude confidence even in a situation where it seems to the outside world that confidence shouldn’t exist.” So much of the time the NFL is about surviving calamity. The Packers did that. After Green Bay won a playoff game over Washington last January, I watched, in the Packers locker room, as Rodgers gingerly pulled on his shoes before limping to a postgame press conference. He had not been fantastic. There were few big passes. He only threw for 210 yards, but he had been a leader. He pulled the Packers through a road playoff game when they had trailed 11-0 and all seemed lost. “Been there done that,” he said that night when asked how Green Bay had managed to survive. That’s the NFL today. Find a way when nothing else seems to work. No team is an individual but there is also little doubt the Packers’ division title is because of Rodgers. While some will say the league’s MVP is Tom Brady or Atlanta quarterback Matt Ryan, who had a 117 passer rating this season or Dallas’s rookie running back Ezekiel Elliott and his 1,631 rushing yards, there’s an excellent chance Rodgers wins the award for the third time. Fantasy player Of the week When the Minnesota Vikings traded for Sam Bradford in September the move was one of desperation. They had just lost starting quarterback Teddy Bridgewater to a horrible knee injury and needed someone to lead what was supposed to be a playoff team. The Vikings started 5-0 and then bombed, but Bradford turned out to be better than expected. He finished the year with a league-record 71.6 completion percentage. On Sunday he completed 25 of 33 passes for 250 yards and three touchdowns. One can probably argue that Bradford might not have been dynamic enough, going for safer throws, but given the situation he was thrown into and the chaos of having offensive coordinator Norv Turner leave mid-season, this was easily Bradford’s best NFL season and revived his career – whether in Minnesota or somewhere else. Gif oF the week Good sense says the New England Patriots did not need to sign receiver Michael Floyd when the Cardinals released him a few weeks ago. The release had come after Floyd’s arrest for what police in Arizona described as “a super DUI” with a blood-alcohol content of .217. A former first-round pick in 2012, Floyd has never fully reached his potential as a player. But sometimes the Patriots do things that will baffle you until suddenly everything becomes obvious. The reason for Floyd’s signing came perfectly clear in the third quarter of New England’s 35-14 victory over Miami on Sunday. This is when he flatted the Dolphins Tony Lippett with a huge block that freed receiver Julian Edelman for a 77-yard touchdown pass. So, once again it looks like Bill Belichick has got it right on the field - whether the ethics are correct is another question. Stat of the week Zero. The number of seconds it took for the New York Jets to score 10 points against the Buffalo Bills. Yes, this is possible to do, although usually it is the Jets who seem to find themselves on the other side of such a predicament. Still, the Bills who were formerly coached by Rex Ryan have had their own disasters and Sunday’s 30-10 loss in the Meadowlands counts as such. They managed just 230 total yards and allowed their former castoff (and future Jets castoff) Ryan Fitzpatrick to pick them apart for two touchdowns and a 109 passer rating. But the worst part of the day came with just 3:21 left in the game when the Jets kicked off after scoring a field goal, sending the ball to Buffalo’s 15 yard line. The Bills Mike Gillislee seemed perplexed as to the kick’s location then panicked as the ball rolled into the end zone. He stepped away from it making the mistake of forgetting that a kickoff not actually downed is a live ball. Alas, the Jets Doug Middleton fell on the rolling ball for a touchdown and a rare moment of Jet brilliance. And since he did so in the end zone, no time ran off the clock. In case you need visual proof, here is how you score 10 points in zero seconds: Stat of the week II Five. The number of times Saints quarterback Drew Brees has thrown for 5,000 yards in his career. Given that only four other players have thrown for 5,000 yards in a season and that each of those has only done so once, Brees’s feat is remarkable indeed. There is a chance this could be his last game in New Orleans. The great offensive machine he and coach Sean Payton built 11 years ago seems to be reaching the end. Payton is rumored to be leaving for the Rams while Brees, who has just a season left on his contract, may want to join a team more capable of a Super Bowl run than the Saints. If Sunday’s 38-32 loss to Atlanta was his last run in New Orleans, what a run it has been for a player who was essentially kicked out of San Diego in favor of Philip Rivers. When Brees took over in New Orleans, the Saints’ future in the city was still uncertain after Hurricane Katrina. Now, more than a decade later, the Saints are a civic treasure and the Chargers on the verge of leaving San Diego. Quote of the week “That part of it felt good, throwing a touchdown. Weirdly you kind of expect it when you go out there. ‘Let’s go out and throw a touchdown.’ I know that sounds silly, but you expect to go out there and do something well. In that regard it felt normal.” What would Tony Romo have done with this Cowboys team? Would he have been able to ride behind a great offensive line and Ezekiel Elliott’s fantastic rookie year to a 13-3 record and home field advantage through the playoffs? Sadly we will never know. But in the one possession he played this season – in the second quarter of Dallas’s 27-13 loss at Philadelphia - he moved the Cowboys on a six-play-81-yard touchdown drive that culminated in a pass that he rifled into the arms of Terrance Williams. It gave at least a thought to what might have been. Elsewhere around the league -- Patriots quarterback Tom Brady broke the NFL season record for touchdowns to interceptions ratio with 28 touchdowns against just two picks. He threw three of those touchdowns on Sunday in a 35-14 victory over Miami. -- The Cleveland Browns tried hard to win their second game of the season, scoring a touchdown late in the fourth quarter of their game at Pittsburgh to force overtime, even taking a lead in overtime before losing 27-24. Robert Griffin III continued to show sparks of promise as he threw for 232 yards and two touchdowns and ran for 32 more yards. -- Philadelphia activated running back Terrell Watson whose remarkable story was profiled by the Guardian this summer. In his first NFL game Watson ran for 28 yards on nine carries and even scored a touchdown late in the Eagles win over Dallas.','https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/jan/02/aaron-rodgers-green-bay-packers-nfl','We finally found out what\'s wrong with Aaron Rodgers: absolutely nothing',281,'sport'),('business/2017/jan/02/chancellor-failing-cancel-tax-giveaway-banks-says-labour-john-mcdonnell','John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has accused Philip Hammond of failing to cancel a “tax giveaway” by his predecessor to Britain’s biggest banks, worth more than £1bn this year. In his summer budget after the 2015 general election, the then chancellor George Osborne announced deep cuts to the bank levy, which was introduced after the financial crisis and charged according to the size of banks’ balance sheets. Big banks, including HSBC and Standard Chartered, which felt penalised by the levy, told him that they could move their headquarters outside the UK. Osborne announced phased cuts in the levy over the parliament and made up the shortfall in revenue by imposing an 8% surcharge on banks’ corporation tax, which falls on all lenders, not just the largest. McDonnell said by failing to reverse the cuts in the bank levy in November’s autumn statement, Hammond was handing the big banks a rebate taxpayers could ill afford. The latest forecasts from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, published alongside the autumn statement, showed revenue from the bank levy at £2.7bn for the current financial year, instead of the £3.8bn expected in March 2015, before the general election. “Philip Hammond tried to sneak out the fact that he has continued this cut in the bank levy, which will provide big banks with a tax giveaway larger than under even George Osborne. “The fact that we are seeing such a large handout to the biggest banks in our country at a time when we are seeing cuts to our schools, NHS and a funding crisis in our care service is truly shameful.” McDonnell, who is the closest ally of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, will make a major speech on economic policy this month and hopes to draw a clear dividing line with the Conservatives by showing that he would take on vested interests as chancellor. He recently made a series of spending pledges to protect pensioner benefits, including the costly triple-lock guarantee (that pensions rise by the same as average earnings, consumer price index or 2.5%, whichever is highest), in an effort to win over elderly voters. Labour also wants to show that it will fight to avoid a “bankers’ Brexit” – protecting the interests of the City at the expense of ordinary taxpayers – though it has said it would like to see the continuation of “passporting”, the regime allowing UK-based banks to trade throughout the EU. A spokesman for McDonnell said Labour would reverse the cuts to the levy and would be unlikely to remove the corporation tax surcharge, because it came alongside a series of cuts in the corporation tax rate which had reduced big corporations’ tax liability. When the government announced that policy, the Treasury minister Harriet Baldwin told MPs: “It means that the overall rate of corporation tax will be slightly lower for banks than it was in 2010.” Britain’s competition watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), warned that the shift to the corporation tax levy would reduce the advantages of the tax system for smaller banks trying to break into the market. So-called challenger banks told the CMA they expected to be paying up to £123m more in tax between them by 2020-21 as a result of the changes. “The overall effect, compared with the pre-2016 position, is that the tax advantages of smaller banks including new entrants have been reduced as a result of the changes to the bank levy and the introduction of the CTS [corporation tax surcharge]. Therefore, any effect that these tax advantages had in offsetting the barriers to entry and expansion such banks face are likely to be reduced,” the CMA said. A Treasury spokesperson said: “The government is clear that banks, like all businesses, must pay the right amount of tax. The reform of the bank levy was announced alongside the introduction of a new 8% surcharge on bank profit. Together, the levy and the surcharge are expected to raise over £18bn from banks over the next five years.‎” McDonnell also called for Hammond to abandon “deeply unfair” cuts to the corporation tax rate, saying the money could have been used to fund teachers, nurses and police officers. The rate has been reduced from 28% in 2010 when David Cameron became prime minister, to 20% and will fall to 19% in April under plans to reduce it to 17% in 2020. The cuts will be worth almost £15bn a year to businesses by 2021 and Labour claims this is equivalent to employing 12,000 nurses, 10,000 police officers and 10,000 teachers full-time every year for a decade. McDonnell said: “We have known for a long time that the Tories’ cuts to corporation tax have cost the exchequer billions and today we have laid bare what this means for our public services. “Labour is calling on the government to reverse these deeply unfair tax giveaways and start properly investing in our vital public services.”','https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/02/chancellor-failing-cancel-tax-giveaway-banks-says-labour-john-mcdonnell','Chancellor failing to cancel ‘tax giveaway’ to banks, says Labour',282,'business'),('uk-news/2017/jan/02/britain-faces-icy-return-to-work-at-start-of-2017','Millions of commuters could face travel disruption on their return to work on Tuesday, with icy conditions forecast for London and large swaths of England and Wales. Forecasters warned that roads may be treacherous after subzero temperatures overnight on Monday across most of Britain, with up to 5cm of snow on high ground. A Met Office severe weather warning for ice is in place for east Wales and a large stretch of England, from Manchester to the west Midlands and south-east to the capital. Frank Saunders, the Met Office’s chief meteorologist, said: “We are advising commuters to pay particular attention to the potential for ice and frost to affect journeys tomorrow morning. “Although most gritted surfaces will stay ice-free, there is a particular for risk that pavements and untreated roads, especially minor ones, could be very slippery. “A very cold night is in store for many and, as moister air comes in to contact with cold surfaces later, there is the potential for a lot of frost to form, rendering some surfaces hazardous.” Large areas of Scotland, Northern Ireland and the north of England were worst hit by the cold snap on Monday, with a severe weather warning for ice in place from the Scottish Highlands down to Yorkshire. But it is the south of England that will start the new year with the coldest temperatures. The mercury will fall to -6C in the Oxfordshire village of Benson on Monday and into Tuesday, while temperatures will reach -3C in Reading and -2C in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. In its severe weather warning for central England and east Wales, the Met Office said: “Please be aware that untreated surfaces, such as pavements and some minor roads, are likely to turn very slippery later Monday night and on Tuesday morning. A few freezing fog patches are also possible.” The yellow weather warning – meaning be aware – was in force until 10am on Tuesday, although the hazardous driving conditions may persist into Tuesday in the worst-affected areas. Millions of commuters will return to work on Tuesday after the Christmas break and bank holiday Monday. Rod Dennis, a spokesman for the RAC, urged motorists to stick to major routes, which were more likely to be gritted. He said: “Drivers are facing a mix of hazards, notably much colder conditions. Any lingering fog calls for drivers to adjust their speed and maintain longer stopping distances and to use dipped headlights. Only use your car’s fog lights if visibility is badly reduced, as using them when it’s not means you risk dazzling other drivers. “Motorists should remember that if their car thermometer records a temperature of 4C (39F) or lower, there is a good chance the road temperature is near or even below freezing, meaning a very real risk of ice and slippery roads.” The AA said Tuesday was typically the busiest of the year for breakdowns as many vehicles were left unused over the festive period. Its spokesman, Max Holdstock, said: “The first working day back in January is traditionally one of the busiest days of the year for breakdowns, with flat batteries the main culprit. The issue is that many cars get left unused for up to a fortnight in often cold conditions, which causes the power output of the battery to drop. “If your car has been left sitting idle or has been used for mostly short, stop-start journeys, ideally trickle charge the battery. Or, if weather conditions permit, take it out before Monday for at least half an hour to boost the battery.”','https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/02/britain-faces-icy-return-to-work-at-start-of-2017','Britain faces icy return to work at beginning of 2017',283,'uk-news'),('uk-news/2017/jan/02/sheffield-tree-activists-vow-to-protect-jewel-in-the-crown-rivelin-valley-road','A bitter dispute over the future of hundreds of roadside trees in Sheffield looks set to continue into 2017, as campaigners rally to protect the second longest avenue of limes in the UK. The row came to national attention in November when council contractors summoned people out of bed to move their cars and police detained protesters as eight trees were chopped down in Hallam. Nick Clegg, the local MP, said it was “something you’d expect to see in Putin’s Russia rather than a Sheffield suburb”. The council apologised and promised not to employ the same tactics again. But the dispute is far from over. Residents are determined to save 31 towering lime trees set to be cut down on leafy Rivelin Valley Road, described as one of the jewels in Sheffield’s arboreal crown. The road, which was built in 1907 by the local water company, is lined by 700 lime trees across three and a half miles, second only to Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire. Rebecca Hammond, a local protester, said the plan to remove some of the trees would create two clear gaps in the avenue. “The visual impact will be humongous. There’s no need for it,” she said. “If all of those go in one go, it will not look the same in my lifetime. Those trees are now over 100 years old and if they’re replaced with saplings it’s going to be a long time before it looks the same.” She said local people had been told that most of the trees would be felled because the roots could be damaged when the road was resurfaced. “That’s a bit like saying I might graze my finger and it might go septic so I’m going to amputate my hand now,” Hammond said. “That’s lazy and unacceptable.” She added: “Lots of people, not just in Sheffield but even people who now live abroad, remember Rivelin Valley Road and what it is – a majestic avenue of lime trees. It is so loved, Sheffield-wide. It’s not just a local thing. It’s not just the tree outside my house on my street. It’s actually a Sheffield landmark.” The fight for Sheffield’s trees has its roots in a 25-year private finance initiative (PFI) deal signed by the Labour-run council in 2012. The contractor Amey is tasked with maintaining the city’s 36,000 roadside trees as part of a road maintenance agreement that the company says will “see Sheffield’s roads transformed from some of the worst in the country to the best in the country within the first five years”. The contractor and council say the trees that are being removed are diseased or dangerous, but protesters say many of them simply do not fit in with Amey’s resurfacing approach. Nearly 2,000 people have signed a petition urging the council to reconsider felling the 31 lime trees, which they describe as “an invaluable asset to Sheffield and its heritage”. Bryan Lodge, the council’s cabinet member for the environment, said: “The independent tree panel is looking at the trees on Rivelin Valley Road. We have not yet received its report so are unable to provide definite plans or timescales at this stage. We will provide more information as the process continues. “We have taken on board comments, good and bad, over the past year and I want people in Sheffield to know that we will use this feedback to inform how we work to maintain and improve Sheffield’s streets – for now and future generations. Where trees are removed, we will replace them.”','https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/02/sheffield-tree-activists-vow-to-protect-jewel-in-the-crown-rivelin-valley-road','Sheffield tree activists vow to protect \'jewel in the crown\'',284,'uk-news'),('commentisfree/2017/jan/02/christmas-exodus-festive-gathering-family-time','Here we go again – back to work after the festive season. And this is perhaps one benefit of the extended Christmas/New Year period: by the time you get to the end of it, you may well be ready, if not busting, to get away from your relatives, run around a deserted open space screaming, and go back to work. Even if you love them. After the complex stew of family life, the office, the building site or even the staff room and chalkface could seem like&nbsp;heaven. But it may not be such a relief for those who no longer go to work, who’ve just had one giant, intense dose of family and friends, and that’s their lot for another year. About 40 years ago a friend told me he only saw his parents at Christmas. He seemed happy about this arrangement, and I rather admired it, because it appeared to show a sensible, grown-up level of detachment that my family didn’t have. Although in my early 30s, I still saw my parents weekly and phoned them almost daily, because without regular check-ins, updates and visits, there would be panic, anxiety and sometimes screaming reprimands from my mother’s end. But looking back, perhaps my friend’s method wasn’t so admirable. What if his retired parents bravely waved him off, then sat down in their empty house and sobbed, longing for next year, and the return of their beloved son. If only a happy medium were possible, and family visits could be spread out evenly, rather than come in one huge and rather difficult chunk; and family gatherings, along with Crisis at Christmas and special free church dinners, or being pleasant to elderly people and relatives you can’t usually be fagged to talk to. If only we could have it in smaller dollops all year round, and not just for Christmas. Easier said than done. Families are scattered all over the place nowadays: up and down the country, grandparents retired to Spain, children and grandchildren moved to distant continents, divorced parents in different directions. Which ones do you visit, and when? Can you afford the time and the money? Or can you only have a Skype Christmas? It all adds to the tension. Then, exhausted, bloated, agitated and possibly bankrupt, we must welcome in the new year, which I find more distressing than Christmas. Strangely, singing Auld Lang Syne gives me asthma. The first time it happened I thought it was the hostess’s cat, but by the third time I knew it was that song, so I hid in the larder eating cold pudding until it was over. What a relief to stop being infantilised by your mummy, daddy and aunties, and get back to work and have structure and restraint, and fairly Spartan dinners, and I suspect some of the unemployed and elderly people left at home might also be temporarily thrilled to bits when everyone clears off. No more pandering to tantrumming grandchildren, crazed by additives, sugar and excess presents. No more exhausting cooking for visitors, and no more behaving yourself when visiting. But it won’t take long before the twinkly lights will have all gone, and the&nbsp;relief and back-to-normal feeling wears off. The weather is growing bleaker and colder, and the world is becoming scarier. Hold on to your hats, everyone. Brace yourselves. We’ll be lucky if we have many more Christmases to moan about. Never mind the third world war, nuclear holocaust and the global warming tipping point, the Institute for Public Policy Research predictions are not much fun either. By Christmas 2030, our over-65s will have increased by 30%, we’ll have double the number of over-85s, and an 80% increase in the number of adults over 65 with dementia. And as 15 million current human jobs will be automated, there won’t be much work to go back to. But we’ll probably manage. It’s like childbirth. By this time next year, you’ll have forgotten the pain and you’ll probably want to do it all over again. I will, to celebrate that the world has survived another year, despite the rotten odds. Oh please, please let there be Christmas dilemmas to moan about for ever and ever, Amen.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/02/christmas-exodus-festive-gathering-family-time','Spare a thought for those left behind after the Christmas exodus | Michele Hanson',285,'commentisfree'),('football/2017/jan/02/bayern-munich-give-swansea-permission-to-speak-with-paul-clement','Swansea will name Paul Clement as their third manager of the season on Tuesday after the former Derby County manager agreed a 2½-year contract to replace Bob Bradley. Clement is likely to be in the stands at Selhurst Park on Tuesday evening for the match with Crystal Palace having asked Bayern Munich to leave his role as Carlo Ancelotti’s assistant in order to take over at the Liberty Stadium. The 44‑year‑old will not travel to Doha for Bayern’s warm‑weather training camp having agreed a deal in principle running until 2019 with Swansea. “Co-coach Paul Clement has asked FC&nbsp;Bayern Munich to hold talks with Premier League club Swansea City about a commitment as head coach,” read a statement on Bayern’s website. “Bayern’s head coach Carlo Ancelotti and the management board of FC Bayern Munich have fulfilled this wish.” Clement, who has served as Ancelotti’s assistant at Chelsea, Paris Saint‑Germain and Real Madrid, will take over with Swansea bottom of the table having endured a fourth successive Premier League defeat against Bournemouth on Saturday. They trail 17th-placed Palace by four points, who are still looking for their first win under Sam Allardyce. Allardyce’s attempt to appoint Clement as his assistant with England was blocked by Bayern in July because the club were not keen on him job-sharing and the now Palace manager has admitted the former teacher has gained significant experience from working at some of the world’s biggest clubs. “It’s down to his coaching, his coaching of the players, organisation of the players and the experience he’s gained with Ancelotti,” said Allardyce. “Going into that position, I’ve been there many times before so I’m not going to shell out any advice now because I don’t want to give him anything he might be able to use. We’ll talk after the game by which time we’ve won hopefully, fingers crossed.”','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/02/bayern-munich-give-swansea-permission-to-speak-with-paul-clement','Swansea set to appoint Paul Clement as new manager until 2019',286,'football'),('society/2017/jan/02/book-explaining-gender-diversity-to-primary-school-children-sparks-furore','“My name is Kit and I’m 12 years old. I live in a house with my mum and dad, and our dog, Pickle. When I was born, the doctors told my mum and dad that they had a baby girl, and so for the first few years of my life that’s how my parents raised me. This is called being assigned female at birth. I wasn’t ever very happy that way.” These are the opening lines of a controversial new book called Can I Tell You About Gender Diversity? which is being introduced into some primary schools as a resource for children, parents and teachers, and claims to be the first book to explain “medical transitioning” to children as young as seven. It is not published until later this month, but the slim volume has already prompted fury from the Mail on Sunday, former Tory party chairman Lord Tebbit and one-time Conservative Home Office minister Ann Widdecombe, as well as Mail columnist Sarah Vine who complained that the target audience was children not even ready to choose their A-levels, “let alone challenge their own biology”. The book is written by LGBT activist CJ Atkinson. Speaking to the Guardian in their first ever interview, Atkinson condemned the media coverage as misleading, inaccurate and potentially harmful for young people who identify as transgender. “We call it trans-panic,” said Atkinson, adding: “This mud-slinging has to stop. It causes active harm. When you have a group of transgender young people, one in two will consider suicide, one in three will attempt it.” Under the headline “Stop calling them boys and girls!”, the Mail on Sunday told readers that the book advised that children as young as seven should be taught in schools to stop using the terms boys and girls in case they discriminate against transgender pupils. In response, Tebbit said it was damaging to children to introduce uncertainty into their minds. Meanwhile, under the headline “Gender, our children and the death of common sense”, Vine said in her column: “In attempting to improve the lives of a vanishingly small minority, we are threatening the sanity of – and yes I’m going to say it – normal children. It’s time to put an end to this nonsense.” Atkinson, a published poet but first-time author, denied advocating that school children should stop using the terms boys and girls as widely reported. “I would not go to a seven-year-old and say, ‘You can’t call yourself anything.’ That’s not what I’ve written. “If you identify as a girl, assigned female at birth, and you like the colour pink, you like wearing dresses and sparkly things, that’s awesome. But if you are a boy who likes pink sparkly things that’s also awesome. “It’s not a case of saying, let’s break everything down so that there’s nothing, so there’s no meaning in anything. It’s a case of opening it up so everybody can have access to everything. “Writing the book, I had joked about the fact that I knew there would be some people who would not read it but would still have a lot to say about it. I’m not naive,” said Atkinson, who is an ambassador for Educate &amp; Celebrate, which has developed an Ofsted-recognised programme to support LGBTQ inclusion in schools with the help of £200,000 funding from the Department for Education. “Lord Tebbit said it’s the worst thing on earth – he’s very opposed to the idea of the book. Ann Widdecombe said it was dotty. In this particular case, quite literally they don’t know what they are talking about. They have not read the book,” said Atkinson. The 60-page booklet is the latest in the Can I Tell You About ...? series of books published by Jessica Kingsley Publishers which are designed to offer a simple introduction to sometimes complex and challenging issues, including adoption, autism, depression, eating disorders and ME/chronic fatigue syndrome. “The books are designed for kids from the age of seven,” explains Atkinson, who identifies as queer and uses the pronouns they, their and them. Two-thirds of each book in the series is about a person who is experiencing the issue the book aims to discuss (in this case Kit and gender diversity), and the remainder is a section called “How other people can help” which provides factual information for others, including teachers and parents. Kit, the protagonist, doesn’t like playing with dolls or wearing dresses and at the age of three asks to be called Christopher. “You see,” explains Kit, “I have a different gender identity than I was assigned at birth. Another name for this is called being transgender.” He begins to wear boys’ clothes, using he/him pronouns, changes his name on his birth certificate and explains that hormone blockers will stop him going through female puberty “and stop my body developing in ways that make me unhappy”. He thinks he will take testosterone at 16 so he can go through male puberty with the other boys in his class; he goes on to talk about surgery as part of transitioning, about gender dysphoria and the use of different pronouns – while Kit has chosen he, his friend Amy is she, Sam has chosen they, and Leigh xe. Atkinson, a practising Anglican who grew up in Bradford and went to an all-girls grammar school, said: “My upbringing was very traditional. My parents have always been very supportive. I know I’m lucky. But I know that the luck that I have is not shared by a lot of people. “The world is changing. A book like this is needed. People want to help. They want to know. They want to have conversations but they don’t know how. A lot of the time it is not being dealt with or talked about in schools.” Last week it emerged that Childline has been receiving an average of eight calls a day from children and adolescents about gender dysphoria and transgender issues – more than double the number received the year before, with callers complaining of bullying and transphobia. A spokesperson for Jessica Kingsley Publishers said the book had been commissioned because of a lack of available resources currently in schools. “With the growing number of children questioning their gender, schools and parents across the country have been challenged over the limited support they can offer them. “The introduction of gender-neutral toilets and non-binary pronouns are important first steps, but there is a definite lack of resources out there for teachers, parents and children themselves. “This book will spark discussion in the classroom and at home, answering difficult questions that children may have about gender diversity.”','https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/02/book-explaining-gender-diversity-to-primary-school-children-sparks-furore','Book explaining gender diversity to primary school children sparks furore',287,'society'),('world/2017/jan/02/british-woman-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-jailed-in-iran-released-from-solitary-confinement','A British-Iranian woman being held in an Iranian prison has been released from solitary confinement, her husband has said. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 37, was sentenced in September to five years in prison on secret charges related to a “soft overthrow” of the country’s government that were not revealed in open court. She had been restricted from any contact with fellow inmates at Tehran’s Evin prison until a week ago, when she was moved to a general ward, Richard Ratcliffe, her husband, told the BBC. However, Ratcliffe also criticised the lack of action from the British government, which has never publicly called for his wife to be released. Insisting his wife is innocent, he accused officials of allowing his family to be “caught up as a bargaining chip in international politics”. Ratcliffe told the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that his wife was released from solitary confinement for the first time over the Christmas period and was now being held with about 30 other women. She had been on hunger strike and had suicidal thoughts, he said, but the move had lifted her spirits. “She’s still sad and very low but there’s more fight in her again. I think having been moved so that she’s with other women makes a big difference,” Ratcliffe said. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested at Imam Khomeini airport on 3 April as she was trying to return to Britain after a holiday visiting family with her two-year-old daughter, Gabriella. The toddler is being looked after by her grandparents in Tehran. Ratcliffe had originally kept silent about the plight of his wife and daughter, but eventually went public in an effort to put pressure on Iranian authorities – a move he credits with helping improve her situation. But he said he had been left “pretty cross” by the apparent lack of effort made by Britain to secure her release. “I think they certainly could have stood up for Nazanin a bit more. They have never publicly called for her release, they never criticised her treatment,” Ratcliffe said. He has previously said he believes an unpaid £500m debt relating to an arms deal dating back to Iran’s pre-revolutionary era may be a motive behind Iran’s actions. “And I would stand by that,” he said. “It’s exactly what it’s about and obviously then our family being caught up as a bargaining chip in international politics is a pretty tough place to be.” Ratcliffe said he expected his wife’s appeal to be heard on Wednesday, and hoped the new hearing would reveal some detail of the charges she faced. In the meantime, he is trying to get a visa to enter the country and visit his daughter, who celebrated her second birthday in June without her mother or father.','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/02/british-woman-nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe-jailed-in-iran-released-from-solitary-confinement','British woman jailed in Iran released from solitary confinement',288,'world'),('commentisfree/2017/jan/02/binge-drinking-happens-binge-moralising-women-problem','Every year in the name apparently of guarding our nation’s glorious morals, some creepy photographers go around taking upskirt shots of young women. Women who have got drunk and have collapsed are the prize: lots of leg, sprawled in a doorway after “tottering” in high heels, tiny dresses hiked up, their knickers showing. This is what we want. The confirmation of the end of the world as we know it. Every year. For it’s been a pretty regular occurrence for the past decade at least, this montage of the paralytic bad girls. It comes around just as often as the pictures of the good girls: the leaping blondes celebrating A-level results. The “news” is apparently that some people got drunk on New Year’s Eve. The horror is that some of these people were female. This has made Daily Mail columnist Sarah Vine want “to weep for today’s young women”. Don’t let me stop you, weep away. I could weep too. Their opportunities in life have certainly been curtailed by the work of Vine’s husband, Michael Gove, and his cronies. Yes, it is a shame some people end up legless and ill, but according to Vine the worst of it is that they won’t even be ashamed of themselves. “They won’t be filled with remorse or self-loathing,” she laments. But really why should they waste the energy when they are publicly shamed by these nasty pictures and extended photo-captions parading as articles such as this? Generally, I find self-loathing is unnecessary for working-class women; there are middle-class people paid to loathe you anyway. You may as well spend the time getting your nails done or whatever cheap thrill comes your way. This is not to defend drunkenness or indeed alcoholism, but let’s get some perspective here. For some, out-of-control drinking will mean ending up in A&amp;E, it will mean unprotected sex, unwanted pregnancy and increasing incidents of “domestic” violence over the festive season because, guess what, young women don’t drink on their own. Some will wake up and share hangover stories on social media, some will be severely ill, some will become dependent and find alcohol is a life-long problem. I don’t minimise these issues. But binge drinking is actually the preserve of the middle aged and middle class who sit at home with their fine wines destroying their livers while judging everyone else. The shaming of young working-class women is a staple of tabloid culture. The Sun has a go, but strangely can never attain the heights of the Mail’s joyless voyeuristic morality policing. The former has a picture of a bloke captioned, “A man having a wee in a street in Leeds” which, let’s face it, isn’t as thrilling as the Mail’s photo of a woman slumped on a bench in Cardiff. According to paper, people didn’t used to pre-load drinks or intentionally get in this state. This is not my experience at all. The actual story here and one that the tabloids are loth to tell is while there are many alcohol-related problems, overall young people are drinking less. Alcohol consumption has declined sharply since about 2004. Many young adults are teetotal (a growing Muslim population is part of this statistic) and most adults (about 80%) are making an attempt to drink less. Pubs are closing down and young people report both that they want to be sharp at work and that as social lives are partly lived online they require less booze. But why introduce some facts into a story when you can perv around judging women with fake pity, while simultaneously publicly shaming them? The end of civilisation will not come about because of some pixelated girls. Bingeing on booze is not good, but it happens. Binge moralising however is a problem. One tends to lose all contact with reality in a constant quest for the high of smug superiority. When you are getting your kicks from kicking an unconscious girl, perhaps it is time to look at yourself.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/02/binge-drinking-happens-binge-moralising-women-problem','Binge drinking happens.

As the Print Room’s clumsy, tying-itself-in-knots response points out, Barker’s play was broadcast on Radio 3 in 2013 with an all-white cast featuring Richard E Grant and Francesca Annis. As far as I can see, it passed without protest even though that was just a year after the furore that met the under-representation of east Asian actors in the RSC’s production of The Orphan of Zhao. That dispute was significant in raising awareness about the lack of roles available to east Asian actors, but clearly the message still hasn’t reached all British theatres. In 2017 every production on our stages should draw from the widest possible pool of talent and reflect the rich diversity of that talent. Four white actors is no reflection of that at all. Undoubtedly, attitudes to diversity have shifted since I wrote, almost exactly two years ago, that diversity is key to creativity. Organisations such as Act for Change and Tonic Theatre have played a major role in forcing the arts to start to think about how they operate and how they might bring about real diversity within their workforces and on stage, rather than paying lip service to the idea or doing nothing at all. Nevertheless, you can still see what looks like thoughtlessness and unconscious racism behind casting decisions, sometimes defended through talk of artistic freedom. If you want signs of progress, then I suppose a few years ago the Print Room’s casting would probably have passed without comment, just as Trevor Nunn’s all-white casting of The War of the Roses in 2015 would likely have gone unnoticed. It’s good that is increasingly less likely to happen. Diverse casting can challenge some audiences – I heard recently of a regional theatre whose casting of a black Cinderella one year led to emails and letters of protest. In that instance, it made the artistic director even more aware of the need to cast diversely. Perhaps it’s not surprising that audiences react in such a way when so much TV, film and theatre is still stuck in the past and casting directors still choose from the same small pool of actors, denying others opportunities and access. The arts are waking up to the need for greater diversity in terms of race, disability, gender and socio-economic background. But as long as the top-down structures at management and board level continue to favour those who are white, male and from social elites, these organisations will find themselves ill-equipped to bring about radical change.','https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2017/jan/02/theatre-diversity-progress-in-the-depths-of-dead-love','Theatre is coming to terms with its diversity problem.

I was so excited for a new band to emerge and now I’m excited to see where they go next. We played with them a couple of times and circulated the same festivals when we were starting off, so it’s a nostalgic kind of excitement to see them this spring. I’m also hugely curious about where they are going to take their songwriting and their trademark production. They can write killer melodies, so they could take the same route as Tame Impala and become more pop. If their new single is anything to go by, I’m looking forward to album number two. Peter Hook of New Order I’m looking forward to seeing what the 1975 do next. I’ve known Matt Healy since he was 12, because he’s from near me. I know his mother, Denise Welch, and the 1975 won the Wilmslow High School talent competition the year before I judged it. It was interesting watching him grow up because every time I was at a do where his mum was he’d be there and come over to talk. He’s a massive Joy Division fan. My daughter put the first 1975 album on my iPod without telling me who it was, and I got quite into it. Then I saw them recently at the Manchester arena, in front of 20,000 people, and they’ve improved so much. Their songs are quite radical because they don’t have breaks or changes, just grooves. At the arena, I was struck by how much their music reminded me of Brian Eno’s soundscapes – he’s made some of my favourite records – but with guitar and vocals. Afterwards I asked Matt: “Have you been listening to Eno, by any chance?” He said: “All the fuckin’ time, Hooky.” Little Simz I’m really excited about Welcome to Wonderland: The Experience, an event I am curating in February that is a part of the annual Roundhouse Rising festival. I’m super stoked for this show because I’ve been involved with the festival for the last three years, but I’ve played the small room. Now I I am playing on the main stage, and to host it for the first time is incredible. I also get to bring out artists I love and appreciate and respect. The first person that we’ve announced is Mick Jenkins, who I believe will do great things in the future. Everything he stands for I relate to – I think it’s what’s needed right now, especially in hip-hop. I want the show to be for the people rather than be simply a major label putting a festival together. As well as music, we’re going to have exhibitions, with artists such as McKay Felt, who illustrated the album cover for Stillness in Wonderland and more. We want to make it feel communal. Clem Burke of Blondie I am really looking forward to the new release by Crystal Fairy, a new group comprised of the Melvins’ Buzz Osborne and Dale Crover along with Teri Gender Bender of Le Butcherettes and Omar Rodríguez-López from At the Drive In. All the musicians in Crystal Fairy are iconoclasts, so I can only imagine the innovation to come from this collaboration. I am also looking forward to the release of The Colossus of Destiny: A Melvins Tale film. The Melvins defied all the rules about how to survive in the wicked world of the music business, and I expect the film to show a band that doesn’t take itself too seriously – and is all the better for it. I’m also interested in hearing the new record by Fat White Family. I’ve seen them live several times, and I think their mix of Frank Zappa/Captain Beefheart-meets-Velvet Underground/Modern Lovers is very interesting indeed. I also hear that a new Flamin’ Groovies is record on the way. The Groovies’ Shake Some Action is a powerpop classic, and with three of the original members, including Cyril Jordan, involved in this new record I expect great things. Karl Hyde of Underworld I was first turned on to Efterklang by John Peel. Rick [Smith] and I sat in for him on his Radio 1 show while he was on holiday in autumn 2004. When we asked if there was anything he wanted us to play in his absence, he pointed us in the direction of their first album, Tripper. Tragically, John – who’d been our mentor since we were kids – never came home and music lost arguably its greatest friend. In the weeks that followed, I decided I had to go and find Efterklang to let them know that John had requested we play them. We struck up a friendship and are now collaborating on a score for a multiscreen art installation I’ve created. Efterklang defy definitions of what a band can be, sometimes performing as a three piece, sometimes with a choir and orchestra, packing out small clubs or concert halls. Casper Clausen is one of the most naturally gifted singers I’ve ever heard – a magnetic presence on any size of stage. The last time I saw them was a hometown gig in Sønderborg in 2014. The encore consisted of the band leading a parade out of the hall to perform a second concert with their parents in the foyer. Their next London show, in March, is their take on an opera. Called Leaves and based on the story of an underground cult, it was conceived as a fully immersive performance staged in a cold war bunker under an abandoned hospital in Copenhagen. It’s been reworked to fit the main room of the Barbican. I can’t wait. Shirley Collins It’s the prospect of working with English morris dancers in 2017 that excites me. As with any art form, it can be good or bad. Done poorly, it’s feeble, but it’s thrilling when danced well. There’s not a better sight than the Brighton Morris Men, sticks raised, surging forward, manly and a bit threatening. These dancers care, there is athleticism in their high leaps, grace in their turns, and beauty in the waving of their handkerchiefs. Yes – really! And the music is so English – wonderful tunes and harmonies. They are appearing on my forthcoming Lodestar shows, along with the youthful women’s side, Boss Morris, formed by Alex Merry. I am proud to support this challenging side of light, graceful dancers, so appealing in their contemporary costumes. They dance the morris properly, bringing a breath of fresh air and fun to it while retaining an age-old mystery with their prowling animal figures. And like Brighton Morris Men, they understand how properly paced the dancing should be. Shake off your prejudices and allow yourselves to find pleasure and delight in honest, good-natured morris dancing. If it was good enough for the English composer George Butterworth … Jason Williamson of Sleaford Mods I’m not really big on getting excited about new releases. Saying that, I met Baxter Dury the other week and he asked me to do a verse on a tune he’s worked on, which will hopefully be included on his new album. I was really influenced by some of his stuff on his album Floor Show, particularly Cocaine Man, so it was a great honour to have been asked. The stuff he played me that he’d been working on was really good, brutal in places. I’m looking forward to hearing it as a complete album. Nelly Furtado I am excited to see the Toronto urban music scene continue to take over the world stage in 2017. I have lived in this city for 20 years, and have always thought our urban music scene was a well-kept secret. But in the last couple of years all of that has changed, and I could not be more proud to have played a role in it, from when I first started banging out trip-hop songs on Queen Street under the name Nelstar in the mid-90s [to now]. It is satisfying, when you stay in a city because you believe in its creative prowess and versatility, to witness its maturity, and to meet a new generation of artists carrying on that legacy. My favourite Toronto artists right now are River Tiber, Charlotte Day Wilson and Mustafa the Poet. They are all going to do big things in 2017.','https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2017/jan/02/musical-highlights-of-2017-peter-hook-ellie-rowsell-shirley-collins-and-more-share-their-tips','Musical highlights of 2017: Peter Hook, Ellie Rowsell, Shirley Collins and more share their tips',291,'music'),('film/2017/jan/02/us-uk-box-office-top-20-2016-fantasy-sci-fi-film','Only two of the 20 best-performing films in the US in 2016 was a “real world” story, compared with four in the UK. Jason Bourne, Paul Greengrass’s triumphant return for Matt Damon’s amnesiac spy, came in at No 12 in the North American year-end charts, amid a sea of superhero movies, sci-fi space yarns and family films. At No 20, Dwayne Johnson/Kevin Hart comedy Central Intelligence also sounded a battle cry for semi-realism. Finding Dory was the top film of 2016 in the US, taking $486m domestically, followed by Captain America: Civil War ($408m) and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, which has so far taken $396m after a fortnight on release. The remainder of the top 20 are comic book adaptations such as Deadpool, Doctor Strange and Suicide Squad, children’s fare such as The Secret Life of Pets and Trolls, and franchise expansions including Star Trek Beyond, X-Men: Apocalypse and Harry Potter spin-off Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Original properties proved strong in animation, with Moana, The Secret Life of Pets, Zootopia and Sing all faring well despite a lack of prior brand awareness. A number of titles perceived at the time of release to have underperformed also made the cut, including the latest Star Trek movie and Paul Feig’s female reboot of Ghostbusters. The UK’s equivalent chart suggested audiences there had slightly more preference for stories set within the bounds of reality, with Bridget Jones’s Baby, The Girl on the Train and The Revenant joining Jason Bourne in the top 20 (Central Intelligence came in at No 36). The best-performing film in the UK was The Jungle Book; Finding Dory came in third, after Bridget Jones’s Baby.

The new law presumes consent for organs to be removed, even if it goes against the wishes of the family. Until 1 January, when the legislation took effect, unless the person who had died had previously expressed a clear wish for or against donation, doctors were required to consult relatives who, in almost a third of cases, refused. Those who do not want all or any of their organs to be used must now put their name on a “refusal register” – so far 150,000 people have signed up. The authorities have promised to make it easier for those who wish to refuse by allowing them to join the register online instead of by registered post. Alternatively, those vehemently opposed to their organs being used can leave a signed document with their next-of-kin or transmit their wish orally to relatives who must make a written declaration of non-consent to doctors at the time of death. The process is explained on the agency’s Facebook page. In November, the French Agence de la Biomédecine released a film, Déjà-vu2, aimed at encouraging 15- to 25-year-olds to agree to organ donation. The European Union has highlighted the lack of organs for transplant and the increasing number of patients on waitings lists worldwide. Its figures claim that in 2014, 86,000 people were waiting for organ donations in EU states, Norway and Turkey, and 16 people were dying every day while waiting for a transplant. In the UK, doctors lament one of the lowest consent rates in Europe, as well as a shortage of donors from black or Asian communities. A record number of organs were donated and transplanted in the UK in 2015-16, but the rate remains short of the target of 80% by 2020. The biggest obstacle remains relatives’ opposition, who have vetoed transplants even from registered donors. NHSBT, which is responsible for the NHS organ donor register and for matching and allocating donor organs, said it was considering further steps it could take when approaching families to ensure more potential donors’ decisions were not vetoed. One option would be to no longer ask the next-of-kin to confirm consent or authorisation. Their permission is not required by law if someone has registered a decision to donate on the NHS organ donor register. Families in Scotland are already required to complete a retraction form to record why they overturned a relative’s decision to donate. NHSBT said a similar form could be introduced across the UK.','https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/02/france-organ-donation-law','France introduces opt-out policy on organ donation',293,'society'),('us-news/2017/jan/02/new-us-laws-guns-minimum-wage-domestic-violence','In 2017, new laws across the US will go into effect. Here are some of the new, noteworthy, and impactful policies: Guns: there may be more armed teenagers in Tennessee A range of new gun legislation will go into effect, and while places such as California are working to restrict guns, Tennessee is opening up its gun laws. Starting in 2017, 18-year-olds who are on active duty in the military, are retired veterans or were honorably discharged will be able to receive handgun carry permits. The age remains 21 for everyone else. The bill passed unanimously in the state senate. Other laws: More assault weapons are off limits in California, including semiautomatic rifles Californians will have to go through a background check to purchase not just guns but also ammunition Babysitters and other guests will be permitted to use deadly force against intruders, as part of Missouri’s new concealed carry law Minimum wage: many states to see minimum wage rise in 2017 Minimum wage increases remain a contentious political issue but in 2017, a record 20 states and the District of Columbia will see increased pay for low-wage workers. The fight for $15 is on in New York and California. New York is working toward a statewide $15-per-hour minimum wage but Governor Andrew Cuomo has different timelines, depending on each industry and location in the state. California’s minimum wage will go up to $10.50, with the hopes of reaching $15 by 2022. Ohio’s state legislature took steps to block Cleveland’s efforts to reach a $15 minimum wage by passing a law that forces local jurisdictions to maintain the same wage as the state rate, which will go up to $8.15 in 2017. The following minimum wage increases go into effect 1 January: Massachusetts: $10 to $11 Connecticut: $9.60 to $10.10 Arizona: $8.05 to $10 Colorado: $8.31 to $9.30 Arkansas: $8 to $8.50 Michigan: $8.50 to $8.90 Vermont: $9.60 to $10 Maine: $7.50 to $9 Hawaii: $8.50 to $9.25 Washington state: $9.47 to $11 Several other states will raise their minimum wages later in the year. The Economic Policy Institute tracks all the changes here. Domestic violence and sexual assault: hairdressers to provide support to victims Starting 1 January, cosmetologists, hairdressers and nail technicians in Illinois will be required to undergo one hour of training on how to provide support to victims of domestic violence or sexual assault. It will also be mandatory for establishments to hang posters with helpline details. Several California laws passed this year will also go into effect, addressing the prosecution of sexual assault crimes: Following the Brock Turner case, California implemented tougher sentencing guidelines for sexual assault cases California removed the statute of limitations in some rape cases, meaning there is no time limit for filing charges against an alleged perpetrator. Some say the move was inspired by Bill Cosby’s case The definition of rape has also been broadened to include “all forms of nonconsensual sexual assault” Alcohol and pot: Californians can get tipsy at beauty parlors A new law allows beauty parlors and salons to serve up to 12 ounces of complimentary alcohol without violating state liquor law requirements. In other substance-related developments, on election day in 2016, four states approved ballot initiatives legalizing recreational marijuana. Recreational pot will become legal in Nevada on 1 January. Maine’s law should go partially into effect in late January. In Connecticut, advanced practice registered nurses will now be allowed to certify a patient for medical marijuana use (except for glaucoma). New York announced a similar regulation in November. Health: doctors with religious objections will have to refer patients elsewhere A new law amends Illinois’s Health Care Right of Conscience Act to require that providers, including doctors and clinics, who refuse services for moral or religious reasons ensure their choice does not endanger patient health. That means doctors must either refer patients elsewhere or at least provide information on alternatives. The measure has proved controversial - a small number of clinics sued because they objected to giving referrals or information related to abortion. A judge recently issued a preliminary injunction temporarily preventing the state from enforcing the law against the clinics that sued, according to the Chicago Tribune. Other new health-related laws: Illinois will require insurance coverage for FDA-approved contraceptives Illinois eliminated the tax on feminine hygiene products, often called the “tampon tax” A tax on sweetened beverages will go into effect in the city of Philadelphia, paid by distributors, marking the first time such a tax has been enacted in a major US city More foam bans, more civics lessons San Francisco will implement the country’s widest ban on plastic foam, which environmentalists say can take hundreds of years to degrade. The new law will ban the substance in food products such as meat trays, packing peanuts, ice chests, dock floats and mooring buoys, and even coffee cups. In Tennessee, students will now be required to take a civics test before they graduate from high school. The questions will be similar to those on the US citizenship test, part of a movement to improve Americans’ engagement and understanding of the country’s democratic process.','https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/02/new-us-laws-guns-minimum-wage-domestic-violence','Guns, wages and pot: the new laws taking effect across the US this year',294,'us-news'),('film/2017/jan/02/robin-williams-rejected-for-harry-potter-role-thanks-to-british-only-rule','Robin Williams was eager to play the half-giant gamekeeper Hagrid in the Harry Potter films – but was turned down by producers on account of his nationality. Casting director Janet Hirshenson has confirmed that Williams fell victim to the “Brits-only” rule imposed by producers on the series of films. “Robin had called because he really wanted to be in the movie,” she told the Huffington Post, “but it was a British-only edict, and once he said no to Robin, he wasn’t going to say yes to anybody else, that’s for sure. It couldn’t be.” The part went to Robbie Coltrane, who was reportedly JK Rowling’s first choice for Hagrid. Williams had spoken about his thwarted Potter ambitions, telling the New York Post in 2001: “There were a couple of parts I would have wanted to play, but there was a ban on [using] American actors.” Other key roles for which Williams was considered included leads in The Shining, Philadelphia, Richard Attenborough’s biopic of Charlie Chaplin and Gus van Sant’s film about Harvey Milk. He was also in the running for the part of a depressed professor in Little Miss Sunshine, which eventually went to Steve Carell.

Zaneta Krokova, 11, was run over with her cousin Helina Kotlarova, 12, as they crossed the road holding hands on New Year’s Eve. The 11-year-old had been in a critical condition in hospital since the crash in Oldham, which killed Helina at the scene. Police said Zaneta died in hospital on Monday morning from the injuries she suffered. Sgt Lee Westhead from Greater Manchester police’s serious collision investigation unit said: “This is a heartbreaking incident which has now taken the lives of two young girls and all of our thoughts remain with their families, who are understandably devastated. “We have made significant progress with our investigation since the collision happened and I would like to thank everyone who has contacted police with information so far. “The community are clearly as committed as we are to establishing exactly what happened to Helina and Zaneta and the support they have provided has been vital to the investigation.” Detectives also released pictures of a blue Peugeot 807 estate car they said was involved in the collision, having initially believed a black VW Golf was responsible. Four men – aged 59, 48, 38 and 18 – were arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving and were in custody for questioning. A fifth man, aged 23, initially arrested for the same offence was de-arrested and was assisting police with their inquiries. Police were also trying to trace the driver of a white Citroën Dispatch, which was in the area at the time of the collision on Ashton Road, as they believed he could hold key information. Westhead added: “As the investigation has progressed we have identified that the vehicle that struck the girls was a Blue Peugeot 807. We have recovered this vehicle abandoned on Honeywell Lane. “The Peugeot is very distinctive and I am releasing pictures of the vehicle in an attempt to establish its movements on the 31 December in the hours prior to the collision. “As you can see in the images, the vehicle is dark blue, people carrier-shaped and is in poor physical condition and notably has pre-existing damage to its rear window. “Did you see this vehicle on Saturday 31 December in the hours before or after the collision? “Finally, I am also keen to speak to the occupants of a white Citroën Dispatch van that I am also releasing an image of. This vehicle did not collide with anyone but was in the immediate vicinity of the collision and may have key information. “Again if you saw this vehicle or have any information about its occupants or why it was in the area at the time of the collision, please contact us.” Earlier on Monday fellow Oldham residents appealed to raise £3,000 to help pay for Helina’s funeral. Sallie Lou, who set up the JustGiving page with the approval of Helina’s family, said: “This is a page to help the family of Helina, who sadly lost her life following a collision in Oldham on New Year’s Eve. “This is to help lay Helina to rest, and whatever the family might need. Rest In Peace angel, fly high x.” Helina’s parents, Sylva and Robert, raced to the scene, 100 metres from their home, moments after the girls were hit. Helina’s sister Sylva Kotlarova, 19, described how her mother held the fatally injured 12-year-old and stroked her hair before she was pronounced dead by paramedics. “Her face was all bloody,” she said. “She did not breathe. Mum was touching her hair.” Helina, who has seven sisters and one brother, came to England from the Czech Republic eight years ago, her family told reporters. She attended the Collective Spirit free school in Oldham. Her sister said the girls were with a larger group of family and friends who had already crossed the road, one of the main routes in and out of Oldham town centre, and the larger group was waiting on the opposite pavement. The two cousins then started to cross the road outside the shop. Sylva Kotlarova said: “But as they came to the other side of the road, the car ran them over. They were holding hands.” Seconds later, friends ran to Helina’s home to alert her family. Sylva Kotlarova said: “We ran there. I went to her. She did not breathe. Then the ambulance came.” Bilal Ahmed, who witnessed the aftermath of the collision and dialled 999, told Sky News he had seen the girls outside some shops moments before the crash. “About five minutes later I came back and saw that had happened already on the road,” he said. “One girl was on the right side of the road and the other on the left.” Anyone with any information is asked to call Greater Manchester police’s serious collision investigation unit on 0161 856 4741 quoting incident number 1691 of 31 December 2016.','https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/02/appeal-launched-for-family-of-girl-killed-in-oldham-hit-and-run','Second girl dies after New Year\'s Eve \'hit-and-run\' in Oldham',296,'uk-news'),('football/2017/jan/02/scorpion-kick-henrik-mkhitaryan-olivier-giroud-goals','Anthony Knockaert (Huddersfield v LEICESTER CITY) The winger’s first goal of the game was a wondrous 25-yard effort but his second was even better. Anthony Knockaert, now of Brighton and Hove Albion, nonchalantly flicked the ball past a hapless Alex Smithies in the Huddersfield goal from Paul Konchesky’s cross from the left. Zico (KASHIMA ANTLERS) “The best goal I ever scored, I scored in Japan,” said Zico, the former Brazil midfielder. “I went ahead of the ball, it was coming from behind me and I didn’t know what to do but I threw myself forward to hit the ball with my heel. I got the ball and hit it. It was perhaps the finest piece of play in my entire life.” Festus Baise (Sun Hei v CITIZEN AA) A glorious own goal by Festus Baise, in Hong Kong’s first division. Citizen AA fail to snuff the ball out time and again and eventually Baise does his bit to put his team well and truly out of their misery. The 36-year-old now plays for Chinese side Guizhou Zhicheng. René Higuita (England v COLOMBIA) Think René Higuita, think scorpion kick. The former Colombia goalkeeper wowed the crowd at the old Wembley with his clearance in a friendly against England in 1995. Higuita, nicknamed El Loco, has since been widely crowned the inventor of the scorpion kick. Alexandre Coeff (FRANCE v United States) France’s squad at the Under-20 Toulon Tournament was full of burgeoning talent, including Paul Pogba and Geoffrey Kondogbia, but it was Alexandre Coeff, currently on loan at Ligue 2 Brest, who will be remembered for this moment of magic. Coeff, a centre-back by day, backheeled the ball magnificently beyond the United States goalkeeper from a free-kick. Thomas Luciano (GREMIO U14s v Novo Hamburgo) After some crisp buildup play, with the goal gaping, why sidefoot or hammer it home when you can showboat in front of your team-mates like this? Cue the wild celebrations too. A promising start for young Luciano, at the same Brazilian club where Ronaldinho started his career. Charles-Edouard Coridon (PARIS SAINT-GERMAIN v Porto) The Parc des Princes is quite the footballing arena at the best of times, but it lit up when Charles-Edouard Coridon found the net in considerable style in the Champions League. Coridon got the ball rolling against Porto, with PSG legend Pauleta tapping home a second goal a minute later. It was a moment to cherish for Coridon, who featured just 19 times for the club before moving to Turkish side Ankaragucu. Simon Skrabb (Gefle v ATVIDABERGS FF) How do you make an impression when on loan at a club? Just ask Skrabb, the Finnish youngster who ended up celebrating this strike by covering his face in embarrassment – or pure joy. All of his team-mates joined him, mobbing him to celebrate. Dmytro Ulyanov (AVANHARD KRAMATORSK v Ternopil) Scoring from a scorpion kick is doubtless a fond memory for those fortunate enough to ripple the net in such a fashion – even more so when it’s your first career goal. Dmytro Ulyanov never gives up on this attacking move and he pops up at the far post to the delight of himself and his team-mates. Zlatan Ibrahimovic (PARIS SAINT-GERMAIN v Bastia) Imagine a list of magical goals without even a doff of the cap to Zlatan Ibrahimovic. It’s just not possible. Whether Hervin Ongenda’s flick to Ibrahimovic is intentional or not, the striker manages to find the net during a convincing 4-0 league win. Ibrahimovic hit four goals in a 5-0 win over Anderlecht four days later. Edinson Cavani (NAPOLI v Juventus) Again, at the back post, Edinson Cavani, at speed, flies on to the end of a cross and duly does the honours. The Uruguayan’s goal record at Napoli was impressive – 78 goals in 97 league starts – but few will have felt sweeter than this effort as part of a hat-trick against Juventus at Stadio San Paolo. Carsten Kammlott (Dresden v ERFURT) A spectacular effort, and a scorpion kick, true to its – blurred – definition. Carsten Kammlott celebrates in jubilation, astounded at what he’s just done, after impeccably meeting a cross from the right flank. Ricardo Fernandes (DOXA KATOKOPIAS v Alki Larnaca) Full marks for audacity and accuracy for Ricardo Fernandes, who nestles the ball in the top-right corner with this sublime effort in the Cypriot league. Fernandes has played for 19 clubs in his career – the John Burridge of continental Europe. The 38-year-old is now back in his homeland at Trofense, who play in the Portuguese third tier. Maurício Molina (FC SEOUL v Jeonnam) The cross is floated behind Maurício Molina but he has a trick up his sleeve, and flares go off in the stadium as the Colombian strikes for FC Seoul in the K League. Fredy Guarín (INTERNAZIONALE) Fredy Guarín has moved on to Shanghai Shenhua but goals such as this will always have a place in the hearts of Internazionale supporters. The Colombian replicated the skill shown by his countryman, Higuita, trying his luck after being picked out from the right flank.','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/02/scorpion-kick-henrik-mkhitaryan-olivier-giroud-goals','A celebration of scorpion kicks, from Zico to Zlatan Ibrahimovic',297,'football'),('technology/2017/jan/02/bitcoin-tops-1000-for-first-time-in-three-years-as-2017-trading-begins','Bitcoin has started 2017 with a bang, with its value hitting a three-year high of more than $1,000 (£815). The nascent digital currency, which has been criticised as a vehicle for a range of nefarious characters from drug dealers to tax evaders to operate, outperformed all its central-bank-issued counterparts with a 125% climb in value in 2016. Market watchers have suggested that the soaring value may have been boosted in the past year by increased demand in China on the back of a 7% fall in the value of the yuan; this was the Chinese currency’s weakest annual performance in more than 20 years. Data show most bitcoin trading is done in China, according to Reuters. The currency is used to move money across the globe quickly and anonymously and is free of control from any central bank or government, making it attractive to those who want to get around capital controls. It is also may appeal to those worried about a shortage of cash, as in India where the prime minister, Narendra Modi, removed high-denomination banknotes from circulation in November. “The growing war on cash and capital controls is making bitcoin look like a viable, if high-risk, alternative,” said Paul Gordon, a board member of the UK Digital Currency Association and co-founder of Quantave, a firm that seeks to make it easier for institutional investors to access digital currency exchanges. Bitcoin is still some way off its all-time high of $1,163 reached on the Bitstamp exchange in late 2013, but there are now many more bitcoins in circulation: 12.5 are added to the system every 10 minutes. Its total worth is at a record high of more than $16bn, putting its value at around the same as that of an average FTSE 100 company. During its last surge in 2013, bitcoin boomed as users and speculators rushed to invest in a currency that was supposedly about to become a platform for a disruptive new financial services industry. Its value increased tenfold in two months in late 2013, but after a hack on the Tokyo-based Mt Gox bitcoin exchange it plunged to less than $400 in the following weeks.','https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/02/bitcoin-tops-1000-for-first-time-in-three-years-as-2017-trading-begins','Bitcoin tops $1,000 for first time in three years as 2017 trading begins',298,'technology'),('film/2017/jan/02/ridley-scott-superhero-movies','Ridley Scott, the British director famous for Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator and The Martian, has said he would never direct a superhero movie.

He said he has turned down several offers. “I can’t believe in the thin, gossamer tightrope of the non-reality of the situation of the superhero,” he said. Scott conceded that Blade Runner – the 1982 sci-fi starring Harrison Ford – is not wholly dissimilar to today’s superhero films, but that it boasted elements that they lack. “Blade Runner really is a comic strip when you think about it,” he said. “It’s a dark story told in an unreal world. You could almost put Batman or Superman in that world, that atmosphere, except I’d have a fucking good story, as opposed to no story!” Scott added: “Cinema mainly is pretty bad.” A sequel to Blade Runner, directed by Denis Villeneuve and starring Ryan Gosling, is scheduled for release this year.

Cockerill, ever loyal to the club he joined as a hooker in 1992 and remained at since, apart from a two-year stint at Montferrand to end his playing career, said he respected the decision of the board while believing he was still the best person to be in charge. He was made director of rugby in 2010 after two seasons as head coach, but in the past three years the most successful English club in the professional era have lost ground to Saracens, Bath and Wasps, clubs built on debt rather than, like the Tigers, spending what they earn. “It is with great sadness and regret that I leave my position as director of rugby with immediate effect,” said Cockerill, the third-longest serving in the Premiership following Northampton’s Jim Mallinder and Exeter’s Rob Baxter. “I still believe that I am the right person to lead the team at this present time but respect the board’s decision to make change as they see fit in the best interests of the club. I arrived back at the club in 2004 as an academy coach and leave as director of rugby with a record that speaks for itself and stands up against any in club rugby in the world.” Cockerill was fired because success was in the past and becoming more distant. After reaching the Premiership play-off final for nine consecutive years from 2005, last winning it in 2013, they have missed out in the past three years. Sunday’s defeat to Saracens left them with four victories in their last 17 Premiership matches against the champions, they have won at Wasps once since 2007 and they have lost their last six matches at Bath, conceding 130 points in their last three visits. Away form in recent years has been a concern. They have been overwhelmed at Glasgow and Munster in the Champions Cup this season and the last time they won away in the league against a club that finished in the top four that season was at Northampton in March 2014. Their home form was considerably better, but the loss to a Saracens team missing three England forwards prompted the Leicester board to wish Cockerill good luck. Aaron Mauger, the Tigers’ head coach, will take charge on an interim basis while the board looks at the coaching structure and whether to redefine the role of director of rugby with a greater emphasis on recruitment, one area where Leicester have suffered compared to their rivals in recent seasons: the ability of clubs to sign two marquee players outside the salary cap has left the best supported side in the Premiership and the most financially secure struggling to compete. The mix of Mauger and Cockerill was always going to be intriguing. The former, who played as a centre for New Zealand and finished his career at Leicester, is an exponent of attacking rugby while the latter is steeped in Leicester’s traditional attritional approach. There were signs of disharmony at the beginning of October when the defence coach Scott Hansen, a Kiwi who had arrived with Mauger from the Crusaders in the summer of 2015, was sacked following the concession of three-try bonus points in their first five matches.Leicester have tactically lacked clarity this season, especially away from home, which a long injury list only partly explains. When the Leicester chairman, Peter Tom, responded to criticism of the Tigers in his programme notes on Sunday, he divorced the playing side from the administration. “The performance in Ireland was not what we wanted or expected,” he wrote, “but criticism of the club was well off the mark. We remain in a strong financial positions and continue to invest large sums in support of the players, backroom staff, facilities and our academy. This remains a club with high standards and expectations.” Which is why a league position of fifth with 10 matches to go and trips to Wasps, on Sunday, Bath and Northampton to come, prompted a sacking every bit as painful as that of another club stalwart back in 2004 who also had 23 years of service, Dean Richards. “We are a big club that deserves to be treated with respect,” Cockerill said last month when asked if he feared for his position. “There may be ups and downs on the way, but we will be around in 100 years, doing what we do. Whether I am here or not is irrelevant.”','https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/02/leicester-tigers-part-company-richard-cockerill','Richard Cockerill ‘sadness’ after being sacked by Leicester Tigers',300,'sport'),('sport/2017/jan/02/jamie-george-england-saracens-hooker-dylan-hartley-six-nations','Jamie George rips up the worst cliches about front-row forwards. There was a time when props and hookers were meant to be pug-faced knuckle-draggers who only smiled when remembering the moment they crushed an opponent’s testicles or grunted at an apocryphal story of how they drank a pint of aftershave. Of course the truth about the beefy men of rugby has been different for decades. George grins when I say some of the most illuminating rugby interviews I have done have been with Sean Fitzpatrick and Keith Wood. They made me think the hooker may just be the most intelligent man on the rugby field. “I’d agree with you there,” George says with a wink which sums up his confidence as a hooker who once played at fly-half and as a rugby thinker who turned down an unconditional offer to study at Cambridge. “It is an interesting position,” George continues. “Naturally you have to lead from the front in terms of physicality – and around the field the modern hooker needs to be highly involved. It’s a fascinating balance because you have to compose yourself for lineout throwing which requires mental application and calm. You need to take yourself away from the physical core of the game and get the ball to a precise place. It’s a subtle blend. “The set piece is still the cornerstone but it’s about everything else we do. Dane Coles [the All Blacks hooker] proves that. Coles is fantastic with the ball in hand and when showing his physicality in defence. He’s setting the benchmark.” George’s worldly take on the art of playing hooker captures his mood as he enters a new year. In 2016 he was a key member of the remorseless Saracens squad who won the Premiership and European double. George also became an integral presence in a rejuvenated England squad who won all 13 matches under Eddie Jones – including the Grand Slam, a 3-0 whitewash in Australia and all their autumn internationals. Of course George’s role is complicated. Despite producing the best rugby of his career he has the misfortune of playing in the same position as Dylan Hartley, the man in whom Jones places so much trust as England’s captain. Most pundits argue that, on the pitch, especially in the loose where he can be as skilful as he is dynamic, George has edged ahead of Hartley. But the captain is instrumental to England’s restored belief and George has had to accept coming off the bench and replacing Hartley in the last 20 minutes of a Test. This year, however, brings fresh opportunity. Hartley may also be an intelligent man away from the heat of battle but on the field he has an infamous reputation. Over the years he has been banned for a total of 60 weeks with his latest suspension following another loss of discipline. Last month Hartley had been on the pitch for only six minutes, having come off the bench for Northampton against Leinster, when he cut down Sean O’Brien with a swinging arm. He was fortunate to escape with a six-week ban – and he will be able to play one game for Northampton before England face France at Twickenham in their first Six Nations match on 4 February. Hartley will remain captain but his stupidity has bolstered the layered credentials of George whose increasing importance to England could also translate into selection for the Lions tour of New Zealand this summer. “Yeah,” George says of his Lions prospects, “but anyone from the home countries involved in the Six Nations is in with a shout. There are some good hookers around and two other captains of their country. Rory Best [Ireland’s captain]. Ross Ford has also led Scotland. But, if I play well, hopefully I will be in selection talks. The more opportunities I get the better. I love playing for England and it’s great to get the opportunity and to make the most of it.” He is canny enough to downplay a suggestion that Hartley’s latest mistake may represent a last chance for England’s captain and give George even more belief he can nail down a Test starting place. “I don’t know. No, I wouldn’t say that really. I never really think too much about selection. And I don’t want to think too much about international stuff while I’m here.” George gestures to Allianz Park where we sit after Saracens have completed another long training session. “You can drag yourself into a vicious cycle and end up thinking ahead and not about the task at hand. You get distracted and your performances go down. John Smit [who led South Africa to victory in the 2007 World Cup before joining Saracens] always told me to focus on what’s next and not what might happen in February. I have a huge game on the weekend [against Exeter who lost to Saracens in the Premiership final last season] and it’s another chance to impress.” One of the more intriguing asides to his rivalry with Hartley is that the captain seems to value George’s opinion more than most. “We have a very good working relationship and get on really well,” George says. “Dylan will ask my opinion on how sessions have gone. I think he respects my opinion. I’ve got a bit of leadership under my belt and one of my strengths is my knowledge of the game. He just wants to talk to me about it. But he talks to a lot of people because that’s what good captains do. And Dylan is a good captain.” George has the intelligence to always be included in debate about the game and, here, he cites Smit’s influence. “I played a full season with John at prop and he was hugely important. He would talk to me in the game and say: ‘How do we think this is going?’ John gave me so much time and I wouldn’t be where I am today without him. He came over for the South Africa game [when England won easily and George replaced Hartley after 56 minutes]. John was very happy for me. It’s a bit surreal to be friends with a legend.” But the presence of Smit and Schalk Brits, another fine South Africa hooker, tested George at Saracens. For a few seasons he was third-choice behind those two masters. George shakes his head when asked if he has always been patient. “No. I’ve had to learn patience. It was very frustrating because I found a way into the first team quickly – one year after school. I then had a year with John playing with me at prop. But he switched back to hooker so after almost three years of first-team rugby I became third choice. In that frustrating time I changed my attitude and became more effective off the bench. I realised I can’t have five minutes easing myself into the game. I had to make my mark quickly. “I still rotate with Schalk but this season I’ve definitely started more. It’s 60-40 in my favour. But there’s a lot to be said for serving an apprenticeship and learning under these guys … as long as it doesn’t go on for too long.” The essence of George is captured when he is asked if he was tempted to leave Saracens for a less competitive environment? “No, no. I grew up supporting Saracens and I’d love to be a one-club man. I have signed a long-term contract and will be here a long, long time.” The culture of Saracens changed with the appointment of another South African, Brendan Venter, in 2009 – the year George and some of his current team-mates at club and international level joined the academy. George, Owen Farrell and George Kruis were part of an academy team which included Will Fraser and Jackson Wray who remain part of the Saracens squad today. “It’s like the Man United academy which was so strong [with Giggs, Beckham, Scholes, Butt and the Neville brothers]. Our club values are perfect for someone aspiring to be a professional or a great international. We had a special year with those guys and we were hugely motivated. We won the European Under-17 tournament and then played together in the second team.” George and Farrell have combined to spectacular effect for England – most notably when the hooker produced a sumptuous little offload to set up his friend’s try against Italy in 2015 and, last year, after a deft little grubber kick from George allowed Farrell to score against Australia in the series-clincher in Melbourne. “We’ve played together a long time,” George says. “Since we were 14. We’ve got a brilliant relationship. We’re best friends so we feed off each other. Owen does most of the creating but I like to try. We’re very close after playing county rugby together and also against each other when we were 13. I was a fly-half then. I guess that’s where I learnt about grubber kicks.” Was George a good No10? “No! I was terrible. Dreadful. I grew up playing in the backs but moved to No8 and then hooker at 14. I always knew I’d end up there but it was important for my development to play fly-half and centre. You had the ball in your hands a lot and fly-halves are important in terms of leadership. I wasn’t very good but I learned a huge amount.” Jones was at Saracens when George and Farrell were at the academy. “I was still at school but I played a pre-season game against Western Force when Eddie was there. I was also coached by Eddie at the academy and he stood out as a strong character. He had an aura and you had to be on it. He was always very good, like now, in flicking the switch. He can have a joke with you but then it’s time to work. That’s serious.” Steve Borthwick, George’s former captain at Saracens is now England’s forwards’ coach, in another link binding the hooker’s past and present. “I played for Steve for five years,” the 26-year-old remembers. “He’s hugely intelligent and a brilliant man. I always knew he’d become a great coach.” Do Jones and Borthwick keep in touch with him outside of international matches? “You get texts here and there but in camp they talk about games you played four weeks ago. So you know they’re always watching and you want to impress them every week.” That aspiration is sure to be even sharper this year and George cannot hide his enthusiasm when remembering watching England at Twickenham with his dad as a kid and following the Lions from 1997 with fierce passion. He also tells me about having moved in with his girlfriend Katie Stanyard and his mastery of cooking a sausage&nbsp;pasta bake the night before a big game when, he grins, “you need to pack in the carbs”. George is the most versatile hooker in English rugby and 2017 could be an even better year for him. “Definitely. Hard work pays off and this is the hardest I’ve ever worked in my life. Eddie was a big factor in me seeing that everything you do has a consequence. My mentality now is that I need to finish the day a better player than I started. I’m getting there.”','https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/02/jamie-george-england-saracens-hooker-dylan-hartley-six-nations','Jamie George: ‘Dylan Hartley talks to people because he’s a good captain’',301,'sport'),('tv-and-radio/2017/jan/02/will-and-grace-returning-leslie-jordan-nbc','Will &amp; Grace, the hit sitcom about the romantic highs and lows of two New York friends, is reportedly returning for 10 episodes on US network NBC. Leslie Jordan, who guested on the show as the character Beverley Leslie, said in a radio interview: “It’s back. Here’s the way it works: NBC has ordered 10 episodes. It’ll be for next season, so they’ll [film] in July.” NBC is yet to confirm the show’s return. After running for eight seasons between 1998 and 2006, the show returned with a 10-minute episode in September 2016, with the titular pair discussing Donald Trump’s presidential nomination. Asked then about a more long-form return for the show, Eric McCormack, who plays Will, said “it’s a never say never type of situation”. Will &amp; Grace was unusual in the late 1990s with its frank – if rather stereotyped – depiction of gay romance. Outgoing vice-president Joe Biden once said: “I think Will &amp; Grace probably did more to educate the American public [on gay people] than almost anything anybody has ever done so far.” By its third season it was attracting over 17m viewers an episode, and netted guest stars including Woody Harrelson, Minnie Driver and Alec Baldwin. Debbie Reynolds, who died last week after a stroke, appeared in every season as Grace’s mother Bobbi.

Wildlife experts are submitting a licence application to release 10 beavers in the south of the country and hope the reintroduction could begin this year. The Scottish government recently decided to list beavers as a protected species after a successful trial reintroduced the animals into the wild, and a pair were also released on the Otter river in Devon in May. The animals were hunted to extinction in Britain in the 16th century, but the five-year Scottish beaver trial established a group in Knapdale Forest in Argyll. Another population emerged on the Tay river following illegal releases a decade ago. In England, beaver numbers on the Otter have increased, with two established pairs producing offspring, or kits. One female produced five kits, well above the average of three, the programme’s manager, Mark Elliot, said. A new male and female released on the Otter in May to increase the genetic diversity of England’s only wild beaver population have also settled in well, he said. Beavers have been living wild on the Otter for up to a decade, but are now part of an official five-year trial by Devon Wildlife Trust. “They have been very visible, people have been able to watch them. We’ve had a lot of people down here beaver watching in the summer,” Elliott said. “That’s been benefiting the local pubs and B&amp;Bs, and people are talking about ‘beaver tourism’, which is really encouraging.” Alicia Leow-Dyke, the Welsh beaver project officer for the Wildlife Trusts Wales, said there would now be a public consultation. A first application was made to Natural Resources Wales a year ago. If the application is not opposed, the project hopes to start releasing animals in 2017. Leow-Dyke said: “The evidence coming from Britain and Europe is they can be beneficial for ecology, helping with reducing flooding and filtering water, and have important consequences for the landscape.” The beavers could help with habitat restoration, bringing light into overgrown areas and allowing other nature to thrive, she said. “With the beaver you’re not looking at a single species. It can have such a wider benefit helping the ecosystem. Because we’ve had such a detrimental effect on the landscape for so long, this can help,” she said. Farmers and anglers have argued that beavers damage the landscape and affect fish migration, and have called for conservation efforts to be focused on the UK’s existing wildlife. Leow-Dyke said there was evidence from Europe that beavers’ negative impacts could be managed and the scheme would have a net benefit. The enjoyment factor of seeing the creatures in the wild and easy-to-spot field signs of their presence could be used to encourage children to explore the natural world, she said. Liz Halliwell, a mammal ecologist at Natural Resources Wales, said beavers were once part of the country’s native wildlife and could create rich and varied habitats that made the environment stronger and healthier. But she added: “Our assessment of any application for a licence would need to carefully consider the effects of a reintroduction on existing wildlife and land use.”','https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/02/beavers-could-be-reintroduced-to-wales-after-centuries-absence','Beavers could be reintroduced to Wales after centuries\' absence',303,'environment'),('technology/2017/jan/02/seasteading-peter-thiel-french-polynesia','A futuristic plan to build a floating techno-libertarian city in a French Polynesian lagoon has left some local residents worried they could be the next unsuspecting inhabitants of a peaceful planet in a science-fiction movie. “It reminds me of the innocent Ewoks of the moon of Endor who saw in the Galactic Empire a providential manna,” said Tahitian TV host Alexandre Taliercio. “They let them build what they wanted on earth and in orbit, but that’s not to say that the Empire shared the blueprints of the Death Star with them.” The proposal for a seastead – an autonomous oceanic colony; think homesteading, but wetter - took a significant step on Christmas Day, when a Silicon Valley group announced it had reached an agreement with the French Polynesian government, with officials poised to explore serving as the group’s host. Seasteaders said it was a breakthrough that could change the world, but Taliercio worried that rich Americans simply wanted to use his home to dodge taxes. “These millionaires,” he said, “lulled by an illusory desire to free themselves from the existing states, seem to have much more to gain than we do.” The idea of seasteading – escaping the laws, regulations, and taxes of life on terra firma by establishing an outpost in international waters – has long enchanted libertarians. “The question of whether seasteading is possible or desirable is in my mind not even relevant. It is absolutely necessary,” the billionaire PayPal founder Peter Thiel said at a 2009 seasteading conference. After Thiel helped launch the Seasteading Institute with a $500,000 investment, seasteading became the movement of the moment in Silicon Valley, where regulation and government bureaucracy are anathema and the billionaire’s success as an investor – his current fortune is largely due to his early stake in Facebook – has given him the reputation of a visionary. The logistical and financial challenges of establishing a colony in international waters, however, proved steep. So this year the Seasteading Institute began negotiations with French Polynesia, which is a part of France, but has significant autonomy. On 30 November, French Polynesia’s cabinet gave president Edouard Fritch a mandate, and he will travel to San Francisco in January to sign an agreement to develop a “special governing framework” for “seazones”, according to Randolph Hencken, the Seasteading Institute’s executive director. Hencken said by email that the agreement stipulated that the institute must prove that seasteading will provide economic benefits and not harm the environment, and that the government will not provide any subsidies. “Our seasteading collaboration with French Polynesia was initiated by the Tahitians themselves and will bring jobs, economic growth, and environmental resiliency to the region,” Hencken said. Hencken predicts a close relationship between the seastead and the islands. In an interview with Business Insider in October, he suggested that he would be able to take a speedboat to French Polynesia to take yoga classes and go to restaurants. The islands would also provide a construction base, he said, further reducing costs. While Hencken argued that seasteading would be a boon for French Polynesia, exemption from taxes is a key factor in the seasteading movement. In his 2009 speech, Thiel argued that “anything that can be done to create much larger numbers of countries will be very good”, largely because the proliferation of nations would drive down marginal tax rates. “If we want to increase freedom, we want to increase the number of countries.” It is that attitude that draws the suspicion of local residents like Taliercio, who questioned whether “facilitating the tax evasion of the world’s greatest fortunes” would be healthy for South Pacific nations. “I grew up in what is for the rest of the world a terrestrial paradise, but I can testify today that the other side of the picture is not glorious and makes me sad,” Taliercio said. “The unemployment rate is distressing; the impoverishment of the population is palpable everywhere; our social protection system is in deficit and is in peril.” Indeed, French Polynesia’s GDP is just $5.6bn, or about the equivalent of two Peter Thiels. Alexandre Le Quéré, a Tahitian radio journalist, poked fun at the idea on Polynésie 1ère, a local media outlet. He quipped that proponents of the “futuristic delirium” of seasteading wanted a “Noah’s Ark to the Wall Street gravy”. Le Quéré also expressed concern that the project could produce “chaos” for the local population. Hervé Raimana Lallemant-Moe, a researcher in international and environmental law at the Université de la Polynésie Française, pointed out that the island nation was “particularly vulnerable” due to its isolation, size, economy, and the threat of climate change, and that the population was generally opposed to large projects on environmental grounds. “It is clear that the people do not think that the creation of artificial islands should be a priority,” he said. The president’s office declined to comment on the plan to the Guardian, but a statement cited the potential for economic development as a benefit to the country. The government also mentioned the importance of “the presence of serious investors” and named Thiel as a backer. Thiel’s spokesman told the Guardian that he was not “involved in the French Polynesia seasteading efforts”. Marc Collins, a Tahitian businessman and former minister of tourism, said that the negative reaction to the project was to be expected. “Tahitians are sick and tired and hearing of these mega, massive projects that go nowhere,” he said. “There is a predisposition of the population to be very cautious.” But Collins, who invited the Seasteading Institute to consider French Polynesia after reading about the group’s attempts to find a host country in Wired, said he believed the project was in the best interest of his country, was much smaller than the mega-projects, and would not involve government subsidies. Collins hopes that the seastead will boost the economy, bring the country into more contact with technological innovators in Silicon Valley, and help combat the “brain drain” that sees educated Tahitians leave the islands in search of work. “If anyone knows how to live on the oceans it’s Tahitians,” he said. “Polynesians are the original seasteaders.”','https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/02/seasteading-peter-thiel-french-polynesia','Seasteading: tech leaders\' plans for floating city trouble French Polynesians',304,'technology'),('news/2017/jan/02/2017-big-ideas-part-two-northern-labour-party-fighting-cancer','Publishing Authentic voices and undiluted stories By Jonny Geller The great thing about living through such a turbulent year as 2016 is that all bets are off in terms of what people will want to read in 2017. All we thought we knew about how people think, receive news and trust authority has changed. This must, and will, have a direct impact on what stories we want to read. Will it lead to more escapism? Or, conversely, will we seek complexity and disruption to make sense of the new order? After the first world war, modernism sprang up, and after 11 September there was an explosion of superhero franchise movies. Big moments in history are reflected back on us through our culture. Fear is always a good starting point. On television, Westworld, Humans and Mr Robot all showed up our fears of a world run by artificial intelligence or by computers out of control. Culture reflects our deepest fears, so I imagine publishing will be looking for worlds where our deepest desires, fears and impulses are released; where repressed forces come to the fore. Publishing, like Hollywood, is intensely reactive. Something unlikely will become a success and then define the next wave. Dan Brown caught the wave of uncertainty post 9/11 with thrillers that linked us back to a mythical past, unlocking secrets to reveal more about who we thought we were. Gillian Flynn, Paula Hawkins and even EL James unlocked our darkest, most intimate feelings about our own domestic arrangements. I think the next big idea will be a move toward authentic voices and experiences. I think people will want undiluted stories that reflect their lives, experiences and emotions, unfiltered. I believe, too, that voices from outside the urban centres will push their way through the white, middle-class wall of London publishing. Alongside this, there is also growing evidence of more hyperrealism, and satires being written; of naturalism (similar to the wave in theatre in late-19th century) where big issues will be explored in a recognisable setting. I am very excited by possibilities of 2017 as writers reflect the changes in narrative form.

UK politics The rise of a northern Labour party By John Harris A statement of the bleeding obvious, to start with. The Labour party is in a mess: apparently sliding towards the mid-20s in the polls, reeling from its poor showing in recent byelections, and riven by a split between supporters of Jeremy Corbyn and many Labour MPs. Most of all, it is spooked by what happened in the EU referendum, when most of its traditional “core” areas voted for Brexit, highlighting both the cultural gap between the party’s supposed heartlands – south Wales and the north of England – and the potential threat to Labour from Ukip, and/or the “people’s movement” that will be launched in the new year by the Brexit mega-donor Arron Banks. So far, this tension hasn’t been reflected in any clear factional divides inside the party, but in 2017 that will change. In May, there will be a handful of elections for England’s new metropolitan mayors, including a contest in Greater Manchester. There, Labour’s dead-cert candidate is the twice-failed leadership candidate Andy Burnham, who has decided to call time on his Westminster career and have a crack at leading a swath of the country with a population of 2.8 million. And in the buildup to the campaign, with the tacit support of some MPs, he has come up with a new definition of what he wants to represent: “Northern Labour” – which, he says, “needs to speak very directly to people and represent them properly in terms of the way [they] think and feel”. This does not take much decoding. While Corbyn and his inner circle have rejected any calls for Labour to sound tougher on immigration, Burnham has been on manoeuvres, controversially claiming that Labour’s stance is undermining “the safety of our streets” and the vote to leave the EU was partly about “more control in our immigration system”. What he and his allies are aiming at is pretty clear: an offshoot of the Labour party that will try to reconnect with its lost territories, will often speak with a self-consciously working-class voice and brazenly position itself against London. How this will sit with a cosmopolitan, 21st-century city such as Manchester remains unclear. But be in no doubt: in contrast to the Corbyn version, a different vision of Labour’s future is about to take root 200 miles from the capital, with big political consequences.

Fashion All hail Statue of Liberty green By Jess Cartner-Morley We have passed peak avocado, but the colour wheel has not spun far. The shade of 2017 will be Statue of Liberty green. The colour came into focus in September, when the New Yorker ran a lyrical piece in praise of New York City’s “secret, sustaining colour”. Soon, the colour was everywhere: in the high-necked, floor-length dress that opened the Emilia Wickstead show at London fashion week; painted on the walls at the JW Anderson show. In naming the wasabi-hued “greenery” its symbolic colour of 2017, Pantone championed the power of green “to provide us with the reassurance we yearn for amid a tumultuous social and political environment”. In nature, green represents hope and renewal. Our green, however, is a touch more complicated. At a time when US politics has become larger than life, breaking out of its Washington bubble to touch every part of popular culture, Statue of Liberty green is a political colour. That the copper statue had turned from brown to green within 20 years of its unveiling in 1886 means that this colour stands for change and the unstoppability of decay. So, while the symbol is everywhere – the Starbucks logo, if you ask me, although they are coy about it – it can stand for despair as well as pride. In the aftermath of November’s election, a crying Statue of Liberty, and riffs on the Planet of the Apes image of the statue half-buried in the sand, became popular anti-Trump memes on social media. Statue of Liberty green is a colour that no one planned – indeed, when the oxidisation process became evident, politicians argued over whether a paint job was called for – and that changed our landscape. It is the colour of endurance and of change. It stands for “American values” and for liberal ones. (The inscription on the pedestal, after all, includes the lines: “Give me your tired, your poor / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.”) It is a colour nobody saw coming, and one that represents conflicting views. What could be more 2017? Jess Cartner-Morley is the Guardian’s associate editor, fashion. Cancer Immunology brings successes and sobering news By Siddhartha Mukherjee Can the human body be taught to reject cancer cells? The biggest idea in cancer this year – and perhaps the most exhilarating idea in all of medicine – was that a dormant immune system could be roused to attack cancer. It is an idea with a tortured history. In the 1890s, William Coley, a New York scientist and surgeon, had proposed injecting cancer patients with a mixture of bacterial toxins (called Coley’s toxins) to elicit an immune response that would attack cancer cells. But Coley’s initial results were hard to interpret and reproduce, and enthusiasm for the toxins waned. When I began to study immunology at Oxford in the 1990s, the field of cancer immunology was, frankly, languishing in neglect. In the late 90s, however, the discipline took a surprising turn: scientists working on the immune system (led, particularly, by the visionary immunologist James Allison) began to discover that some tumour cells expressed specific factors to inactivate the immune system or render themselves invisible to immune cells. These invisibility proteins offered an opportunity for a counter-attack: specific factors were created to inactivate these cloaking signals so that tumours would become visible again. The first such drugs were deployed against melanomas, and some patients showed durable responses, albeit with severe side-effects. Since those initial trials, dozens of strategies to activate the immune system have been discovered, and fleets of new immunomodulatory drugs have appeared in the clinic. In another twist on the same theme, a patient’s own immune cells were brought out of the body, manipulated with gene therapy to arm them to attack cancer cells, and reintroduced to the patient. These cells grow in the body once reintroduced, making them exemplars of a new generation of “living drugs”, as Michel Sadelain, one of the pioneers of this strategy, has described them. Immunotherapy for cancer has had some sentinel successes – notably against melanoma, lung cancer, lymphomas and some leukemias. But this year also brought sobering news about unexpected side-effects of these drugs: patients suffered inexplicable fevers or life-threatening colitis. Broader questions about efficacy and cost remain. Are these drugs going to be useful to treat only a small fraction of tumours? How much will they cost – and can that be contained? One strange effect of immunotherapy is that tumours can often swell and become larger during the early course of treatment, as immune cells infiltrate the tumours and create inflammation. For decades, the traditional metric to judge tumour responsiveness was to measure the size of the tumour – yet here the cancers seemed to grow before some of them finally responded to the therapy. Will traditional metrics of tumour responsiveness need to be re-evaluated with immunotherapy? How will we understand why and when these cancers relapse – and can the immune system be retrained, over and over, to attack such perennially evolving cancers?

Restaurants The rise of regional bistro culture By Angela Hartnett London is not the centre of the universe any more, and what we are seeing and – I hope – will continue to see is more chefs moving out of the city and encouraging the growth of local restaurants, which can have positive effects on places and communities, and which increase access to good, affordable food. Gary Usher has done this really well with Sticky Walnut in Chester. Then, he crowdfunded the next two – Burnt Truffle on the Wirral and now Hispi in south Manchester. They are affordable little bistros that do really well. Mitch Tonks is doing it brilliantly, too. He started with The Seahorse in Dartmouth and has opened Rockfish restaurants in seaside towns. And if someone starts it off, other things happen – so there’s now a crab festival and a food festival in Dartmouth. It happened in Abergavenny, too, starting with the Walnut Tree. We should have affordable restaurants throughout the country. But to make a restaurant work as a business, you have to be busy on a wet Tuesday night, not just twice a week. That’s hard to do, but with a bit of effort and imagination, it is possible. Angela Hartnett is a chef and chef-patron at Murano, her Michelin-starred restaurant in London. Geopolitics A new ideological spectrum By Chris Anderson We have just ended a year of political shock. Thanks to Brexit and Trump, the comfy consensus around an ever-more global, tech-powered world delivering bounty to all has been blown up. And the old political left-right spectrum has been replaced by a new spectrum. Some would sneeringly call it that of tribal v global, xenophobic v embracing, backward v forward. But there is a more generous, more productive, framing: protect v connect. From that standpoint, the mistake made by the political/capitalist status quo these past years has been that in rushing towards an ever-more connected world, we failed to protect. We let millions of people come to fear the loss of their jobs, their dreams, and the cultural norms with which they were familiar. And in the process, aided by an out-of-control social media landscape, we have become disgusted by each other. We urgently need new ways to find common ground and recreate a vision for the future worth pursuing. The jolt has been dramatic enough that it has sparked numerous ideas to help achieve this. At a minimum, it’s going to take: ⇾ An assault on fake news. The knowledge era needs knowledge, not clickbait. Look for new, self-correcting systems that tap into crowd wisdom, not mob-powered rumour-mongering. ⇾ A vision for the future of meaningful work for humans in a world filled by increasingly intelligent agents. ⇾ Education reforms that prepare our kids to thrive in that future. ⇾ New economic ideas, such as universal basic income. ⇾ A new articulation of globalist thinking. It should not be driven by faceless global elites, but by individuals connecting with each other across the planet and discovering just how much we can learn from each other. Once we can start listening to each other again, there is a real discussion to be had on how we avoid sleepwalking into a future that humanity can’t handle. We want to be amazed and delighted. But not to lose our souls in the process. Let’s get that conversation rebooted!

Human rights An app to record abuse anonymously By Helena Kennedy I co-chair the International Bar Association’s Institute of Human Rights, which champions the rule of law and human rights around the world. Next year, we shall launch a fabulous new tool that will help in the pursuit of justice for breaches of human rights. It will make it possible, for those who witness horrifying events, to film and document them and then send them to an archive for use as evidence in trials. The phone app, for which the IBA director, Mark Ellis, found the funding, will allow people to film ghastly stuff and then send the footage directly to a repository. The time and location coordinates of filming will be attached at the time, helping to later validate the film. The immediate depositing of the film means there can be no accusations of tampering or editing. A second tap of the app will remove the film from the phone that was used to make the recording, so that the owner cannot be caught in possession of incriminating material. This development came as a result of people sending anonymous film to news outlets; without authentication of place and time and proof of non-interference, the IBA has been struggling with the issue of admissibility of such evidence in a court of law. This will be an exciting development that will help prove that abuses happen all too often. Another sign of hope for 2017: people are sensibly talking about the creation of progressive alliances to combat the ghastly politics of this government. We should all see that this is the way to go.

Scientific research Gene editing brings a world of extraordinary possibilities By Henry Marsh I wouldn’t be so bold as to predict any immediate big breakthroughs in medical neuroscience, but in an increasingly depressing and frightening world, I derive great pleasure, solace and a sense of wonder from the constant advance of science. One of the great things about science is that it turns up ideas and solutions that are novel, and sometimes unexpected – and I find that spiritually uplifting in a very worrying world politically, socially and environmentally. Who would have thought that Parkinson’s disease is probably caused by gut bacteria, or that a feathered dinosaur tail would be found in a piece of amber, preserved for 99m years? These are both recent discoveries. Then there are the extraordinary opportunities that Crispr gene-editing technology has opened and the potential for it to help us defeat a whole range of incurable illnesses. Of course, what is desperately needed is an effective cure or prevention for Alzheimer’s, and a lot of people are working extremely hard on that. I think a lot of non-scientists struggle to understand that there is a deep spiritual and mystical element to science, just as there is in mathematics. A good mathematical proof is elegant, an object of aesthetic beauty that appeals to a deep level of the psyche. The idea of a division between the emotional and the rational is totally false. Doctors think with feelings rather than in terms of pure abstract, dispassionate processes; we are not calculating machines. This helps because it helps fuel progress in science, which is unstoppable - and it has to be. I don’t want to be Pollyanna-ish about it, but I think we have to be positive about the future because if we’re not, bad things will certainly happen. If we think the future is bound to be awful, we won’t do anything about it. We have to think positively and act positively rather than be carried away with despair.

Alliances are under strain. Pax Americana looks like a thing of the past. Civil wars – most fuelled by outsiders – are consuming the Middle East. Europe is facing a series of crises. And terrorists continue to wreak havoc wherever they can. Meanwhile, markets will be driven up and down as much by Donald Trump’s impulsive tweets as by economic reality. President Putin will continue to exploit signs of weakness or western disunity. China will react as China always does to perceived – or real – slights. In the UK, Brexiters are still enjoying bayonetting the corpses of their opponents, but know that they too will have to face reality in 2017. Resolving the contradictions within the government’s various positions, and preventing backbench revolts destroying its slim parliamentary majority, will be all-consuming. Elsewhere in Europe, France and Germany will be consumed by their own elections while in Hungary and Poland respect for democracy and the rule of law is under threat. So, at a time of worrying global instability, there is unlikely to be much focus on international affairs by what we used to call the free world – and if that sounds like overreaction to the events of 2016, take a look at what the losing Republican governor of North Carolina just did to prevent his successor getting on with the job when he takes over in January. But it’s precisely because governments are distracted or incapacitated that there is a role for non-state actors. America always has a wealth of talented people waiting in the wings, or in thinktanks, while a president of the opposing party occupies the White House. Out of office, they undertake specialist missions, sometimes solo and sometimes in bipartisan groups, to address the big foreign and security policy issues of the day. Congress does the same thing, invariably obtaining high-level access for traveling congressional delegations (CoDels), as do the UK parliament’s select committees. The private channels established in this way can be of great value. The first two years of negotiations with Iran culminating in the 2015 nuclear deal, for example, were conducted below the radar by US officials and then senator, later secretary of state, John Kerry. For years, Track Two diplomacy of this kind has helped ensure that the US and Russian governments understand each other even when official relations are strained. Today we have to confront uncertainty and unpredictability, fear, populist nationalism being whipped up and exploited by so-called strongmen, and the use of social media – described in a recent Washington Post editorial as “a neutral host body for parasitical insanity” – to spread fake facts. This would be a dangerous combination even if America was not in transition and other governments were capable of pulling together to manage the risks. But it is, and they aren’t. Political figures could help too, though like the financiers whose greed brought the world’s financial system to its knees in 2008 and left others to pick up the tab, some might do better to keep their heads down and carry on making large sums on the lecture circuit. Here in Britain, a large minority continues to believe that calling and then losing the EU referendum last June was the greatest act of political irresponsibility of modern times. The need for other players to help take the strain is clear enough. But it shouldn’t be left to the United States. America has immense reserves of talent, but it also has baggage, like the other once Great Powers. There are businessmen, academics, retired generals and former diplomats from many other countries with long experience and trusted relationships built up over many years who can and should come together, in a genuinely transatlantic or perhaps global way, with a view to looking strategically at the facts, assessing trends and risks, and warning the public and political leaders when danger lies ahead and how to avoid it. Respected policy centers and thinktanks on both sides of the Atlantic are beginning to think along these lines. Their work will be all the more valuable if governments come to realize how absorbed they are with their own domestic concerns and that they could do with a helping hand.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/02/save-global-liberalism-look-beyond-government','To save global liberalism, time to look beyond government | Peter Westmacott',306,'commentisfree'),('world/2017/jan/02/women-politics-us-election','Victoria Oliver has been a police officer for 20 years, the last 10 as a detective, but it didn’t take a Sherlock Holmes instinct for her to deduce that it was time for her to run for political office. “The election was so divisive. You can take the easy option and sit on the sidelines and criticize, or you can get involved and try to change things,” she said. The surprise victory of Donald Trump in November was the clincher. “They’ve picked a petulant boy to run our nation, instead of this incredible woman who was such a force and won the popular vote,” she said. Oliver, a member of the Denver police department, will embark on a training course this January aimed at preparing her to become a candidate in future local, state or national elections. She is part of a surge of women across the country who are rushing to run for office in the aftermath of the election – women disappointed that Hillary Clinton lost and disgusted with the sexist and racist rhetoric of Trump’s campaign and the ultra-conservative credentials of his proposed cabinet. “We are a force to be reckoned with,” said Oliver. “Our time is coming.” VoteRunLead (VRL), an organization that trains future female politicians, normally receives between 30 and 80 applicants for each of its regular webinars. “In a 48-hour period after the election, we had 1,100 women sign up for our next webinar and we had to close it and start a wait list,” said Erin Vilardi, executive director of VoteRunLead. “Most women said they woke up on November 9 and realized they could no longer just spectate or click on online petitions, they wanted to know how to run for office, whether it’s the school board, the city council, state or national representation,” she added. VRL is a non-partisan organization and women signing up are not asked whether they intend to run as Democrats or Republicans. The main theme of the new influx could be summed up as “a rejection of Trump”, Vilardi said. Two-thirds of existing VRL members who state an affiliation are Democrats. Other organizations that specifically aim to put Democratic women in power, such as Emily’s List and Emerge America, are also reporting a dramatic spike in interest from women. In Maryland, Eve Hurwitz, 44, had thought about entering politics before but had been concerned at her lack of experience. “My degree is in music and my career is in business and the military. But when Trump won, I thought: ‘He isn’t qualified either and he’s going to be president,’” she said. Hurwitz is a naval flight officer who served as a mission commander flying in an airborne early warning aircraft during combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. She was based on the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise and switched from active duty to the reserve in 2010. She is now a financial software consultant. “Trump tipped me over the edge. I thought: what’s stopping me?” She is training with VRL and wants to become a candidate for state lawmaker in Maryland “within six to 12 months”, she said, or perhaps even go straight for national office in 2018. Emerge America, a progressive political coaching group, reported almost 800 women signed up for different aspects of their training courses since the election, exponentially more than normal. One of its courses had 35 women sign up in the six weeks before the election - and 230 in the six weeks after. Emily’s List, which focuses on getting pro-choice, Democratic women into office and offers one-on-one training, reported that it usually put a lot of resources into scouting women suitable for politics, but now those women were coming to them. “We have seen an unprecedented number of women raising their hands, wanting to run,” said Denise Feriozzi, deputy executive director of Emily’s List. She said Emily’s List had an eye on state governor races coming up in 2018. “We’ve had a lot of success in getting women elected to Congress but there are only two Democratic women governors in the country,” said Feriozzi. Jenny Willford, 30, knows some of what it will take. She narrowly failed to win a local open seat on the outskirts of Denver in 2015, losing to a fellow Democrat and male party stalwart at least twice her age. “I have stories for days about the sexist stuff I heard. I was told I should have asked his permission and that it was his ‘turn’. Then a voter told me I should be home taking care of my child and baking apple pie – literally. I was called a bitch,” she said. She is currently weighing whether to run again and meanwhile is running Emerge Colorado, a branch of Emerge America. Oliver, 50, will enter Emerge Colorado’s training course in January with plans to run for city or state office in two to five years. She became a cop to try to improve community race relations “and because growing up I didn’t see officers like me. I knew black women were there, but I wasn’t seeing them on the beat,” she said. She takes pride in bridging divides. Oliver said she had a lot of respect for the Black Lives Matter movement and had close friends who were ardent supporters of the grassroots organization that emerged from public outrage over the deaths of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and a string of unarmed black men killed by law enforcement. “When these things occur, I tell people I’m not going to attack the officer because I’m black and I’m not going to defend them because I’m a cop,” she said. Oliver believes that the vast majority of police officers are sound and well intentioned. When there is a bad officer or a terrible mistake, the authorities need to “hear the whole story, examine it and fix it”, she said. One of her tenets is good communication. “Everyone starts on the same page of respect with me, including suspects. But if they drop that I can drop it very fast, too,” she said. She worries that people have lost faith in the power of their vote in the US and that politicians have stopped listening to the people. Fayrouz Saad, an Arab American and a Muslim woman, sees “a void” in Congress and state legislatures of young, minority faces. Saad, 33, has already been through the Emerge Michigan political training program. She works in the Detroit mayor’s office and has a master’s degree in public administration from Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. “I had this moment of clarity after the election that rather than hoping someone else steps in, why shouldn’t I?” she said. “I want to run as soon as possible.” During the campaign, relatives of hers were told by people they didn’t know: “I can’t wait for Donald Trump to deport you.” She is interested in immigrants’ rights and women’s rights but also income inequality and improving public education. “When I was in fifth grade I told my teacher I wanted to be the first woman president,” she said. “Why not? Why not me? Why not continue to work my butt off in the hope I could be secretary of state one day? President? I would like to think that one day America could vote for a Muslim American woman and if not me, then someone.” • This article was amended on 1 January 2017.

It can make an unperceivable number of calculations a second. This outstanding ability is widely implemented during one of the most neurologically challenging actions people are engaged with on a daily basis: driving. Several areas of the brain act in collaboration in order to receive, process, prioritise and implement real-time data perceived during driving. These complex processes may pass unnoticed by the driver, but their uninterrupted functioning is crucial. The difference between life and death might be determined by a delay of only 100 milliseconds in response time. At high speeds, this micro timeframe can translate into several feet, which may in turn be the difference between avoiding danger and a fatal crash. Such a minor delay may be caused by any minimal distraction: a sudden noise, a quick glance at the phone or a random thought. So what I am most excited about for 2017 is the groundbreaking invention that has the ability to minimise these dangers and potentially save millions of lives on the road: driverless cars. We are getting closer than we thought, faster than we imagined, to having mass production of safe and reliable driverless cars. Many people have heard about this innovation, but not many realise how fast it is coming and how dramatically it is going to change society. In 2016, it is estimated that worldwide automobile accidents claimed the lives of more than 1.1 million people, while more than 31 million people were injured. Once this technology is commonplace and driverless cars are ubiquitous, those numbers will shrink to a tiny fraction of what they are today. The social impact will be even greater, to an extent that is very hard to fully imagine right now. Driverless cars will make car-sharing so much easier and more efficient that we could make do with 80% fewer cars. That would translate into less environmental pollution by decreased fuel consumption, less traffic congestion, fewer hours wasted on the roads and less need for car parks. Roads could be laid out very differently, making traffic more efficient and safer for passengers and pedestrians. Modern technology excels in saving us precious time and making our daily lives easier. The next technological innovation will also make our roads much safer.

Diet Food goes back to basics By Thomasina Miers The past few years has been all about fad diets, cutting out food groups, and buying expensive ingredients to chase superfoods and super health. None of this is realistic. And after a year in which our foundations have been rocked, I feel that dieting adds an unhealthy uncertainty to our lives that we really don’t need. Food should not be about denial, guilt or killing ourselves. It is about nurturing, comfort and spending time with people who are important to us. It is about comradeship and community and breaking down barriers. We need that more than ever. Next year will be about simplifying and going back to basics in the kitchen. The healthiest way to eat is to go as close to the source as possible. Lots of vegetables, which are cheap; lots of grains and beans. Meat only occasionally, and when it has been well looked after. My point isn’t that we spend hours or a fortune in the kitchen, just that we adopt an old-fashioned approach where we avoid processed food. I have three children and zero spare time, but we eat well. Dinner is often just kale sauteed in garlic and olive oil on toast with a fried egg on top. I think we’ll see this in restaurants, too. When was the last time you heard anyone raving about a 20-course tasting menu? It feels as though that is from the last decade. Now it’s all short menus and home cooking and milk from cows who might actually have eaten some grass in their lives. There is a comfort in that, and I think it plays into deeper insecurities many of us are experiencing.

Astronomy The Cassini misson’s grand finale from Saturn By Jim Al-Khalili When it comes to physics and astronomy, there have been a number of important stories in recent years that captured the public’s imagination. Look no further than the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider in 2012 or the first detection of gravitational waves in 2016: ripples in the fabric of space itself due to the collision of two black holes more than a billion light years away. Cool stuff. And who knows what might be just around the corner? While I cannot predict what discoveries will be made in 2017, I can say with some confidence that there is one science story guaranteed to make waves around the world. Of all the planets in the solar system, Saturn, with its beautiful rings, is without doubt the most enigmatic and mysterious, and in recent years we’ve had the privilege of being able to study it up close and personal thanks to the pictures beamed back to us by the Cassini spacecraft. The Cassini mission to the giant planet has provided us with jaw-droppingly stunning colour images of Saturn’s surface, its rings and its many moons. And we’ve also made some astonishing discoveries. For example, it has revealed jets of water vapour and organic material shooting out of the south pole of Enceladus, creating tremendous excitement that this tiny moon might even be able to support microbial life beneath its icy surface. But rest assured, the best is yet to come. In 2017, Cassini will come to the end of its mission, 20 years after it was launched in 1997. Nasa is calling this the Grand Finale, and it’s going to be pretty spectacular … In tighter and tighter orbits, over several weeks, the spacecraft is going to squeeze inside the innermost ring, skimming the surface of the planet ever more closely before finally disappearing beneath the clouds and plummeting to its death. For the Nasa scientists, it is going to be a huge challenge to collect as much data as possible during those final days, and there is no guarantee that Cassini’s instruments will work in the increasingly hostile conditions. They are hoping it will continue to beam back what it sees for as long as it can before being ultimately crushed by the incredible density and pressure within the gas giant. Cue tingles down spines, lumps in throats and tears in eyes all round. Jim Al-Khalili is a broadcaster and a professor of physics and public engagement in science at the University of Surrey. Environment A solution for overfishing By Sir James Dyson 2017 promises to be an exciting year for SafetyNet, a fishing net with a series of escape rings that help prevent young and endangered fish being caught. The invention, which is engineered by Dan Watson, won the James Dyson award in 2012 because it helps to address the very real problem of overfishing. SafetyNet exploits the escape behaviour of fish. Small and medium-sized fish swim upwards when stressed, whereas larger fish tend to swim downwards. SafetyNet has illuminated escape rings on its top side, which act like an emergency exit sign for the smaller fish. Water flowing through the wide-open meshes guides them to freedom, while the larger ones are retained in the net. Since winning the award, SafetyNet has been getting ever closer to making a global impact. Trials show that the number of undesired fish caught is reduced by more than half when SafetyNet is used. With trials set to continue around the world in 2017, I hope that the next round of testing will continue to build awareness of the terrible problem of overfishing. In 2017, SafetyNet technology will also go on sale to fishermen for the first time, with the first batches available in the middle of the year. But Watson also has his sights set on influencing the wider industry for the better. He will give a presentation on the topic of overfishing to the directorate-general for maritime affairs and fisheries in Brussels, to attract the attention of industry regulators and potentially shape future legislation. Nearly half of fish caught are thrown back into the sea because they are not suitable to be sold, and many don’t survive. If a significant number of young fish are being killed unnecessarily, this has an impact on the overall fish population. The best inventions use engineering and technology to solve existing problems and make the world a better place. SafetyNet shows how young graduates such as Watson can tackle global issues, all too often ignored by established industries, in new and inventive ways.

Neuroscience Neural networks and their effect on Alzheimer’s disease By Prof May-Britt Moser In this post-fact era, I believe that scientists’ engagement with society will be more important than ever before. We need to do our part in building public trust in science, by ensuring that our papers and talks are as solid and true to data as possible, but also by making sure the knowledge we produce is made accessible for people. I am excited about the novel results from our lab that we will share with the world in 2017. In our everyday lives, we rely on our ability to navigate and remember. Inside the brain, these cognitive functions have a physiological correlate as specific patterns of activity among nerve cells. Networks of communicating nerve cells form activity maps that each give rise to a specific function. In 2017, we will share new insights into the emergence and maturation of the cells and neural networks that give rise to higher cognitive functions like self-location and memory. These cells are also ground zero, and the very first to be affected by neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s. Knowing about how these cells develop into functional networks, giving rise to cognition and behavior, may help us understand what goes wrong when memory and navigation breaks down in people who are diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.

The arts The documenta exhibition revives the notion of utopia for a dystopian world By Stefan Kalmár In 1955, art professor and curator Arnold Bode founded the documenta art exhibition in the West German city of Kassel, once considered by Hitler for the German capital. Documenta was originally initiated to introduce, or rather reintroduce, art formerly branded by the Nazis as degenerate to the postwar German public. This exhibition has, over the past 61 years, become the Olympus of all exhibitions. It is not a biennial; it is a vision, a proposition and a utopia in a hopelessly dystopian world. Adam Szymczyk, the curator of documenta 14, which runs from 10 April to 17 September 2017, decided to stage, for the first time in the exhibition’s history, one half in another European city: Athens. By doing so, he has mapped the field that best describes the dialectical tension in modern democracy today. On one side is Kassel’s documenta: a post-fascist vehicle that believed in the transformative power of contemporary art. On the other side is Athens, the birthplace of democracy, which in recent years has become synonymous with the friction between democracy, national sovereignty and late capitalism. In my lifetime, I have not experienced a more complex and greater existential crisis than today – but a complex time can only be responded to in equally complex propositions. Documenta is a vehicle that affords the complex engagement with art and culture as what it is: a manifestation that responds to the sociopolitical conditions of our time. It is this that makes documenta, and particularly this documenta, so important, as it attempts to mediate between western democracy and capitalism in a state of crisis.

Architecture Centuries-old ideas show us how to define public space By Amanda Levete There has never been a more important time to find ways of bringing people together. We need public spaces in our cities and our buildings to unite people, spaces where everyone has the chance to gather and to celebrate what we have in common. I’m hopeful that 2017 will see the flickering resurgence of outdoor civic spaces blossom into something more profound and lasting. As citizens, we have perhaps been taking them for granted, but now we are actively recognising the roles played by these vital parts of the urban fabric, and demanding that our cities and institutions protect and expand them. In 2017 and beyond, we will be seeing cultural projects as urban projects – ones that engage with cities and their unrestrained, slightly messy, vibrancy. I’d like to think that MAAT, a new museum we designed in Lisbon, where the roof is a new place for people to appropriate as they like, is just one example of many more to come. It is used by lingering couples enjoying the sunset over the Tagus, by kids who just want to run up and down the steps, and by runners, cyclists and skateboarders. There is something visceral about physical interaction that people are coming to value even more with the rise of the digital. There will be a return to looking at Italian urban planning, such as the Nolli map of Rome that allowed us to see the open public spaces connecting a city, or the Piazza del Popolo of Todi, the city’s spiritual, civic and cultural heart, where everyone contributes to the sense of community and has done so for generations. Of course, these are centuries-old ideas and, in 2017, I hope there will be an increased humility in the architectural community in acknowledging our inspirations and inheritances as well as a renewal of that post-war idealism when architects thought architecture could help make a better society. Sometimes, looking back can be a more radical move than the advent of virtual or augmented reality – but it is an approach that architects and cities will increasingly pursue.

Space The Starshot project and solar sail technology By Maggie Aderin-Pocock I’ve been celebrating 50 years of Star Trek this year. I used to watch it as a child and thought, “Oh yes, this is for me.” I wanted warp drive, I wanted to travel to other planets and star systems. But as I grew older, I realised that our technology is so far from making interstellar travel possible – until now. Last April, the Starshot project was announced. It will use very high-powered lasers to accelerate solar sails on tiny spacecraft, sending them at a fifth of the speed of light to Alpha Centauri, our closest star system, in just 20 years. After the announcement, we discovered Proxima Centauri b, an Earth-like exoplanet orbiting Proxima Centauri itself. So it gets even more exciting. It pushes the technology we have at the moment to the limit, but the huge challenges are not insurmountable. I think we can do this, and work starts in 2017. We have a chance to take a closer look at an exoplanet, and perhaps even to find signs of life. Solar sail technology will also allow us to study our solar system in far greater time. We sent the New Horizons probe to Pluto and it took almost 10 years. With solar sails, we could zip across the solar system in a matter of weeks and see what’s out there. As a child, I thought all this was possible, and when I started studying it, I reined in my expectations. But this year, for the first time, I’m letting the dream continue. It is incredibly challenging, but when we look at what we’re achieving in miniaturisation and technology, I believe that in the next 15 to 20 years, we might have our first interstellar probe setting off for that 20-year journey to another star system. That puts it within my lifetime. Maggie Aderin-Pocock is a space scientist and honorary research associate at the UCL department of physics and astronomy. Developmental biology A leap forward in embryo technology By Dr Jim Smith Science sometimes appears to advance in great leaps, but each of those leaps is usually based on years of painstaking and often unheralded work – work based on nothing more than curiosity about how the world works. My area of research is developmental biology: the question of how the fertilised egg becomes an adult organism with all the right cell types in the right place. Of course, it had occurred to me that developmental biology research might one day have practical benefits, but this was not why I did it – I did it because the problem is so intriguing. But, as is often the case, this sort of “discovery” science is yielding extraordinary benefits. For example, the ability of developmental biologists to culture, manipulate and fertilise embryos in a petri dish, then to transfer the embryos to a mother, led to “test-tube babies”. And this year, thanks to pioneering work by Doug Turnbull, it has inspired the decision to allow doctors to apply for a licence to create “three-person babies”, thereby providing, for the first time, hope to mothers carrying mitochondrial disease. Now we know so much about what happens during normal embryonic development, we are in the extraordinary position of being able to recapitulate it and even to reverse it. Doug Melton has shown how stem cells from patients with type 1 diabetes can be turned into pancreatic beta-cells; many researchers are making “organoids”, three-dimensional stem cell cultures that will allow the design of personal treatment regimes and generate new cells for gene editing and transplantation. Equally exciting is the recent discovery by Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, inspired by his work on newt limb regeneration, that it may even be possible to reverse ageing. As we understand more about development, now using techniques from chemistry, mathematics, engineering and physics, we can expect even more remarkable discoveries and treatments. This year, Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz managed to increase by 50% the length of time we can keep human embryos alive in a dish – I can’t wait to see what we’ll learn about ourselves.

Sadness, yes. Shame, maybe. Or anger that in rich, so-called “modern” Britain, such a thing needs to exist. But when I spoke to Jane – a volunteer at a central London food bank – in December, it felt like a bit of hope peering out amid the dark. Things weren’t easy for Jane. Made redundant a year ago, she’d lost a job in journalism that she loved and was struggling to find paid work. But like many of the people I met last year – from Claire, a mum of three funding food parcels for families at her children’s school, to Louise, an ex-teacher running a clothes bank out of a local church – Jane was giving up her time to help strangers who are struggling. Look hard enough and that sort of solidarity is all around us. Take food banks. Many of Jane’s fellow volunteers had previously used the service themselves and wanted to give something back. Each week, a Citizens Advice volunteer comes in to help those needing a food parcel get back on their feet: filling in benefit forms or checking eviction notices. A few days after the Guardian published the article about her, Jane emailed me, overwhelmed: they’d received donations of almost £6,000. These are in many ways grim times, where the most basic dignities – regular meals or a secure home for your kids – are too often out of reach. And with each government cut and wage squeeze over recent years has come a gnawing fear that as a society – divided, scared, selfish – we’re turning in on ourselves. Or worse, against each other. Right now, I think it’s easy to feel that anyone suffering is essentially out on their own. But time and time again, I’m struck by how ordinary people choose to come together – and the incredible good that it does. I’ve seen grassroots campaigns across the UK such as Sisters Uncut fight for long-term funding for domestic violence survivors. And Disabled People Against Cuts – a group that started as just a handful of disabled people – persuading the United Nations to investigate the government’s disability cuts. I’m in awe of community groups rallying with their time and donations, from TheBusShelterMK in Milton Keynes trying to raise £30,000 to convert a double decker into a shelter for homeless people, to the Biscuit Fund – anonymous “gifters” who scan benefit forums to find families who need help – giving more than £50,000 for anything from freezers to food hampers. I am inspired by the trade unions starting the year defending decent pay, job security, and workers’ rights post-Brexit. Or the pro bono lawyers overturning social care cuts and the law students winning disabled people’s “fit for work” appeals. No one should have to fight as hard to survive as so many in this country currently do. But I find hope in seeing that any struggle gets easier when we stand beside each other. Let’s take on 2017 together.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/02/poverty-uk-rays-light-food-banks-hope-people','Poverty in the UK is a grim, growing reality.

But how about the state the rest of the world is is in? You could consider putting something good into a community. Emma Jacobs: working on a kibbutz in the Israeli desert For my generation, rising global temperatures are the norm and a clear threat to our future. It doesn’t help that the US now has a president-elect who claims that climate change is a “Chinese hoax”. So it is important that we explore alternative, sustainable ways to live. That’s why I’m spending my gap year learning how to farm in the desert and recycle poo. Yeah, I know, gap yahs have been roundly mocked as the cliched preserve of those privileged youths who just want to “discover themselves”. But studies have shown they can be good for personal development and teach skills that are beneficial at university and beyond. So, along with 12 other teenagers, I’m spending a month on Kibbutz Lotan in the middle of the desert in southern Israel. We are a living social experiment: a self-sustaining, ecological “village” . My home is a dome made of mud, clay, straw and a waterproofing layer of turpentine and recycled cooking oil, which I share with three others. It’s a modern hut with a fan, plugs and even air-con. The village has compost toilets, solar showers, a sustainable kitchen with biogas and a bike-cum-washing machine that provides a work-out. It’s a massive change from the lives that most of us lead back in London. We’ve replaced Starbucks and shellac nails with shovels; it’s taken some time to get over the culture shock. Our days start with an 8 am wake-up: horribly early for me, but late for the real kibbutz workers who rise as early as 1 am to milk the cows. We start the chores before breakfast: cleaning the kitchen, loos and showers, and “feeding” the biogas with yesterday’s food scraps. After breakfast in the communal dining hall, we have permaculture and ecology lessons about the ethics of genetically modified crops, maintaining compost heaps, caring for the animals and keeping morale up throughout the long, hot days. We shovel goat and cow manure and build mud walls for the kibbutz kindergarten. Working with animal dung is weirdly liberating for us townies. “Being on kibbutz has made us feel less materialistic,” says participant Max Klass. He’s never worked with animals before but says getting up close to the cows and goats is bringing out his “rough and ready side”. A simpler, more sustainable, ecologically ethical lifestyle is an achievable feat if you start on a small scale, adds participant Dan Apter. “People don’t know that shovelling shit is such fun.” I’ve found there’s more to the kibbutz experience than just an ecological education. We’re learning to live a truly communal life. It can be tough, but living in an “intentional community” feels like valuable training for university and a life of work. Yet even in this utopia, the books have to balance. Like many kibbutzim nowadays, this one has been privatised to ensure its economic survival. But it is still a place where members debate issues such as whether it’s ethical to maintain a refet (dairy), the extent of communal responsibility, and how to fairly distribute resources. This time next year, I’ll be at Leeds University. I may not need to pick dates, farm or manage a compost loo there, but I’ll take the broader lessons that I’m learning on the kibbutz with me. I know it will affect the decisions I make about all sorts of things, from which products to buy to how to use transport. And it’s given me all kinds of ideas for the future. Sam Hickford: volunteering in a Catholic refuge in London My new home is the Giuseppe Conlon House, a former Roman Catholic church in north London. It is a well-preserved Edwardian building with a crypt, a confessional and an austere church hall. Nowadays it is the host of an intentional community run by London Catholic Worker, and a house of hospitality for refugees. Practically speaking, this involves a handful of volunteers living shoulder-to-shoulder with 20 asylum seekers, who are treated as guests. They live here as they pursue their asylum claims, which can take a long time. The old confessional is now used to store donated tins and vegetables. The crypt, which I like to imagine once housed the bones of saints, now contains two rooms where people sleep. The church hall is a multi-purpose living space where everyone sits for candlelit suppers. I’m about a month into my gap year now, having committed to a minimum of three months here. Perhaps the difference between this and more typical volunteering schemes is the authentic sense of community. We do everything as a group, regularly gathering for morning and night prayer in the hall among the bin bags filled with donated Manchester United jerseys and Queens Park Rangers boxer shorts. Lots of organisations run projects like this: you can contact Diggers and Dreamers, Eurotopia or WWOOF if you’re interested. I live here for free: meals and lodging are provided as long as you pull your weight with the chores. I’m given weekly volunteering expenses of £30, which allow me to meet up with friends for the odd drink. You meet a few characters at a place like this: climate change activists, Passionist priests and Servite nuns frequently pop in to chat and sometimes stay for a night or two. This creates a warmth that contrasts with the anonymity of the affluent neighbourhood outside. Life in the community is unlike anything I’ve experienced before. There’s little privacy. My room contains a second bed that is usually occupied by another guest. The sheer number of people coming and going is difficult to adapt to. You’re confronted with your personal flaws when you’ve got company at all times – in my case, a tendency to be petty about minor things. Several times, I’ve needed to invent an excuse to go to a private place in some unused part of the house. One of these is the reading room, a cold, dank space which no one uses in the winter, where I freeze in solitude for a bit, just to get away from the commotion. But it does make every day exciting. Even at breakfast each morning, I’m bound to meet someone new. Many of my friends elsewhere – graduates who now work in London or other cities – say their busy lives don’t allow them time to stop and make friends, or get to know the area they live in. I feel lucky not to have these problems right now. I think my time here is preparing me for my studies at UCL next year. I am learning interpersonal skills, such as managing conflict and counselling, as well as solid practical skills: I cook for lots of people and I can deseed a donated pomegranate in no time. In many ways, the chaotic life here is like that of a student house – with just a few more rowdy housemates.

Anne Wafula Strike, 42, a British wheelchair racer who has no use of her legs, is a board member of UK Athletics, has an MBE for services to disability sport and serves as a patron of several charities supporting the rights of people with disabilities. The Kenyan-born athlete said she was left profoundly humiliated after being left to urinate on herself on a CrossCountry train, covering her face with her hoodie after the incident in case anyone recognised her. “I was completely robbed of my dignity by the train company,” she said. “I would like to ask the train company when will they give me my dignity back? As a disabled person I have worked so hard over the years to build up my confidence and self-belief. “Having access to a toilet, especially in a developed nation like the UK, is one of the most basic rights. I tried to conceal the smell of urine by spraying perfume over myself. When I finally got home after my nightmare journey, I scrubbed myself clean in the shower then flung myself on my bed and sobbed for hours.” She added: “After thinking about it for a while I decided to go public despite the personal humiliation of doing so in the hope that it will bring about change for other people with disabilities who want to contribute to society but are prevented from doing so. Too many people with disabilities suffer in silence when this kind of thing happens because they feel too embarrassed to talk about it. “The whole incident made me feel as if I can’t play an active role in society and should just hide behind closed doors. Being forced to sit in my own urine destroyed my self-esteem and my confidence. “People with disabilities don’t want perfection, we just want the basics and to have our independence. But lack of access and inclusive facilities make us feel as if we are an afterthought.” The incident happened when Wafula Strike was returning from a UK Athletics board meeting in Coventry on 8 December. She took a taxi from Coventry to Nuneaton station and from there boarded the 17.22pm CrossCountry train to Stansted airport, where she could catch a connecting train to her home town of Harlow. On the journey, which is usually scheduled to last two hours and 48 minutes, she needed to use the toilet but found that the accessible one was out of order. “If the able-bodied toilet had been closer I could have tried to crawl to it but it was too far away and my wheelchair could not fit in the aisles to get to it,” she said. A member of the train crew suggested she could get off the train when it stopped at a station, use the disabled toilet there and wait for the next train. This would have delayed her journey home but in the event there were no staff at the station to help her so she was unable to get off the train. She tweeted the train company’s customer service team to complain and in a series of exchanges Wafula Strike became increasingly distressed. Wafula Strike said she felt she had to speak out to expose some of the injustice faced by people living with disabilities. “I’ll probably be remembered as that woman who wet herself on the train. I could have kept quiet but I hope that by speaking out other wheelchair users who use public transport won’t be subjected to the same experience I had. “I may have an impairment but the barriers society puts in my path are the real handicap. The UK Athletics meeting I had just attended was so positive – all about success and medals and athletics superstars and then this happened. UK Athletics has always gone out of its way to ensure that the board meetings are held in accessible venues but other organisations need to do the same so people like me can play our part in society.” Sue Bott, deputy chief executive of Disability Rights UK, expressed concern about the incident. “The courts are starting to take cases like this very seriously,” she said. “Not only the lack of access but also the injury to feeling that occurs. If Anne decides to take legal action we would be right behind her. No one should have to go through an experience like that. Access and inclusion need to be taken seriously. These things should not just be tick box exercises.” A CrossCountry spokesman said: “We are extremely sorry for the circumstances of Mrs Strike’s recent journey with us, and our managing director has passed on our apologies to her along with an explanation of why it appears all our systems failed her on that day. We hope she will take up our offer and contact us in the new year so we can offer her a more pleasant experience of travelling with us.”','https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/02/paralympian-anne-wafula-strike-wet-herself-train-no-accessible-toilet','Paralympian forced to wet herself on train without accessible toilet',311,'society'),('science/sifting-the-evidence/2017/jan/02/ill-say-it-again-e-cigarettes-are-still-far-safer-than-smoking','January is a time for New Year’s resolutions and if you’re one of the world’s one billion smokers, your resolution may be to stop smoking. For some people, this year’s quit attempt might involve an electronic cigarette, and a recent study in England, published in the BMJ, suggested that these devices helped at least 18,000 smokers to stop in 2015 who would not otherwise have done so. That’s very good news, but will there be as many quit attempts in 2017 as there have been in the past with e-cigarettes? I’m not so sure. Since I last wrote about e-cigarettes in this column one year ago, headlines about the dangers of these devices have continued to appear and show no sign of abating. The result is clear. More people believe today, compared with a year ago, that e-cigarettes are as harmful as smoking. In fact these incorrect perceptions have risen year on year, from fewer than one in ten adults in Great Britain in 2013 to one in four this past summer. Surveys of smokers show similar patterns, with an increasing proportion believing that e-cigarettes are more or equally harmful than tobacco. Yet we know that these harm perceptions are wrong. There is now very strong evidence, from a range of studies, that vaping - inhaling nicotine without the combustion involved in smoking - is far less risky than smoking cigarettes. Just a few months ago this body of evidence was brought together by the Royal College of Physicians who published an authoritative report analysing dozens of studies and concluded that the hazard to health arising from long term vapour inhalation from e-cigarettes is unlikely to exceed 5% of the harm from smoking tobacco. The RCP, and since then other UK doctor’s organisations such as the Royal College of General Practitioners, have made clear that it is important to promote the use of e-cigarettes, along with other non-tobacco nicotine products (like Nicotine Replacement Therapy such as gum or inhalators) to smokers who are trying to quit. The work of these organisations is underpinned by a consensus statement endorsed by many of the main health charities and public health bodies in the UK. They agree that vaping is safer than smoking, and while these products are not risk free and should not be promoted to children or never smokers, they have a legitimate and positive role to play in tobacco control. But this consensus is not shared around the world. The regular stream of media scare stories driving harm perceptions often originates in other countries where there is no such view about relative risks. Some media headlines are driven by poor science but others originate from reports by credible organisations who focus on the absolute risk of any e-cigarette use without comparing it to smoking (which is uniquely deadly and kills one in two regular users). 2016 saw at least two major reports of this kind. In September the World Health Organisation published a report that set out a series of steps on e-cigarette regulation for countries signed up to the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, a global public health treaty. These options were primarily about banning or severely restricting the sale, distribution and marketing of e-cigarettes. The WHO report was comprehensively critiqued by the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies, but its findings mean that e-cigarettes will continue to be unavailable to millions of smokers in many countries who have banned these devices or are considering doing so. December 2016 saw the publication of a review authored by the US Surgeon General, which focused on e-cigarette use in young people. This described e-cigarette use as a public health concern, arguing that e-cigarettes are now the most commonly used tobacco product amongst US youth and that nicotine use in any form is unsafe for young people and also pregnant women. While some of the science in the report is accurate, the conclusions endorsing heavy regulation of e-cigarettes were not. The report did not compare the risks of smoking and vaping, failed to make clear that e-cigarettes are not tobacco products, and drew conclusions about nicotine that would also apply to Nicotine Replacement Therapy - which is safe and licensed for use in pregnancy and by young smokers. It also endorsed policies which could deter current smokers from switching to e-cigarettes. American scientists have critiqued data from the USA that provided the basis for the Surgeon General’s report, but it is likely that this publication will contribute to public perceptions that e-cigarettes are dangerous. These two reports largely ignore the fact that there are already measures in place in many countries (including all of the EU) to protect the public from any risks from e-cigarettes. These include policies like age of sale, limits on advertising and child- and tamper-proof packaging - all important to protect children while still allowing sales to adult smokers and ex-smokers. Concerns about exploding batteries and nicotine poisoning can also be dealt with by following simple safety rules, such as those set out by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. I believe that e-cigarettes have huge potential to save lives by providing an alternative to smoking. Yet this can only be realised if we address negative harm perceptions and communicate honestly with the public. Ongoing research can help with this, and 2016 has seen the start of important studies, many commissioned by Cancer Research UK, which will tell us more in the future. We also need to keep our eye on new technology, such as heat not burn tobacco products, which are emerging and about which we know little. Only time will tell whether the UK’s positive approach towards e-cigarettes strikes the right balance between risks and benefits. For now, however, we must do all we can to encourage smokers to try to stop at New Year or any other time. For those trying with e-cigarettes, this is a positive choice that should be supported.

According to a spokesman for Arron Banks, a leading donor of the movement to leave the EU, the studio is eager to adapt his memoir, The Bad Boys of Brexit. Speaking to the Telegraph, Banks’s spokesperson Andy Wigmore said: “We have had some very serious Hollywood people in touch with us who are going to buy the rights to the book. They want to buy the option on it.” Wigmore said Warner Bros representatives were keen to meet Banks and Nigel Farage when they are in the US later this month for the presidential inauguration of Donald Trump. The Bad Boys of Brexit tells of the car insurance salesman’s rise to prominence after deciding to donate £1m to the UK Independence Party in October 2014, followed by a further £5m to various anti-EU causes. The memoir’s official blurb reads: From a David Brent-style office on an industrial estate in the south-west, Banks masterminded an extraordinary social media campaign against the tyrannies of Brussels that became a mass movement for Brexit. He tore up the political rule book, sinking £8 million of his personal fortune into a madcap campaign targeting ordinary voters up and down the country. His anti-establishment crusade upset everyone from Victoria Beckham to Nasa and left MPs open-mouthed. When his rabble-rousing antics landed him in hot water, he simply redoubled his efforts to wind up the targets. Lurching from comedy to crisis (often several times a day), he found himself in the glare of the media spotlight, fending off daily bollockings from Nigel Farage and po-faced MPs. Wigmore reported that producers would not need to supplement their research much as “that book is like a screenplay, so half the work has been done for them”. He also declared that profits from the film would not directly wind up in either his or Farage’s pockets. “It is not like it is something we would personally benefit from.” Speaking on 1 January, Tim Farron, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, dismissed the concept. “Movie executives must be doing a pretty expensive wind up or have had far too much to drink at a Christmas party to think it was a good idea,” he said. “It promises to be a horror flick found in the bargain bins.” A spokesperson for Warner Bros said the studio had no comment.','https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/02/brexit-the-movie-warner-bros-set-to-option-ukip-donors-memoirs-aaron-banks','Brexit: the movie seems imminent as Warner Bros set to option Ukip donor\'s memoirs',313,'film'),('tv-and-radio/2017/jan/02/sherlock-recap-series-four-episode-one-the-six-thatchers','Spoiler alert: this recap contains spoilers to the Sherlock episode The Six Thatchers, which aired on 1 January 2017. Steven Moffatt and Mark Gattis have never shied from fiddling with the format of Sherlock. For each “normal” episode – clever deductions, crime solving, battling Moriarty in a war of wits – we get a “weird” one: a big set-piece wedding, conflicting explanations for Sherlock’s resurrection, a drug-induced fever dream set in Victorian London. Occasionally these odder episodes stray too far from the formula, trying too hard to impress the obsessives, while giving too little to the casual viewer. This time around, they got it spot on, combining rewarding scenes of Sherlock’s smart-aleck detective work with grand series arcs, empathetic character evolution and a shocking and series-altering death. And for the first time, we see Sherlock’s arrogance, his need to be smarter than everyone else, proving to be his downfall rather than his saviour. Throughout the episode we hear repeated versions of the same story: Appointment in Samarra, an old fable about being unable to escape an appointment with death. The story, first read in its entirety by Sherlock, is based on an ancient Mesopotamian fable that appears in the Babylonian Talmud. A 1934 American novel, about the eventual suicide of the fictional character Julian English, was also inspired by the tale and borrowed its title. Here too, it is used as a forebringer of elective self-destruction, with Mary, after spending much of the episode on the run, facing up to the inevitability of her death. Before we get into all that, a quick catch-up for anyone who has forgotten a few of the finer details in the three-year gap between series. In the final episode of the third series (His Last Vow), Sherlock shot media mogul Magnussen, in order to prevent him from revealing Mary’s true identity and blackmailing John. That forced Mycroft to banish Sherlock from the UK, sending him on a mission in eastern Europe that would likely result in his death. Sherlock is recalled four minutes later as Moriarty, thought to be dead, appeared on every screen in the country with his chilling new catchphrase, “Did you miss me?”. Then in 2016’s one-off special (The Abominable Bride), Sherlock entered a drug-induced stupor which returned him to Victorian London, all to reach the not-that-startling conclusion that Moriarty is probably really dead, but getting other people to do his posthumous bidding. “Are those ginger nuts? I love ginger nuts.” We pick up with Sherlock and Mycroft in the Cabinet Office. Sherlock is like an excitable child, grabbing fistfuls of biscuits and tweeting, with a Trumpesque brashness, about his return to Britain. Mycroft and senior figures in the government, including Elizabeth Smallwood, explain how they’ve covered up his assassination of Magnussen by doctoring the footage to make it look like someone else did it. But Sherlock shows little gratitude, instead opting to engage the secretary, Mrs Norbury, in a brief riff on Mivvis, the discontinued ice lolly. Norbury is also told not to take any minutes because this operation is so top secret it must never be spoken about. “A jellyfish? You can’t arrest a jelly fish!” There’s a lovely sequence that follows where Sherlock, thrilled to be back on the job, solves scores of seemingly impossible cases mostly without ever standing up. It’s a humorous nod to what this show has chosen not to be: a conventional detective drama where a few sneaky clues give away the killer. The BBC also brought back its other noticing-things detective this week, Jonathan Creek. In the first Creek episode, a mother and her children mysteriously dying was lazily put-to-bed with a last-minute mention of a rare blood disease. This section feels like it is mocking the slapdash answer of shows like Creek, when Sherlock apparently solves eight murders in under a minute with throwaway lines like “Odd socks? Arrest the brother-in-law” and “If the dog can’t swim the neighbour did it.” Sherlock’s still solving mysteries via text when Mary goes into labour, and refuses to put his phone down when John asks him to be godfather to their newborn daughter, or even during the christening. “Mary? This is about Mary” So to the meat of the episode: after Sherlock resolves a case about a dead boy mysteriously appearing in his own car (he was wearing a vinyl car seat for a birthday prank, of course) he becomes obsessed over a smashed bust of Margaret Thatcher. Soon more smashed Thatchers start appearing all over England. A handy hacker reveals that all the statues were made in Tbilisi, a run of six. Sherlock hunts down the final statue in Reading, where he catches its robber red-handed, engaging in some wild hand-to-hand combat, and a violent scene where they try to drown each other in a swimming pool. Sherlock assumes it’s Moriarty behind all this, somehow sending underlings to search for the valuable Borgia pearl hidden inside one of the statues. But when he smashes the final statue open he finds a USB stick, seemingly the same USB stick Mary gave John in His Last Vow, with all the information about her former life as a freelance assassin. The bust thief, Ajay, says he used to work with Mary before she betrayed him, and that he is intent on killing her. Sherlock promises to protect Mary, referring to the vow he made at the christening (turns out he was listening after all), but she doesn’t think he can … so she drugs him and does a runner. Throughout the episode Sherlock talks earnestly about the vows he’s made to Mary and John, promising to be a protector for the family. This, coupled with the flashy combat scenes, seems to add up to Sherlock taking the role of a more traditional action hero, something alluded to by the creators who said previously that they wanted to make Sherlock more of a goodie and, in the words of Cumberbatch, “less of a dick”. Anyway, Mary goes on the run, rolling dice to decide which country she should go to next. One thing she didn’t count on is that Sherlock stuck a tracking device in her USB stick. After endless travels and assumed identities, she doesn’t seem that pissed off when Sherlock and John show up in Egypt having tracked her down without any fuss. Indeed Mary and Sherlock are getting on famously, making jokes at John’s expense and forming the main double act of the episode. It’s all japes and laughs between the two of them, despite the fact that he’s completely ruined her cover and Ajay appears moments later, armed and ready to kill her. He tells Mary she betrayed him during a mission in Tbilisi, and blames her for his six years of torture by his captors. He says the Georgian terrorists had been tipped off about the mission by someone with the codename Ammo – a British woman. Mary tries to explain that this wasn’t her, but Ajay is killed before she has the chance. “So many lies, I don’t just mean you…” In a slightly unsatisfying subplot, John meets a mystery women on the bus who gives him her number. We learn later that he followed up on the encounter, having some very weak flirty banter – “Night Owl?” “Vampire” – and potentially meeting up too. It seems unlikely the perfect John Watson would have had an affair with a stranger, cheating on the mother of his child, so there’s likely more to this story than first appears. John eventually breaks things off by telling her “I’m not free” rather than “I’m not single”, so perhaps it was Sherlock she was asking him to betray, not Mary. “A nice location for the final act” After a quick bit of mindpalace deduction, Sherlock works out it was the secretary, Mrs Norbury, who actually betrayed Agra all those years ago, and they arrange to meet in the London Aquarium, both of them enjoying the drama of the location. Norbury admits she had been selling state secrets for cash, but was about to rumbled by the British ambassador in Georgia. Fortunately, the ambassador was taken hostage, but when Norbury found out Agra were going in to save them, she knew she’d be found out. So she tipped off the terrorists, ensuring everyone died and her secret would never be discovered. She told them the code name too, Ammo, or Amo, Latin for “Love”, which is also Elizabeth Smallwood’s codename. So if anyone did enquire, they might assume it was Smallwood who had given the order (as Sherlock did earlier on). At this point it could have all been over. Lestrade walks in with the police, Norbury is arrested, everyone goes back to Baker Street for a nice cup of tea. But Sherlock has to push things further, analysing Norbury, accusing her of acting out of jealousy towards her powerful colleagues, and goading her about her loneliness, alcoholism and predictability. Mrs Norbury is successfully provoked, and in a last-ditch attempt to prove her spontaneity, fires a gun in the direction of Sherlock, but Mary jumps to take the bullet. A minute later, she’s dead. In her final moments she tells Sherlock they are now equal (after the time she shot him) and describes her love for John, who groans in uncontrollable agony, only breaking to tell Sherlock he betrayed his vow. It’s a brutal scene, and one that leaves John a widow, just like in the Conan Doyle stories. Having said that, I take slight issue with the manner of Mary’s death. Certainly Sherlock avoids the boring cliche of other TV shows where guns are waved around as a threat but never actually fired. But it does seem like characters are shot in the chest quite a lot in this series. After a while, you do hope for something a little more dramatic – particularly when the assembled parties are gathered next to a shark tank. In the run-up to this episode, there was concern from some that Moffat and Gattis’s decision to amend Conan Doyle’s The Six Napoleons to The Six Thatchers was going to cause controversy, with the writers having to defend themselves against accusations that the luvvie-lefty BBC was indulging them in their desire to show Thatcher’s head being repeatedly smashed to rubble. But in the end, there was nothing political about the episode. In fact it was the Iron Sherlock that was not for turning, his lack of compromise and cruel characterisations leading to the death of Sherlock’s new best pal. In the final scene back at Baker Street, he tells Mrs Hudson that any time he is getting too cocky, she should say the word “Norbury” to him – a reminder that his ego can cause misery as well as brilliance. Mysteries unsolved Redbeard, Sherlock’s childhood dog, and the one word Sherlock wrote in his notebook at the end of the 2016 episode, makes another appearance – this time in a dream when Sherlock is briefly drugged by Mary. At the end of the episode Sherlock tells a psychiatrist that he keeps having the same dream. Could this be about Redbeard too? In one of the final scenes, Mycroft removes a takeaway menu from his fridge (weird that Mycroft has a fridge? Or would consider ordering takeaway?) to reveal a Post-it note reading “13th”. He sighs, then makes a call – “put me through to Sherrinford please”. Sherrinford was the name Conan Doyle originally intended to use for Sherlock, but has since been taken by other writers as Sherlock and Mycroft’s older brother. Could we be about to meet a third Holmes? Notes and observations John jokingly asks if it’s “too early for a divorce?” when he’s left on childcare duties. It’s one of a couple of lines that seems poignant-in-retrospect, as we’ve since learnt that Martin Freeman and Amanda Abbington had separated shortly before filming this episode. John Watson is an army man, a man who respects authority and observes the conventions of polite society. Why on Earth, may I ask, did he leave a London bus through the front door? That’s it – see you back here next week for the introduction of Toby Jones as Culverton Smith.','https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/02/sherlock-recap-series-four-episode-one-the-six-thatchers','Sherlock recap: series four, episode one – The Six Thatchers',314,'tv-and-radio'),('sport/blog/2017/jan/02/talking-horses-best-racing-bets-for-sussex-national-day-at-plumpton','Today’s best bets, by Chris Cook These days, the name ‘Tizzard’ is the first one to grab your attention, if you happen to be perusing the list of trainers involved in a staying chase. So it is with today’s Sussex National at Plumpton, for which Colin T’s Sartorial Elegance was predicted as favourite in the morning papers. Evidently, the betting market is not entirely convinced, however, as it has allowed this six-year-old to drift out to 8-1. I share those reservations, since this six-year-old has been raised more than a stone in the weights for hammering a handful of rivals at this track last month. Of course, he’ll be interesting again if those odds get any bigger. But it’s interesting to note that Tizzard is not quite so in-form as one might assume. Since his spectacular November, he’s been rubbing along at a strike-rate of 12%, though the successes have certainly been high-profile and he’s punching miles above his weight in prize money terms. If today is not his day, then perhaps it might be a day for Emma Lavelle, maintaining a fine strike-rate of 21% through her first season in a new stable. She fields Onderun (2.50), a former pointer who finally came good at Lingfield last month, taking over at halfway and winning by eight lengths. That first success was also his first run for 11 months and the trainer reported the eight-year-old had been “all wrong” the previous winter. An 8lb rise does not look at all excessive and he is at the right end of the weights for this big-field slog. He’s 11-2 and proving popular. There’s 7-1 about Dormouse (3.50) in the closer, which is fair. This 12-year-old was predictably left behind on a sound surface at Leicester in November but will be more suited by the ground he gets here and has fallen to a fair weight, a few pounds below the mark from which he won twice at Lingfield in December 2015. Tom Scudamore, who was aboard for both of those, returns to the saddle. The card at Ayr goes ahead, a planned inspection having been cancelled. I like the 7-2 about Lochnell (1.00), whose three wins have all been at this track, including over course and distance in November. She was a fair second at Doncaster last time when the going lacked the necessary juice for her. On Southwell’s Fibresand, Englishwoman (1.40) tempts at 12-1, returning to this track for the first time since scoring twice here in February. A series of summer defeats on grass have taken her back down to a beatable mark and there was renewed promise in her Kempton effort last month.','https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/jan/02/talking-horses-best-racing-bets-for-sussex-national-day-at-plumpton','Talking Horses: Best racing bets for Sussex National day at Plumpton',315,'sport'),('global-development/2017/jan/02/brazils-men-helped-to-become-better-fathers-to-reduce-gender-violence','Getting men to be active fathers may not seem the most obvious way to tackle gender-based violence. But, according to Gary Barker, CEO and founder of Promundo, which engages men and boys in ending violence against women and girls, policies that encourage men to do more unpaid care work are a vital part of achieving gender equality. “To us, it seemed obvious that we needed to figure out more constructive ways to engage men on this topic,” he says. In fact, there can be consequences when men aren’t brought into initiatives to empower women. According to Barker, while in the long-term, women who are better off financially are less likely to be involved in a violent relationship and more likely to leave a violent partner, in the short-term, the opposite can be true. Micro-credit programmes that target women, for example, can initially lead to an increase in violence. “[Her partner] may be feeling economically disempowered, the power dynamic feels like it’s shifting … and in some settings and some relationships, men might not be ready for that,” Barker explains. To tackle this in Brazil, Promundo runs a companion project to the government’s bolsa familia cash transfer programme, which for more than a decade has given cash to families living in poverty in return for enrolling their children in school and attending regular health checks. Bolsa familia reaches nearly a quarter of the country’s population, and 93% of its beneficiaries are women. Promundo’s companion project trained public sector staff to discuss gender equality and the importance of sharing care work when administering bolsa familia grants. “We worked with staff who implement that programme to say, let’s encourage him to be part of helping the child with homework, let’s encourage him to go to the meetings with teachers,” says Barker. The project seems to be working. At the start, 75% of male participants said men’s responsibilities included childcare, by the end, 100% agreed. Promundo, which works in more than 20 countries and receives funding from foundations and government sources, including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Bank, also recently successfully campaigned for Brazil to increase entitlement to paternity leave – one of few policy examples promoting men’s involvement in care work. Men are now able to take 20 days of paid parental leave, as opposed to the previous five. Barker had campaigned for more paternity leave in Brazil in 2007, but failed because too many employers did not want to provide this extra benefit to staff. He was also told by women’s rights organisations that mothers did not believe their partners were ready to care for their children. Barker hopes the country becoming one of only a handful in the global south to offer paid leave for fathers will begin closing the huge gap between men and women in time spent on caregiving. Combined with better policies around education and psychosocial support, he hopes it will also reduce levels of gender-based violence. According to the annual Map of Violence, in 2015 a woman was killed every two hours in Brazil. Whereas Brazilian women spend 22 hours a week, on average, on care and domestic work, men only spend 10 hours and eight minutes, according to Promundo’s 2015 State of the World’s Fathers report. The key, Barker says, will be scaling up work to engage men from small-scale projects at community level to become a more mainstream part of government policy and development programmes. “There’s a growing amount of evidence that if we can do this long enough and deep enough, and with enough key actors, we can see change. But they’ve been in limited areas – five schools, four provinces in a country,” he says. His views are shared by a number of women’s and girls’ rights organisations. According to Kerry Smith, head of girls’ rights and youth at Plan International UK, which works with men and boys to prevent female genital mutilation and child marriage: “If you want to address stereotypes of what women and girls are, you absolutely need to address stereotypes that men have to operate under as well. “In our minds, it isn’t the most important element, it isn’t the only element, but it is an essential ingredient of tackling and ending violence against women and girls. You need to look at it in a public health way. You need to treat and respond to the actual violence and you also need to take preventative measures, both of which need funding.” Toral Pattni, Care International’s senior humanitarian adviser for gender, acknowledges that in the context of limited funds, the balance between work with men and boys and protecting women who have experienced violence is “something many organisations struggle with. But if we are simply responding to the need but not tackling, not preventing it, then we are only ever going to be responding to the need.” Barker believes it’s time to assess how much it would cost to engage more men. “It’s a really key moment to now say how much would it cost to scale this up ... and to build it in to other streams of funding. To say, what does it cost to [engage men] in what you’re already doing?”','https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jan/02/brazils-men-helped-to-become-better-fathers-to-reduce-gender-violence','Brazil\'s men helped to become better fathers to reduce gender violence',316,'global-development'),('environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/jan/02/climate-change-in-2016-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly','This past year had so many stories involving human-caused climate change – it will be forever in our memories. Here is a summary of some of the high points, from my perspective. When I say “high points” I don’t necessarily mean good. Some of these high points are bad and some are downright ugly. Let’s do the good first. The Good The best news of all, in my opinion, is the continued cost reductions and huge installations of clean energy both in the US and around the word. Wind, solar, and other renewables have been on an incredible run of decreasing costs and creative financing, which has made them economically competitive with dirty fossil fuels. Improvements and expansion of grid-based power storage has also advanced. These storage abilities are needed to allow intermittent power sources (like wind and solar) to play an even larger role in delivering power to the grid. In the end, clean power will win out based on simple dollars and cents – regardless of the fact they will also help save the world. On an international scale, the US, China, and other countries ratified the Paris climate agreement, which gives us a reasonable chance at avoiding the worst effects of climate change. In the lead up to that ratification, the US took major actions domestically to reduce its own emissions through steps like the Clean Power Plan. Emissions have been reduced in some countries like the US for a variety of reasons. First, very cheap natural gas is displacing dirtier coal-based power. Secondly, renewable energy sources like wind and solar are expanding, and people are using energy more wisely. All of this happened with a major reduction in energy costs in the US. This shows you can have clean energy that is also cheap. In court, it was a good year. A rag-tag group of pro-bono climate scientists beat a bunch of high-paid contrarians in court. We showed that their science was nonsense and the smart judge gave a very harsh judgement to the funded deniers. And last in this part of the list, I think this is the year we can say the climate deniers and the contrarians who downplay global warming threats finally lost the science war. In the past, there were a dwindling few scientists each year that attempted to find evidence that the world was not warming, or wasn’t warming much. Each year, the number of scientists in this group got smaller and smaller. This year, they were virtually nonexistent. The contrarians have almost given up looking for contrarian evidence – it just isn’t there. They have ceded the scientific field because their research was found to be wrong. Now, these contrarian scientists only appear in blogs, op-eds in newspapers, sometimes in pay-for-play journals – but rarely in competitively reviewed scientific venues. After being wrong for decades, they have seemingly just given up. The Bad Despite the progress above, global warming continued. In fact, 2016 marked the third year in a row that record global temperatures were set. We are well over halfway to the 2-degree mark that puts us into a real climate danger zone and we have not even come close to doubling CO2 yet (although we will). The temperature levels reached this year don’t prove the world is warming; in fact, we never look at a single year as evidence. Rather, proof was found in the oceans. Several major studies were published this year that clearly show the world’s oceans are warming and that computer simulations have been spot-on in their predictions. Simply put, the Earth is warming and the models got it right. But that said, reaching almost 1.5 degrees Celsius with only about a 45% increase in the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere means that the contrarians, like Roy Spencer, John Christy, Richard Lindzen, William Happer, and Judith Curry, are shown conclusively to be wrong. The rate of warming we are seeing, in both the air and ocean temperatures, is inconsistent with the fanciful and optimistic beliefs of this group. But not only does the Earth not care about the contrarians; the weather doesn’t either. And it has been a crazy year with many climate-change induced weather events that should give us all cause for concern. We know that a warming climate will have many weather effects. For instance, in a warming world, there is increased evaporation which tends to dry out areas and make droughts worse. But, in some parts of the world, the warming air has more water vapor (higher humidity) so that heavy rainfalls occur and more flooding happens. The general rule of thumb is that areas which are currently dry will become more dry. Areas that are currently wet become wetter. And rains will occur in heavier downpours. And that is just what we are seeing. In the United States, we have had a continuation of the terrible drought in California. We’ve had a new heat-wave drought in the southeastern part of the US and that led to terrible wildfires. There have been terrible floods in other locations, including Maryland, West Virginia, Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi, Iowa, among others. Outside the US, there has been an incredible heat wave in the Arctic which has led to the lowest ever wintertime ice ever recorded there. The Arctic is looking very precarious for the important summertime low ice extent. We have a good chance at breaking the record (again). Terrible flooding the UK, Myanmar, Argentina, Indonesia, Spain, and Egypt, and others. There have been simultaneous flooding and heat waves in Australia, crazy hot weather in India and the Middle East. And typhoons and hurricanes are getting stronger because of climate change. As we warm the planet and its oceans, there is more energy available to fuel these hurricanes. According to expert Jeff Masters, 2016 saw the strongest storms ever observed in two regions. We also witnessed seven Category 5 storms, which is a huge number. Among typhoons that hit land, two of the top five occurred this year. These listed weather events, which are increasing, have been predicted to be an outcome of global warming. The scientists making these predictions got it right. The Ugly One of the two events in this category should come as no surprise – the election of Donald Trump. While I continue to hold out hope that Trump will take climate change seriously, he is surrounding himself with people who are not scientists – rather, they are advocates for the fossil fuel industry. Many have histories of not only denying the science but working to undermine the science and the scientists who study climate change. There is very little evidence that Trump or his administration will take climate change seriously. However, there are rumors Trump’s daughter may be more understanding of science. There is also the possibility that Trump will realize he is in a powerful position, a Republican President with a Republican Congress. If he realizes the economic and social peril that climate change poses, he may take it upon himself to be a savior of sort for the world. If, on the other-hand, he kills climate funding, pulls us out of our international agreements, and goes backwards on our own emission reductions, we will see a devastating effect for our climate and a probable rise in energy prices. It would be so ironic if, for instance, energy prices are higher in four years than they are now. The second ugly event is the continuation of the ubiquitous misinformation on climate change. With the reduction of responsible and professional staff and organizations, news has been abdicated to second-rate non-reporters. Some examples are David Rose from the UK who writes for The Mail on Sunday. In November he wrote an article wherein he claimed that the recent record temperatures were a result of El Niño, not global warming. His fake news article was embarrassingly wrong. You might have thought Mr. Rose was a climate scientist by reading his article, but he ignored 7 out of 8 climate records, he focused on a portion of the atmosphere and threw out out most of the warming data, he cherry picked his data set, ignored records set without El Niño, and he omitted the entirety of the Earth’s oceans in order to get his result – and he was still wrong. But, when articles appear in newspapers, even ones like The Mail, they have a veneer of credibility. Simply put, the reason 2014, then 2015, and now 2016 are all-time records is that we have emitted heat trapping gases. Rose is full of baloney. But misinformation wasn’t limited to the UK, it had its normal huge presence in the US. In the Wall Street Journal, contrarian Roger Pielke Jr. published an article where he described himself as a climate heretic. His name might be familiar as a former writer for Nate Silver’s 538 blog before they rapidly parted ways. Pielke claims that he was attacked by “thought police in journal, activities groups funded by billionaires, and the White House”. What Pielke didn’t tell his readers is that he threatened colleagues who dared to confront his faulty science (For which Nate Silver apologized). He also wrote misleading pieces that discussed tsunamis, volcanoes and earthquakes as though they were weather events (or at the very least, he failed to distinguish the difference to his readers). They are not weather events. Roger Pielke Jr’s problems were of his own making by poor science and shoddy professionalism. There are many other examples including those of second rate scientists or non-scientists finding high-profile media venues to spin their fantasies. It has become harder for readers to discern the real from the fake, the low from the high quality, the good from the fodder. And this issue brings me to the end, and my hope for 2017. Hope for 2017 After this year of fake news in US politics and elsewhere, I am hopeful that consumers of news will become much more discerning. I am hopeful that people who were duped this year will have higher standards next year. I hope that the thirst for reputable news and responsible sources will revitalize news media in the US. In particular, I hope that we see a resurgence in real reporters. People who have a professional obligation to get things right. People who live and die by their reputations and therefore cultivate those reputations. I understand that the Washington Post is actually hiring news reporters. This is unheard of in US print media but I hope it is a harbinger of things to come. If news consumers ask “where is this information coming from?” “Is it reputable?” “Can I double-check this article?” “What conflicts of influence might be present with this reporter of news?” Then, 2017 will be a glorious year and set us on a path of recovery. I am also hopeful that the economic position of renewable energy continues to improve. If so, the president of the USA won’t matter. We will be on a path to a cleaner safer world just based on unstoppable economics.

But while acting may seem an unusually insecure and unpredictable profession, if health and luck hold out then it can extend well beyond your 60s. The opportunities are tantalising, whether it’s Glenda Jackson playing King Lear at the Old Vic last year, Caryl Churchill continuing to write testing plays with older characters, or the upcoming production Lost Without Words, an improvised show for actors in their 70s and 80s created by the National Theatre and Improbable. I met up with three actors who are all still embracing challenging work in their 80s and asked them what kind of career they thought they might have at the start, and how they have survived it. Siân Phillips, unusually, burst into stardom and is a star still. Timothy West needed age to catch up with his natural air of authority, while Janet Henfrey has from the beginning been a character actor. Each speaks most lovingly of the theatre, though television gave them additional lustre. Phillips, rebuilding her career in the wake of divorce, found acclaim as the poisonous Livia in I, Claudius. West earned respect as historical figures such as Edward VII and Winston Churchill. Henfrey embodied Dennis Potter’s fears as the humiliating schoolteacher in The Singing Detective. Phillips describes her precocious entry into performing. “My mother taught me to recite,” she says, “and I started performing when I was about four. I worked all through my childhood at the BBC.” Even so, she says, “nobody wanted me to go into the profession. They thought I was completed unsuited temperamentally. What did they know about it, up a mountain in Wales? But everyone thought I was not tough enough to take the reversals.” The playwright Saunders Lewis, who wrote especially for her, urged her to go to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada). “He wrote to me, ‘you have to learn to live on the knife edge of insecurity.’ But everything turned out to be very easy. There were no reversals. I didn’t have to learn to deal with unemployment.” Henfrey and West (whose father, Lockwood West, was also a notable actor) both defied parental disapproval to act. Henfrey was tutored by Iris Murdoch at Oxford and initially hoped to work for the UN. On an exchange year in America, she shook hands with the young JFK. But when she joined Rada, she felt: “I’d come home.” There, she learned to bypass her academic instincts – her tutor Nell Carter, a star of the Edwardian stage, implored her: “Janet, don’t be so logical!” Like most actors of their generation, Henfrey and West began in regional repertory theatre. Henfrey “wrote letters to every rep in the country”, and ended up “playing old ladies” in Pitlochry. This lost world provided an invaluable training for West, who didn’t go to drama school. Fortnightly rep – two weeks to rehearse, two to perform – offered over 20 productions each year, requiring “a variety of style, text, manners, accents”. He even survived weekly rep: “We didn’t do it very well, but we did it.” At Salisbury in 1957, a bold director introduced two weeks of rehearsals: “Some of the older actors muttered, ‘what are we going to do with the second week?’” Henfrey’s first job was as an assistant stage manager for a play starring Phillips. She quietly forged her own path, securing work and negotiating wages – “I didn’t have an agent for my first 10 years in the business. I felt very pleased with myself when I got [producer] Michael Codron up by five pounds.” What shape did they imagine their careers might take? “In those days you didn’t see much further than the end of your nose,” West says. “If you were in rep in Lincoln, you might look to get to Liverpool. If you were in Liverpool you’d look to Bristol – because producers came to Bristol, so you might slip into the hallowed West End. Nobody gives a toss about the West End now, but in those days you were lucky if you made the leap. No shame if you didn’t – there were people doing rep all their lives, sometimes in the same place.” From the beginning, both Henfrey and West played characters far older than themselves. “The first part I played of my own age was the stage manager in [the original production of] The Dresser,” Henfrey says, while West feels his casting was “a cheap option” for penny-pinching reps. “I don’t know what it is – Michael Billington always says I’ve got ‘bottom’, which I think he means as a compliment. It’s a solidity and weight but means I’ve never played parts like Hamlet or Romeo.” Nor did his hero, Ralph Richardson, who “excelled in playing really dull people. There was no concession to their dullness, but, gosh, it was riveting to watch. I’ve never wanted to do ‘great acting’, I leave that to others. I try to play truthful acting.” Phillips, meanwhile, sailed straight into leading roles: St Joan, for example. Her cheekbones are still a marvel, but “my looks were never my fortune”, she says. “I was an unfashionable looking girl, tall and dark and my hair was all wrong. Pretty girls of my period had fair hair and curls and were shorter than me. Then I had a bad car accident which smashed my face in, but I can’t remember worrying about it for one second – I just thought I’d do different parts.” What derailed her, she says simply, was that “I got married”. Her husband, Peter O’Toole, was himself a bright star, but reluctant to share the limelight. “It was in many ways a disaster, professionally, because everything that I’d built up was destroyed very quickly. I lost all my contacts, I had to break contracts. I felt very isolated. Having had everything at my feet, I had to do quiet, low-key things which didn’t attract attention to myself – which is harder than you think! Once or twice something became a big success, which was disastrous.” That period, she admits, “did clip my wings. I was in my early 30s, which are the big years for an actress, but realised that I wasn’t going to be able to do the things I should be doing. But I thought the worst thing would be to get bitter and miserable, so I thought: I won’t do that, I just won’t.” Even so, she says calmly, “for years and years I led a very solitary life. I didn’t let it sour me, but in the end I realised it had to stop. That was hard.” She left O’Toole (they divorced in 1979), and flung herself back into work. “I had to make a lot of money quickly, because I was penniless. I had to buy a house, furniture, clothes, and I had to do it fast.” West would later have his own hair-raising encounter with O’Toole when, as director of the Old Vic, he cast the loose-cannon star as a calamitous Macbeth. A more frequent and less lurid frustration was typecasting. “Sometimes I felt: come on, they ought to be giving me something more interesting. There was one director who would only cast me as a middle-aged gay man – lovely parts, but he wouldn’t touch me for anything else. I like challenges.” He admits to short periods of “despair about ever getting another part. I think I inherited that from my father, who constantly said, ‘There’s been a conspiracy to keep me out of work. I’ve been boycotted.’” Except for a fortunate few, acting doesn’t make your fortune. As a single parent, Henfrey says “it was very hard until I had a home of my own. I didn’t have a base, so when I didn’t have a job there was a whole identity crisis.” Before that, she was renting a basement room in west London – affordable only because it was supposedly uninhabitable. Without a home, she says gravely, “I don’t know how you don’t go insane.” Of the three actors, she is the only one to admit to thinking hard about leaving the profession, as long as she could find “something real and useful”. She is politically active, explored speech therapy and enjoyed teaching voice – she was on the brink of accepting a leading management role when cast in a TV adaptation of Alice in Wonderland. Even after the success of The Singing Detective, she tells me, she didn’t work for a year – and was repeatedly cast as teachers. So how do you stay sane in the face of uncertainty? “I always advise young actors to have a second string that they’re not committed to,” she replies. “If you’re not obsessed with this profession, you’ll never survive.” If acting offers a hazardous career, it values experience. All three interviewees have recently enjoyed some of their most challenging roles. Henfrey navigated the fiendish text of Caryl Churchill’s Blue Heart (“challenging, stimulating and perplexing”), while West, remarkably, played his fourth King Lear, during the EU referendum: apt for a tragedy, he says, about “tearing up the map, old people making a disastrous decision and letting the younger people sort it out”. If Phillips felt that she missed a swath of her career, she has made up for it in recent years with, she calculates, 11 theatre productions in succession, embracing physical theatre with Frantic Assembly, an unusual geriatric take on Romeo and Juliet (in Bristol) and, most recently, the four-hour epic Les Blancs at the National Theatre, directed by South African Yaël Farber. “I thought I’d met every kind of director known to man,” she muses, “but I hadn’t met anyone like Yaël. She’s so demanding and difficult. To this day I can’t work out what she does, but she’s a brilliant director.” Both Phillips and West have since been followed by their children into a profession that depends on waiting for the call. I ask all three actors if there has ever been a point when they have felt captains of their destiny – and all three brush the question aside before I finish speaking. “No, never,” West says. “I don’t think any actor would ever say that – you’re always looking for the next thing, nothing is permanent.” He reflects for a moment, then adds, “I think we prefer it not to be permanent.” In this nerve-shredding trajectory, what is the satisfaction of acting? “I can’t imagine ever being bored with a part,” Phillips maintains. “When you think of the impossibility of becoming another person for every second that you’re on stage, it’s very unlikely that you’re going to do it – but it’s fun to try.”','https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jan/02/actors-careers-sian-phillips-timothy-west-janet-henfrey','Older actors weigh up their careers: \'If you\'re not obsessed, you\'ll never survive\'',318,'stage'),('lifeandstyle/2017/jan/02/new-years-resolutions-out-with-the-old-in-with-the-new','Here we are again, another year, another chance to change some things and preserve others.

Have your say below','https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jan/02/new-years-resolutions-out-with-the-old-in-with-the-new','New Year’s resolutions: out with the old, in with the new',319,'lifeandstyle'),('books/2017/jan/02/did-marie-kondos-spark-bring-me-joy-','There is an accepted principle in cinema that, since the sequel always outstrips the original in box office sales, all successful films must be traduced by cupidity in the making of a mark two (exceptions, of course: Star Wars, Toy Story). This applies, too, to bestselling books, but the difference is that books often sell well for peculiar and unique reasons. An original idea – narrated S&amp;M, for example, or radical tidiness – can never have the same impact again, because an idea cannot be novel twice. EL James redid Fifty Shades of Grey twice over anyway, and there was a cynicism to it. Good luck to her, frankly; the publishing industry ignored her for a long time, and the offer of untold riches must have seemed like sweet revenge. Spark Joy, by Marie Kondo, is different. She is cashing in, she can’t not be, and yet remains possessed by a zealot’s righteousness, so that, if anything, her philosophy is delivered with even more conviction than it was the first time. Kondo’s first book, The Life Changing Magic of Tidying, sold 5m copies, having come out in English in 2014. With energetic rigidity, she spelled out her terms: there’s no point tidying a bit. There’s no point cleaning before you tidy. There are no half measures. Everything in your home must bring you joy and, if it doesn’t, bin it. Be ruthless with your sloppy side. Imagine your ideal home and, if it has no stuff in it, you could achieve that home by getting rid of your stuff. Spark Joy, her follow-up, was published at the beginning of this year, and has since boosted her total sales to more than 6m. It makes no claims to originality; she hasn’t diversified into mind-tidying or decluttering your lower intestine (and indeed, it’s hard to see how she could have done, since by her rationale, a tidy home is a tidy everything). Instead, this is “in-depth” and “illustrated”, which is to say, “the same, with pictures”. Kondo’s repetitiveness is beyond shameless, she does it with gusto. “Finish discarding first,” she writes at the start of chapter two of Spark Joy, “I’m sure you know by now that this is a cardinal rule of the KonMari method.” Well, yes. Not only because it was the substantive principle of the first book, but also because it was explored at length in the first 20 pages of this one. But does it work? To treat our minds like our crud-filled apartments, let’s start with paring the KonMari method to its bare essentials: you cannot be tidy for life until you have done one defining tidy, which may take you many months. Pick up everything you own and ask whether or not it brings you joy. Do it by typology and not by room – clothes, books, komono (miscellany), sentimental items. You will be left, if you have anything resembling functional joy-judgment, with very little stuff, which will be brilliant for your house. In the first book, there was a charming memoir element: the recollections of a person totally without self-awareness – who learns to tidy first by chucking out her own stuff, then by chucking out all her sister’s stuff – is astonished to find that her sister doesn’t like that very much and, while utterly unrepentant, decides for efficiency to refine her methods by concentrating on her own stuff. But there was also a fascinating practicality to it; a way to pack (rolling up clothes, for instance, for a bird’s-eye view) that was satisfying. For 15 minutes, it is quite fun. Then the joy filter fails: tights don’t bring me joy. But if I didn’t have any, that would bring me a lot of un-joy. Indeed, if I chucked out everything but joy-generating clothing, I would be left with one cardigan and I would have to stay in. So naturally, now I have to redefine “joy”, and here I would have a lot in common with Kondo, who redraws boundaries ceaselessly to uphold her creed. It’s not a “rebound”, it’s “temporary clutter”. It doesn’t have to be “joy”, it can be an item so useful that you find joy in its use (in one memorable anecdote from Spark Joy, she throws out her screwdriver because it’s not joyful enough, then breaks her ruler trying to use it as a screwdriver). “This almost reduced me to tears, as it was one I really liked.” Well, obviously; all the ones you didn’t really like, you’d already thrown out. If you are a very fastidious person, using a treasured tool for a totally inappropriate task seems to me to be a recipe for unhappiness. An unforgettable tip of Kondo’s from the first book is to empty your handbag at the end of each day, wrap it in some nonsense fabric as a mark of respect, and give yourself the gift of tidying all the stuff you just evicted. When I read this, I speculatively put my hand to the bottom of my handbag and found a cocktail sausage, whereupon I did what any normal person would do and popped it in my mouth. All I mean to convey by this is that some people are starting a lot farther away from Kondo than she could imagine. Spark Joy extends the original proposition partly with diagrams (the clothes-books-komono-sentimental rule has been audaciously padded out with naive drawings of the items), partly with philosophising (the god of tidying will never desert you), and partly with further explication. Tidying relates to objects, cleaning relates to dirt. There is a fascination in other people’s domestic arrangements that goes beyond any interest in interiors, but I’m not sure that we delve entirely for the purposes of self-improvement. You’ll have noticed the flaw; this person has written a book about ridding yourself of extraneous stuff that is, itself, utterly extraneous. The brass neck of it brings me a complicated joy. I think I’ll keep it.','https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/02/did-marie-kondos-spark-bring-me-joy-','Did Marie Kondo\'s Spark bring me Joy?',320,'books'),('world/2017/jan/02/pogues-frontman-shane-macgowans-mother-therese-dies-in-car-crash','The mother of The Pogues frontman Shane MacGowan has died in a car crash in the Republic of Ireland. Therese MacGowan, 87, was killed when the car she was driving struck a wall in Ballintogher on New Year’s Day, police said. MacGowan, the car’s sole occupant, was pronounced dead at the scene near her home in Silvermines at about 3pm, they added. A spokesman for An Garda Síochána, Ireland’s national police force, said the crash was being treated as an accident. “It would appear to be a single car collision with a wall,” he said. MacGowan’s body has been taken to Limerick University hospital, where a postmortem will be carried out on Monday. She had two children, Shane and Siobhán, with her husband Maurice. The couple met in Dublin and moved to England, and Shane was born in Kent in 1957. They later returned home to Tipperary, where Shane spent much of his childhood. Shane, 59, was the lead singer of Irish punk band The Pogues. The group is known for hits such as Fairytale of New York and A Pair of Brown Eyes. It has been reported that the singer has recently suffered poor health. Last year he was rushed to hospital after he broke his pelvis during a live performance.','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/02/pogues-frontman-shane-macgowans-mother-therese-dies-in-car-crash','Pogues frontman Shane MacGowan\'s mother dies in car crash',321,'world'),('world/2017/jan/02/myanmar-to-investigate-video-of-police-beating-muslim-minority-rohingya-villagers','Myanmar is to investigate police officers who were filmed beating Rohingya villagers, an unusual admission that security forces may have carried out abuses against the Muslim minority. The office of Aung San Suu Kyi, the country’s de facto leader, said action would be taken after a YouTube user called Rohingya Blogger posted the video over the weekend. At least four officers have been detained, a statement said. Filmed by a police officer smoking a cigarette, it shows his colleagues kicking two men sitting on the ground and using a baton on them, while dozens of other male villagers sit alongside with their heads down. The Rohingya are a minority of about a million people who, despite living in the country for generations, are treated as illegal immigrants and denied citizenship. The government and nationalist Buddhists have persecuted them for years. The Guardian has been unable to authenticate the video, because it was purportedly shot in Rakhine state, where the government is conducting an intense military operation and has blocked access for aid workers and journalists. Myanmar says it is responding to several Rohingya militant attacks that killed nine police officers on 9 October. The state counsellor’s office, run by Aung San Suu Kyi, said the footage was filmed on 5 November during a “clearance operation” in Kotankauk village. It named four officers in the video, including the one who filmed it. “Those who [were] initially identified were detained. Further investigations are being carried out to expose other police officers who beat villagers in the operation.” The state-run newspaper, the Global New Light of Myanmar, cited the police as saying the operation was launched in response to an attack by motorbike gunmen against police in which a lance corporal died. It said the police were acting on tipoff that militants were being sheltered in the village and that a man living there had distributed “placards containing fake information” used during a protest when foreign diplomats visited the area. The government had organised a trip for ambassadors to the area after embassies requested access. Rohingya rights activists say residents were ordered not to complain. The recent bloodshed is the most deadly since hundreds of Rohingya were killed in clashes in 2012 and more than 100,000 were forced into squalid camps. A further 50,000 have fled to Bangladesh since October. Last week, more than a dozen fellow Nobel laureates criticised Aung San Suu Kyifor the crackdown, warning of a tragedy that amounted to ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. The army and officials have always alleged they are following the law, despite satellite images of burned villages and numerous reports of rape, indiscriminate killings and attacks on civilians.','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/02/myanmar-to-investigate-video-of-police-beating-muslim-minority-rohingya-villagers','Myanmar to investigate video of police beating Rohingya villagers',322,'world'),('books/booksblog/2017/jan/02/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week','Welcome to this week’s blog, and our roundup of your comments and photos from over the Christmas holiday period. I’m loath to start the year with a complaint. It’s not as if I didn’t do enough moaning in 2016. Even so. 1,200 comments over the last two weeks? How can I hope to do those justice? Especially when so many were clever, intriguing, enlightening and/ or funny. Oh well. What follows is just a small selection of the many, many excellent tips and recommendations you provided. Oh and one post which we may regard as a warning from lonelybloomer: My notes on reading Moby-Dick this year: 11-Aug-16: Started Moby-Dick. Excited!! 17-Aug-16: No whale in sight yet. Weird. 30-Aug-16: Asked a friend who has read the book when does the whale arrive. Her responce: “lol wait till 15 pages before the end”. Frustrated and confused. 01-09-16: Maybe taking a break from Moby-Dick. 30-09-16: Attended the seminar on American literature. Had to lie that I have read Moby-Dick. During the confidential chat on a break, learned that nobody in the group has actually finished it (we’re in American Studies program). 05-Oct-16: Rory Gilmore has finished MB, and I have not. Ashamed. Starting again. 25-Oct-16: Taking a break from Moby-Dick to read I Love Dick. 15-Dec-16: Maybe I could finish it before the end of the year and thus make 2016 meaningful at least in some sense. 22-Dec-16: F** it. Life is too short. Booker winners time! Perhaps even better was the following response from interwar: I’ve heard that life can be rich and meaningful even for those who’ve never finished Moby-Dick. Touché! Here’s a more straightforward, but equally interesting suggestion from Fourpaws: I finished The Invention of Angela Carter by Edmund Gordon in the wee small hours and couldn’t put it down even knowing that there would be no happy ending. It’s an interesting book that delves into the world of not only Carter’s writing but also how she created herself and then did so again during her abbreviated life ... I don’t think you need to have read Angela Carter’s novels to enjoy this. It’s a good book if you like reading about the activity of writing and how an author develops their ideas and brings those to fruition. I still found a couple of things in the early part of the book a little uncomfortable, but after that Gordon seemed to delve more into Carter’s writing rather than the nitty gritty of her own personal life. Perhaps as she became more famous, she was more cautious about the information she imparted to friends. What shines through is how great a talent and intellect Carter was yet she failed to get the recognition during her lifetime that she deserved. It is such a shame that she didn’t win the Booker before she died. Shame indeed. We’ll have to try to look at Carter soon on the Reading Group. Also intriguing was Yosserian’s review of Michael Crummey’s Sweetland: Sweetland is a beautifully told, but uncomfortable lament for a disappearing Newfoundland; or even a bitter accusation. Full of history, of lost livelihoods; of ghosts… When I was in Channel-Port aux Basques, and Corner Brook - I had a number of melancholic conversations about Newfoundlanders feeling lost, and unlamented; this novel takes me right back then; and oddly/disturbingly feels more visceral than those conversations; makes me feel somewhat chastened, inadequate, in my own responses to real people’s lives. Maybe this is a function of novels – to reveal more about ourselves than we otherwise would know – but... well... as beautiful as that may be, its not always a comforting thought. So, a thoughtful, compelling novel.... Elsewhere, Vieuxtemps has been carrying out a task many of us dread: A terrible, brutal, cruel, merciless purge of my personal library removed 340 books from about 1,400. A little less than my goal of 400, but it will do. Besides slaying (some of) the paper hoarding dragon, I did manage to read Maugham’s “Christmas Holiday”, which is not really about Christmas, but about a young, sweet, bourgeois English chap that visits Paris for a Christmas weekend museum holiday, and hooks up with a depressed, hardened Russian prostitute. Not *quite* what I was expecting for my Christmas read, but, from Maugham, maybe I should haven’t expected bubbly times. It was still good; not great like Maugham’s best (which is probably “Of Human Bondage”) but still very well written. Recommended for Maugham fans. There were also lots of summaries of 2016 reading over the holiday period. VelmaNebraska, for instance, has been good and busy: Oh 2016! Since the summer, I have been mainly reading crime thrillers for diversion while travelling or winding down before sleep: Greg Iles’ The Quiet Game, James Lee Burke’s The Tin Roof Blowdown and Alafair Burke’s The Ex. I preferred the latter two (Iles’ hero was a bit too indestructible) and only just now realized that their authors have the same surname. It can’t be a coincidence that one of the characters in The Tin Roof Blowdown is called Alafair (have just googled, so you don’t have to - they are father and daughter - which I think is rather lovely). All three books are part of series, which I may return to, for comfort and ease of choice. But the book I’ve adored over the past few months, and find myself thinking about long after finishing, is Chris Kraus’s I Love Dick. How deceptive and sly, and smart and funny, it is. So too has MildGloster, who provided a list of hits from the year: Favourite fiction: Good Morning, Midnight by Jean Rhys, which I thought was an absolute revelation; its themes of female isolation and sadness I clearly found pertinent. Favourite non-fiction: A Room of One’s Own by Virginia Woolf. It is the sort of read that changes you, that you know you should be reading, and I would encourage everybody to read it for that reason; it’s important. Favourite autobiography: Clothes, Clothes, Clothes. Music, Music, Music. Boys, Boys, Boys. by Viv Albertine. Raw. Straightforward. Cool. And special mentions for some other books I thought were brilliant: A View of the Harbour by Elizabeth Taylor; Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell by Susanna Clarke; SPQR by Mary Beard; Childhood, Boyhood, and Youth by Leo Tolstoy; and Notes from Underground by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. All those impressive lists were also elevating for Applecake: Having read all these lists and totals, I need to start a reading diary in the New Year so I can join in next time around. I’ve read shed loads of books this year but probably couldn’t name half of them. I don’t know why I haven’t thought of keeping a reading log before.

They entered 2016 seventh in League One but fizzled to 14th in May. A Boxing Day win and Saturday’s 1-1 draw with Charlton Athletic, both at home, ensured sixth place this time and it would have been fifth but for an 89th-minute equaliser. Phil Brown, their manager, called it “a great advert for League One football and for the club”. Ten seasons ago they had a one-off campaign in the Championship while Charlton were in the Premier League. Brown, now in his fourth full season, got them out of League Two at the second attempt. If his success in leading Hull City into the top tier for the first time in 2008 may have gone to his head, Roots Hall has grounded him. Black overcoat, open-neck white shirt and hair amok define a man seemingly comfortable and popular in more modest surroundings. Their best crowd, 10,329, beat the 8,493 for Wimbledon on Boxing Day and Brown was “delighted we performed”. Anton Ferdinand, who joined from Reading in August and led the side, said “part of the reason for a very good game and some fantastic football was because it was packed to the rafters”. He had not seen that before. “Our disappointment at dropping two points means we’re going in the right direction,” he added. A 12-match unbeaten run has taken them up the table. Before it they were 22nd. In truth the very good game burst from a cagey first half, more depressing than pressing, as Southend in particular, in face of Charlton’s careful 4-1-4-1, were often careless in the comfort of easy possession. They did score their goal, though, as Simon Cox, half the front pair in a 4-4-2 with Marc-Antoine Fortuné, spun in a packed penalty area to surprise Dillon Phillips in goal. It bore the stamp of a man who bagged two of the three on Boxing Day. And before the interval Anthony Wordsworth, on the break, gave Phillips the chance to show his agility. It was a foretaste of a second half that was as end-to-end as the first had been middle-to-middling. By the 70th minute Ted Smith, with tip-over and parry, had denied Fredrik Ulvestad and Jorge Teixeira and, sensationally, Morgan Fox before Joe Aribo hit the bar to match the post struck by Stephen McLaughlin for Southend. Adam Thompson stood firm beside Ferdinand in weathering the storm and Michael Timlin’s elegance at left-back repeatedly caught the eye. From his free-kick to the sparkling substitute Jermaine McGlashan, Southend all but closed out the match, Phillips tipping Will Atkinson’s shot for a corner, from which Fortuné headed badly wide. In an instant Aribo was crossing at the other end and Andrew Crofts, captain and Welsh international, rammed in his first ever goal for Charlton in his 30th game. If this was galling for Southend, Brown did not argue with Smith’s naming as man of the match and, up to a point, Charlton’s deserving of something. He is a trainee, aged 20, standing or flying in for the injured Mark Oxley, and had been sick for several days. “He shouldn’t have played in truth but he stood up to it and grew as a man,” said Brown, who has selected a product of the club’s academy in each of his 195 games in charge. The result was also a blessing in the interests of managerial relationships. On 22 October Southend won 3-0 at MK Dons, ending Karl Robinson’s six-year epic there. This was his eighth match at Charlton, of which one has been won and three lost. Another defeat might have been too much for the owner. Roland Duchâtelet is on his eighth manager in three years and fourth of 2016. They barely have time to find the changing room, let alone lose it. Famous Belgians used to be the subject of a joke. Infamous ones are no laughing matter. In Belgium Duchâtelet founded the Vivant political party. His involvement at Charlton might fairly be called Mourant and its continuation proclaims more money than sensitivity. At least on New Year’s Eve this foul acquaintance could be forgot briefly by the 1,847 faithful who travelled here. As for Southend, beyond Swindon on Monday they may be filled to the rafters again for Sheffield United on Saturday. Talking points • Russell Slade was one of Charlton’s five managers in 2016. His 21 games, the most of anyone, produced five wins, only six defeats but 10 draws. Coventry City have snapped him up as their third manager of the season, following Tony Mowbray and Mark Venus. On Saturday, following an opening defeat, he was denied victory at high-flying Peterborough by an injury-time equaliser for 1-1. His record at Leyton Orient and, to a lesser extent Cardiff City, goes before him in credit. He is expected to sign Nathan Clarke, his centre-back captain at Orient, but not in time for Bolton’s visit on Monday. Coventry, 23rd in League One but not out of touch, have not been in the fourth tier since 1959. • Port Vale, under Bruno Ribeiro, made their best home start ever with six successive wins. On Boxing Day, after three defeats running and two points out of a possible 18, he resigned with Vale in 17th place in League One and no further home wins. Michael Brown, already assistant manager, stepped up as caretaker and gave them their seventh against Chesterfield. At 39 he is a Valiant indeed, still registered as a player, with three matches this season and only one yellow card. As his striker Tom Pope said, he will get Vale battling again. • What to do when a proven goalscorer becomes a serial fluffer? Norwich City’s Cameron Jerome averages roughly a goal every four games in over 450 appearances.On Saturday at Brentford he could have had four in one but missed the lot. Alex Neil, his manager, said: “I thought Cameron put in a good performance but just that final little bit when he needs to hit the target and score the goal was crucial for us. Unfortunately he wasn’t able to do that but it wasn’t for a lack of effort.” Nor was it for lack of chances. Norwich are surely better than eight defeats and two draws in their last 12 matches. Rotherham and Wolves come next. Neil deserves them but had better win. • Exeter City continue to show there is something to be said for sticking rather than twisting. They are the latest side to squeeze through the mid-table scrum in League Two with four wins and two draws in their last six games lifting them from bottom to 11th, five points off the play-offs. Their record remains extraordinary, with an eighth away win on Saturday, 4-1 at Newport County, and only one at home, in their last match at St James Park against Mansfield. On Monday they host Leyton Orient, where they won to start their unbeaten run. Orient have a new manager since then, Andy Edwards, their fourth in a year. Exeter have Paul Tisdale – in his 11th season. • Mansfield Town are not League Two’s lowest scorers. They lead Accrington’s 21 by one. But they were glad to end a drought on Saturday. It had lasted five hours 43 minutes, ending when Matt Green scored in the 59th minute against Doncaster Rovers, who needed a late penalty for a draw.','https://www.theguardian.com/football/football-league-blog/2017/jan/02/southend-charlton-league-one-roots-hall-phil-brown','Southend make it a dozen and counting despite Charlton’s late leveller | Jeremy Alexander',324,'football'),('commentisfree/2017/jan/02/payday-loans-capped-high-cost-credit','It’s not so long ago that newspapers were awash with horror stories of how payday loans were pushing people into dangerous cycles of debt and fuelling a raft of social problems. By helping thousands of people with payday loan problems, Citizens Advice saw at first hand the devastation caused by extortionate interest rates and the harassment waged on borrowers. Concerned by the behaviour of payday lenders – whose presence became ominously familiar in many a high street – we, along with other organisations, campaigned for robust political pressure to be directed at the scourge of payday lending. The result was tougher regulation, including a cap on the total cost of credit that came into effect two years ago, meaning people can’t pay back more than twice what they borrowed. The cap had an almost instant reaction – the number of people who contacted Citizens Advice with unmanageable payday loan debts halved within a year. The regulations also carried more stringent demands on lenders and the market is now working better for all – people can still get access to credit and fewer are having problems. Not all problems have been solved. The majority of lenders still do not ask for proof of income and expenditure. But the initial success of the Financial Conduct Authority’s intervention should not be understated. It is a handy reminder of the good work regulators can do when they are bold. Yet while a lot of issues have been tackled in the payday market and consumers are better protected as a result, other forms of high-cost credit, which can be just as damaging, remain untouched. Doorstep lenders, who lend money to people in their homes, are not included in the cap but charge eye-watering interest rates of up to 1,500% to the 2.5 million customers who currently use them. The rent-to-own market, which provides household goods on credit, is also not covered by the cap. Consumers face high interest rates and are also charged large fees for add-on costs such as insurance and aftercare, which can mean people end up paying two to three times as much for products as they would on the high street. One person we helped will repay £2,000 for a washing machine that originally cost £300. Customers are also hit with further penalties if they miss a repayment, and harsh debt-collection practices. Other debt firms also continue to impose higher interest rates than their payday counterparts. Logbook loans, where loans are secured against personal belongings like a car, come with interest rates of more than 400%. A man who came to Citizens Advice for help borrowed £800 only to find he faced a £5,000 final repayment bill. A better known issue is one faced by millions every year: people using unarranged overdrafts face similar problems to those who take out high-cost credit. A person with a £50 unarranged overdraft for a month can pay back far more than twice that in total. High-cost credit, however it is provided, can all too often lead to unmanageable debt. People can quickly fall into a debt trap, borrowing more to make repayments or falling behind on priority bills such as council tax or energy. Around a third of rent-to-own customers, for instance, have fallen behind on payments. Half have taken out other debts to make repayments, and 25% have stopped paying other bills as a result of missing repayments. Users of high-cost credit are also far more likely to be in insecure situations – and are more than twice as likely to have dependent children or have a disability than the general population. There is a moral case to protect those consumers who have little choice but to borrow from high-cost lenders. Two years on from the cap, the FCA is looking at how effective the measure was, and alongside this it is examining other high-cost credit markets to see if action needs to be taken there. This is a clear opportunity for the FCA to protect more consumers by applying the cap on the total cost of credit to all forms of high-cost lending. That way people will know from the outset what they are in for and how much they will have to pay back. The common argument against extending the price cap is that the market will collapse under tough regulation. The payday lending industry shows us that isn’t the case. Despite tough regulations and the introduction of the cap, responsible firms are still able to operate and make a profit without pushing people into unmanageable debt. It is easy to forget that the current approach to consumer credit regulation is relatively new. Lenders have only been required by regulations to conduct affordability checks on borrowers since 2011. The FCA needs to build on the success of payday regulation and give consistent protection to people, no matter where they borrow money from.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/02/payday-loans-capped-high-cost-credit','Payday loans are capped.

When my sister joined me for a short while in Argentina. We’d been there for two days and a man stopped on the side of the road and began speaking to us. He told us how he’d cycled around Spain last year then offered us his place to stay that night. When we arrived at his home, his mum greeted us with open arms and fed us so much food that we ate like kings for the first time in months. The following day we met another cyclist who invited us to his home for lunch and made arrangements with his friend for us to stay a day later. After a generous lunch, we went to his friend’s place and were stopped in the local town by a man who gave us a large bag of oranges. He, too, offered a stay in his home … This level of generosity shocked me to my core. I think we forget how giving people can be and how a kind stranger can look after you without expecting anything in return. It’s funny how kindness and a warm smile can be the highlight of your day. The low point? The moment that stands out was on day 16, just over two weeks in to my trip. I had been pushing my bike up the Ecuadorian Andes for four days; it was pouring with rain and I was extremely hungry. I had passed house after house of rejection: no one would help. Nothing. We reached a house and I fell to my knees in tears, begging the woman for help, even just her garden to put up my tent. She looked at me, looked at how desperate I was, the tears streaming from my face, and shook her finger. Nothing. I could do nothing and I felt like nothing. I dug deep to source any shred of energy or willpower to keep going. What’s your advice for anyone who wants to do a similar trip? If you’re planning a cycling trip, pack light. Very light. Weight will hold you back and you’ll be surprised by the amount of stuff you don’t need. Think practically and essentially. I would recommend Gore gloves and rain jacket as they are lightweight. I also loved my down jacket: it kept me warm and worked as a pillow too! Finally, it is important to keep positive. I was raising money for a charity called Operation South America and the thought of them got me through my darkest days. And download some motivational videos or podcasts.

Stepping off the plane in Brazil. I had no money, no contacts, no solid plans and 7,000 miles of mystery and wonder ahead of me through lands I’d never set foot on. With so many of us on a quest for more stuff and more money, this is a perspective on Earth that few of us get to feel. The low point? The daily challenge of finding a new source of food and water, a place to sleep, and a ride made the whole trip through South America strenuous. To hitchhike 7,000 miles when you don’t like cars isn’t always the most fun. One day in Peru I accidentally got off the Pan-American Highway and ended up in the middle of nowhere. It took me around 12 rides to go just 130 miles. But hitchhiking is worth it because it takes you to places and introduces you to people you never would have seen or met in any other way. What’s your advice for anyone who wants to do a similar trip? Be prepared and have the gear to be mostly self-sustaining. Carry a tent and sleeping gear, water purifier, cooking equipment and comfy clothes. Travel light and leave behind what you don’t need. Make connections for places to stay, and earn meals through websites such as wwoof.org, helpx.net, and workaway.info. Ditch your expectations before beginning the journey and keep an open and curious mind. • Read more about Rob’s adventures at robgreenfield.tv Rhinal Patel: travelled from her UK home to Hong Kong What was the high point of your trip, so far? There is no better feeling than when someone, without knowing who you are, holds out a hand to help you. One memorable experience was hitchhiking in Banda Aceh, Indonesia. My friend Paco went to ask an elderly Muslim lady how far the next town was and she looked at us like we were crazy (hitchhiking is not common in Indonesia). We started waving at the cars going past when suddenly she came over, calmly stood in the middle of the road and made a stop sign in front of a car going past. It stopped immediately, and she told us to get in. This old lady had more power and courage than most kids today! I was truly inspired and impressed. The power of social media also amazed me. People would find my blog online and contact me, inviting me to stay with them. The low point? The lowest point was in Germany, I had two days to get to Poland for my flight and I had planned to travel 300km across the north. On the way, a Brazilian guy who picked me up found out that there were growing neo-Nazi towns in the north and I could be entering a dangerous situation. I rerouted via Berlin, adding another 300km to my journey. I arrived late at a service station and decided it was too late to hitchhike, so I slept in the toilet. Then I got a message from someone in Berlin saying that he had read my blogand asked what he could do to help. I told him my situation and he offered to come and get me as well as pay for my bus ticket and a hotel. But before I could reply I lost Wi-Fi connection. I spent the next 90 minutes asking people if I could borrow a phone to call him: everyone said no. Finally, one girl agreed and we waited for her boyfriend to come out of the toilet so I could explain my location to my contact in Berlin. As soon as he came out the look on his face told me he was not going to help me, but I did not expect what was to come out of his mouth: “I am sorry we cannot help you. You might be trying to organise a bomb somewhere.” What’s your advice for anyone who wants to do a similar trip? There is the risk something bad can happen to a lone female hitchhiker, but it was important to me to show the importance of freedom and independence, especially for women. I did almost back out after hearing the story of Pippa Bacca (an Italian hitchhiker murdered in Turkey in 2008), but I decided to proceed with caution. I didn’t hitchhike at night with people I didn’t know and I started using other methods, like hitchhiking trains, car shares, or with friends of friends. Asking locals for advice, learning how to read people’s body language and researching countries beforehand is also important. Emotionally, you need a positive attitude and determination. You are going to hear “no” a lot along your way and sometimes dirty looks and nasty comments. But you cannot give up at the first “no” … try, try, and try again until you get a “yes”.You are much more likely to hitch a ride when you’re smiling than when you are down and depressed. Usually when someone does stop, it ends up being a beautiful experience. Sweden was a difficult place for me to hitchhike because of the prejudice that has developed there, but the best advice that someone gave me is: “Focus on your end objective and don’t let anything or anyone get in your way.” • To read more about Rhinal’s travels visit her blog tinyurl.com/rhinal or donate to her chosen charity at totalgiving.co.uk','https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/jan/02/how-to-travel-the-world-with-no-money-by-people-who-have-done-it','How to travel the world with no money – by people who have done it',326,'travel'),('books/booksblog/2017/jan/02/loves-work-gillian-rose-philosophy-books-of-defiance','The founding act of defiance for the philosopher Gillian Rose seems, by her own account, to have been against dyslexia. The discovery early on “that the desert of stony words could be made to bloom, that I could channel what I could not overcome” enabled her to embark on a life of intellectual adventure that combined forbidding academic rigour with a passionate, personal engagement in moral and ethical questions. Her intense and beautiful memoir, Love’s Work, records an experience of learning philosophy at Oxford so sterile she nearly abandoned the subject. Rose recalls being admonished to “remember … all the philosophers you will read are much more intelligent than you are”, but through a left turn into sociology she was able to relaunch her singular journey through speculative European thought. The books that followed included The Melancholy Science, an “introduction” to the work of Theodor Adorno that’s best read only after you know it; and The Broken Middle, a forbidding account of the impossible, unavoidable negotiation between the ideal and the singular, which manages to reveal a Kierkegaardian face to Hegel, and vice versa. This rewarding but rather terrifying work won her fans including Rowan Williams. These intellectual struggles are all – rather miraculously – alive in this laconic, lyrical autobiography. It describes a troubled childhood in a turbulent Jewish family where the trauma of divorce was loaded on to the emotional weight of history; it recounts romantic loves that are sometimes desperate, sometimes euphoric and offers vivid, tender and occasionally shocking portraits of her many friends. Throughout a career that ranged across thinkers rarely considered together, the work of Hegel was a constant: the knotty thinker who explored how every concept depends on its opposite; how truth is a moving target in an unceasing dialectic. And this defiantly difficult line of thinking, or something very much like it, seems to have informed her personal life. In philosophy and in private life, Rose takes as inspiration Hegel’s not obviously hilarious definition of comedy: “The comical as such implies an infinite lightheartedness and confidence felt by someone raised altogether above his own inner contradiction and not bitter or miserable in it at all.” (Rose adds a nuance: “No human being possesses sureness of self: this can only mean being bounded and unbounded, selved and unselved, sure only of this untiring exercise.”) This style of thinking, which defiantly refuses any easy certainty, is the key with which she unpicked a generation of contemporary philosophers, including Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault, to find their claims to have overcome western metaphysics actually recapitulate older forms of law. It also shows in her frustration with uncomplicated feminism, which she argues “fails to address the power of women as well as their powerlessness, and the response of both men and women to that power”. In spiritual questions, too, Rose insists on complication. Modern debates about faith neglect a protestantism shared by both sides, she argues – a protestantism that was the foundation of modernity. After all, it was to defend Christianity that Immanuel Kant constructed the Critique of Pure Reason – a foundational text of the Enlightenment. The book is also defiant in its treatment of the life crisis that set her writing: the discovery of advanced ovarian cancer. Her defiance here is not in any romantic “battle” with the disease, any embrace of alternative medicine or credulous faith in conventional doctoring, but in continuing to live, open-eyed, with remarkable vigour – a vigour she says left her friends distinctly unsettled. Love’s Work is no polemic, but there is a fierceness here that defies both conventional wisdom and readers’ self-reassurances. And also herself: Rose levels a flinty eye at her own exorbitant thinking, and remains ready to “tarry with the negative” in her seeking after the truth. “You are always stronger than yourself” is a refrain in these reflections. If there were a prize for the most challenging epigraph, Love’s Work would be a strong contender. Rose takes it from Staretz (in some accounts Saint) Silouan: “Keep your mind in hell, and despair not.” This is of course impossible wisdom, but Rose bore it with her, writing and thinking to the end. The cancer killed her, aged just 48 in 1995. But the defiant invitation to live and think and feel more deeply remains as urgent as ever. Her friend Geoffrey Hill wrote his poem Paideia in memory of a thinker who is only beginning to receive her due. It includes these lines: There are achievements that carry failure on their back, blindness not as in Brueghel, but unfathomably far-seeing. But Hill offers no easy consolation, concluding: “I find love’s work a bleak ontology / to have to contemplate; it may be all we have.” Love’s Work by Gillian Rose is published by NYRB Classics, priced £7.99.','https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/jan/02/loves-work-gillian-rose-philosophy-books-of-defiance','Love\'s Work: Gillian Rose\'s fiercely forthright life force',327,'books'),('sport/2017/jan/02/bold-sports-predictions-for-2017','Here are our bold predictions for 2017. Please note the bold (or should that be bold?) in bold predictions – these are to be taken with a pinch of salt. Especially the Tebow one. Kobe Bryant will return from retirement Few athletes are as prepared for a life after basketball than Kobe, a man of diverse interests and immense worldwide fame. Few athletes also are as ill-suited for retirement than Kobe, who burns to be on the court. These last few months away have to be killing him. He will mount a comeback, though probably not with the Lakers, who are building around a gifted young core of players. He’s always wanted to play for the Knicks. Would Phil Jackson dare drop him on the same floor as Carmelo Anthony? LC Tiger Woods will win again The notion that Woods could challenge for, let alone win, major championships was flawed even before his last and lengthy absence through injury. The depth of talent at golf’s summit means Woods will always be overawed and outplayed in such environments now. Still, he can and will win lower grade PGA Tour events. Woods has a propensity to prevail on the same courses, as shown by his record. He retains more competitive ability than some of those who win once or twice on Tour in any given year. If fitness troubles really are behind Woods, he will return to the podium. Then? Cue more major discussion. EM An American not named Serena will win a grand slam title Serena Williams did win Wimbledon six months ago, so let’s not put her in the ground just yet. But she’s now closer to 40 than 30 and there’s no question her stranglehold on the women’s tour was weakened during a year that saw the late-blooming Angelique Kerber win a pair of major titles to inherit the world No1 ranking on merit. The door has never been more open for the sport’s 90s babies. Garbiñe Muguruza and Karolina Pliskova took advantage in 2016; Madison Keys will follow this year. The 21-year-old from Illinois, who has played into the second week at the last six majors, has all the shots, and power on both wings. Look for her to put it all together and become the first American woman not named Williams to capture a major singles title since Jennifer Capriati in 2002. BAG A wildcard team will win Super Bowl LI The NFL playoffs do not favor wildcard teams. To win the Super Bowl as a wildcard you have to win on the road three straight weeks and beat three of the league’s top teams. That said, it has happened six times before. Three of the last 11 Super Bowl champions came into the postseason as wildcards and 2017’s will as well. With no great, dominant team, the path is wide open. The Lions stumbled late in the season but still have a potent offense and the Patriots would rather forget their Super Bowls against the Giants and Eli Manning. LC Villanova will finish the regular season undefeated The Wildcats have moved to No1 in the polls, but virtually no analysts predicted a repeat for a Villanova team that returned most of its title-winning 2016 team. Aside from a shaky performance against DePaul late in 2016, the Wildcats have been stellar this season. Josh Hart has been the best player in the country, Jalen Brunson generates offense at will when he has the ball and Villanova are hitting their threes – something they didn’t do until the tournament last season. Ken Pomeroy’s stats say the Wildcats have less than a 2% chance to go undefeated in the regular season, but with this team I like those odds. DM Sebastian Giovinco will return to Europe Arguably the best player in the history of Major League Soccer, Sebastian Giovinco has made himself a superstar at Toronto FC. But his success has come at a cost. Italy manager Giampiero Ventura, just like Antonio Conte before him, says the playmaker has no international future as long as he is a MLS player. And so Giovinco could be tempted back to Europe, especially with the 2018 World Cup coming into view. GR Tim Tebow will thrive as a baseball player At first glance, it seems that New York Mets farmhand Tim Tebow, super-athlete and light of all of our lives, sufficiently failed during his stint in the Arizona Fall League, and that’s probably because of his measly slash line of .194/.296/.242 over 70 plate appearances. Tebow did not hit a single home run, but he did “help save” a fan having a seizure, staying with him until the paramedics arrived, and so it’s probably safe to say that the outfielder is more Moonlight Graham than Babe Ruth, right? Not so fast: Tebow was competing against some of the best prospects baseball has to offer, and picked up steam as he went, finishing with an 11-game stretch where he hit .281 and posted an OBP of.425. In 2017, the Mets defy all logic and expectations by their May promotion of a surging Tebow to help with their sagging mid-week attendance. The Wilpons sell a package they call Tebow Tuesdays, which promises at least one pinch-hit appearance per-game and private autograph sessions for the first 50 to sign up. Tebow not only survives, but prospers, becoming a cornerstone in the Mets lineup as they win their first title since 1986. DL Tom Brady will finally show signs of age Tom Brady will turn 40 before the 2017 season. Saying a 40-year old athlete in a contact sport will look his age doesn’t seem especially bold, but in Brady’s case, it is. In his age 39 season this year, he’s the favorite for league MVP and is having one of the best seasons of his career. But Peyton Manning’s performance fell of a cliff from his age 38 to 39 seasons and Brett Favre’s did the same in the only season he opened as a 40 year-old. Maybe Brady stretches his youth a year or two beyond that pair, but the end is coming. Soon. Time, unlike the 2007 New England Patriots, is undefeated. DG Floyd Mayweather makes a face turn No one believes he’s really retired, even if more than 15 months have passed since he last climbed through the ropes. Not when one more fight could lift him to the singular mark of 50-0, one better than Rocky Marciano’s recognized paragon of fistic perfection. Not when he can effectively name his own price as a free agent, having fulfilled his six-fight contract with CBS and Showtime. Many insiders believe a rematch with Manny Pacquiao looms, which, despite the tart aftertaste of their first installment, would still be the second-richest fight in history. But it says here Mayweather will instead opt to fight Adrien Broner, an opponent who hardly deserves the opportunity but one who would allow Floyd to take on the unfamiliar role of good guy in the promotion. Eight-figure paydays weren’t the norm for Mayweather until he turned heel, trading in his polite and humble Pretty Boy Floyd persona for a pantomime villain whom more fans pay to watch lose than watch win. But just because he made the business decision to break bad doesn’t mean he doesn’t care about people liking him. By going against the one fighter in the world more disliked than himself, Mayweather will exit the game as the cowboy in the white hat. BAG Los Angeles will be awarded the 2024 Olympics Maybe this doesn’t qualify as a bold prediction, after all most of the other competitors have dropped out. But Los Angeles was once eliminated as a contender after the USOC chose Boston as the American city to push. It has never seemed like LA was a favorite of anyone to host the games for a third time. The other competitors – Paris and Budapest – are more appealing choices. And yet LA might be the perfect Olympic city. The facilities are already in place. It could probably host the Games next year. For this reason Los Angeles will be the safe choice. Probably the only choice. LC Ronda Rousey doubles down ... and wins big After being embarrassed by Amanda Nunes in Las Vegas on Friday, many have speculated that Ronda Rousey won’t fight again. She’s noncommittal but we say she will enter the octagon in the first half of the new year, before Conor McGregor even books another fight, and get back to her winning ways. It won’t be at 135lbs, however. Rousey will venture up to the featherweight division and chase down a fight with Cris ‘Cyborg’ Justino (presuming she available after a PED tussle with Usada) in a last ditch effort to rebuild herself as a competitor and secure one more big-money fight. JG The Washington Nationals will miss the playoffs Although the Nationals did win the NL East by eight games in 2016, repeating in 2017 will be substantially more difficult. They should not expect Daniel Murphy to have the monster season that he had in 2016. Washington was also reportedly chasing some bigger names this offseason including starting pitcher Chris Sale and closer Kenley Jansen, among others, but were unable to land them. While having Max Scherzer and Bryce Harper on a roster can make any team a playoff contender, there are questions surrounding their role players including an oft-injured Ryan Zimmerman and an aging Jayson Werth. With the Mets’ power arms returning from injury, and other NL teams including the St Louis Cardinals and San Francisco Giants making moves this offseason, the Nationals will have a rockier road to October. EF An NFL player will come out as gay An active NFL player, one known to casual fans, will come out as gay. As of now, the specter of Michael Sam, the defensive end who came out prior to the NFL draft and ended up never playing in a regular season game, looms over the league as a missed opportunity. Sam’s story isn’t one that anyone wants to see repeated. Because of this, I fully expect the first out athlete in the league to be someone who is already established as an NFL-caliber player and has had significant experience dealing with the national media, two advantages that Sam never had. HF The NHL takes actual steps to increase scoring Yes, I know. This is supposed to be a bold prediction, and suggesting that a pro sports league will try to boost offense doesn’t exactly sound like going out on a limb. Every league knows that scoring sells, and every league makes sure the rulebook encourages plenty of it. It’s sports marketing 101. But this is the NHL we’re talking about. The league has been talking about boosting offense for over two decades – literally – but they never actually do it. This year, the decided they’d tweak the goaltending equipment. Then, whoops, they didn’t make the adjustments in time, so nothing changed. That’s just how things go in the NHL. But I think this year could be different. Maybe it’s wishful thinking, but today’s NHL is packed with exciting young talent like we haven’t seen in a generation. Surely now is the time to let them shine. Surely now is when we’ll finally get some forward thinking from a league addicted to its past. Surely we can’t do three straight decades of plunging scoring rates while the powers that be twiddle their thumbs and wonder why ratings are down. Or maybe we can. But you asked for something bold. In the NHL, sadly, this qualifies. SM The Los Angeles Lakers will make the NBA playoffs I can hear you rolling your eyes through the computer. Real cute, but these predictions are supposed to be bold, right? The Lakers are currently only two games out of the eighth seed in the Western Conference. Granted, they are also only three games ahead of the cellar-dwelling Phoenix Suns, but that just goes to show you how mushy and undefined the bottom of the West is right now. Anyone could catch fire for a few weeks and find themselves volunteering to be demolished by the Warriors in four games this spring. The Lakers were hovering around .500 before Thanksgiving, then lost 12 of 13 during a brutal road trip made worse by injuries to Julius Randle, D’Angelo Russell, Nick Young, and Larry Nance Jr. A healthy Laker team still can’t play much defense, but they can score against anybody, as wins over the Warriors, Thunder, Rockets, and a short-handed Clippers team proves. Most importantly, they have as good a chance as anyone in the West basement. The Kings, Pelicans, Mavericks, Timberwolves, and Blazers all have true superstars, but what the Lakers can offer is something close to the team cohesion that defines the elite squads in the NBA. This is still a rough unit that is dragging a few ridiculous contracts down the court each night, but they have as good as chance as anyone right now.

Manchester United are looking pretty dandy at the moment but José Mourinho wants more. £145m worth of more, by the way of Antoine Griezmann and Saúl Ñíguez. Mourinho does not want a striker – saying he trusts Marcus Rashford to put the ball in the net – but he is mulling over whether to give Atlético Madrid the pennies they would demand to trigger the combined release clauses for the services of the pair, given they signed new contracts last summer. Meanwhile, Mourinho has gone stone cold on the idea of bringing defender Victor Lindelof to Old Trafford but he could be set lose centre-back Chris Smalling, with Everton sniffing around the England international. A good old-fashioned centre-back is all the rage again today, you see, with league leaders Chelsea readying their chequebook to sign Southampton’s Virgil van Dijk from under the noses of Manchester City, who remain keen. Those savvy Saints could cash in on £60m for the man mountain, who has been under-par in the last couple of matches. Chelsea can breathe of a sigh of relief too, with Diego Costa “very happy” at Stamford Bridge and set to snub any lucrative overtures from Chinese Super League outfit Tianjin Quanjian. Dimitri Payet is supposedly fed up of being West Ham United’s most valuable asset, and the Frenchman could return to his homeland, if Marseille can seal a sensational return for the winger. Payet, who only signed a new five-and-a-half year contract in February, is the subject of a “crazy project”, headed up by American businessman Frank McCourt. Marseille reckon a £32m bid could see him back to Stade Vélodrome. Liverpool have been whetting their appetite for new players too, supposedly scouting Norwich City’s Jacob Murphy for the past few months, with the aim of landing him in next couple of weeks before sending him back on loan. They are not in for Joe Hart, though, with the wacky races between Loris Karius and Simon Mignolet all part of Jürgen Klopp’s fun and games on Merseyside. Elsewhere, Henri Lansbury could send the East Midlands into a bit of a frenzy by swapping Nottingham Forest for Derby County in a £2.5m deal. The only stumbling block for Steve McClaren is that Watford have the eyes for the former Arsenal playmaker too. Meanwhile, Brighton goal-machine Glenn Murray could make his loan move from Bournemouth permanent for a cut-price £1.5m, and Peter Crouch could sign a new contract with Stoke City.

Otherwise I would get back after dark. I would walk back that distance with my son on my back.” For Ntsime, the arduous trek she and her son were obliged to take was yet another painful strain on top of the condition, for which she tested positive when she was pregnant with Motsamai. Now, however, a programme using mobile technology is making it easier for mother and son to access treatment for the virus. Developed by Vodafone in conjunction with the Lesotho Ministry of Health, the programme combines the mobile money service M-Pesa, which is used in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, with a smartphone app designed for healthcare professionals. Travelling clinics provide on-site HIV testing in Lesotho’s remote rural communities where mountainous terrain makes movement slow. Anyone who is identified as HIV-positive can register with M-Pesa and receive the funds needed to pay for transportation to a treatment centre. Their details are also simultaneously recorded on a central database so that future treatment and care can be planned, recorded and accessed in the field by healthcare workers using an app produced by the company’s charitable arm, the Vodafone Foundation, and Vodacom Lesotho. The service is oriented towards pregnant women, mothers and young children, who are among the most vulnerable groups in a society where as many as 5,000 children under the age of 14 are estimated to be undiagnosed and living with HIV. Andrew Dunnett, director of the Vodafone Foundation, said the programme was part of the company’s Connecting for Good programme, which aims to deliver public benefit through the application of technology across the areas of health, education and disaster relief. “Our initial assessment indicated that a combination of mobile technology, money, management and working with the right partners could deliver a significant impact in Lesotho, where nearly a quarter of the population is HIV-positive, many of whom are children,” he added. “HIV is an immense healthcare crisis for the people of Lesotho. This pioneering programme will ensure that thousands of mothers and young children in some of the poorest communities in the world receive the care and support they need.” For mothers like Ntsime, the clinics now mean that she and her son can get treatment within easier reach. “I don’t need to travel far with my son. We visit the mobile clinic once a month. I am grateful for all that is being done. The nurses have really helped by coming nearer to us,” she said, adding that her thoughts were now very much focused on his future. “What do I hope for him? I hope he [Motsamai] grows up and is healthy.”','https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jan/02/mobile-technology-takes-fight-against-hiv-in-lesotho-to-the-people','Mobile technology takes fight against HIV in Lesotho to the people',330,'global-development'),('film/2017/jan/02/martin-scorsese-silence-religious-epic','We all know how it is with Scorsese. At the core of his work is the solid-gold De Niro material with one foot in Marty’s Italian-American upbringing: Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, King Of Comedy and Goodfellas/Casino. Then a second rank of DiCaprio collaborations, offering a lower rate of return: The Departed, Shutter Island, Wolf Of Wall Street. Then there are the oddities – New York New York, Cape Fear and Hugo – where he feels miscast or lost as a director. Then there’s this final category – movies on the subject of religious devotion that gestated in Scorsese’s mind over years or decades: The Last Temptation Of Christ, Kundun and now Silence. These tend to be the Scorsese movies I only ever see once, feeling no compulsion to revisit or reassess them. I fear that Silence expired in the womb during that long gestation period. It is beautiful to look at, but feels inert, humourless and overly devout (to say nothing of over-long; Masahiro Shinoda’s 1971 adaptation got Shūsako Endō’s 1966 novel on to film using 30 fewer minutes than Scorsese). Perhaps that leap toward the devout is needed to savour it fully – and I found I couldn’t make it. I didn’t care: for me, Christianity is one of the Big Bs of violent colonial intrusion – Bullet, Bottle, Bacillus, Bible – and Silence has a “white saviour” complex it can’t shake. Also not helpful are the other distractions: US, English and Irish actors all playing Portuguese while speaking English in shaky Latin accents; and an American director, more comfortable with modernity, making an avowedly Japanese period movie, from a novel by a member of Japan’s Catholic minority, and with Taiwan standing in for Japan. Missionaries Andrew Garfield and Adam Driver come to Japan in 1639 in search of a mentor (Liam Neeson) who has vanished while spreading the gospel in hostile territory. Hunted, persecuted and subjected to the full-on Stations of the Cross, they veer close to sainthood in Scorsese’s taxonomy of salvation, suffering nights on cold stone and the dark night of the soul. The succession of cruelties inflicted – boiling, drowning, crucifixion – did not put me in a godly frame of mind, however, they just reminded me of more relentless and overbearing Japanese-endurance movies, like Unbroken or The Camp On Blood Island. Scorsese’s execution recalls big, boring, overly devout Vatican II-era Catholic Hollywood movies such as The Cardinal and The Shoes Of The Fishermen. It looks beautiful, but its diverse and clashing elements never wholly cohere into something dynamic or kinetic. Maybe a second viewing will change my mind – but, as with Temptation and Kundun, I suspect there won’t be one.

I’m proud to look around and, as that there are far too many non-fiction films to choose from, please forgive the omissions as I’m spoiled for choice by my inspiring film-maker colleagues. There are brilliantly energising films that have brought real-world justice, such as The Central Park Five (directed by Ken Burns, Sarah Burns, David McMahon) about five black and Latino teenagers wrongly convicted of raping of a white woman jogging in New York in 1989. In this category, I would also mention The Jinx (directed by Andrew Jarecki) about the real estate heir Robert Durst, accused of murder and the subject of a manhunt; and The Thin Blue Line (directed by Errol Morris) about a man sentenced to death for a crime he didn’t commit. And there are some films which have had such fantastically huge impact that I won’t mention here because so many people will know about them already. That list would be topped by Davis Guggenheim’s An Inconvenient Truth, about Al Gore’s mission to get the planet to wake up to global warming. The Up series (1964-present) To care for your fellow creatures is to want them to be happy and prosper, to want to change what is causing them to suffer. To see director Michael Apted’s series – which has followed the lives of 14 British children since 1964, when they were seven – is to be confronted by social inequality. You quickly realise the evil of imagining that life is played on a level field, and that individuals can be judged fairly, or at all. What’s shocking is to see how much is already determined by the time someone has turned seven. A fairytale of social inequality, this ongoing series, so groundbreaking in format and ahead of its time in every way, offers the clearest look at contemporary Britain. To know the world, its joys and its sufferings, is to want to change it. And this series, like the best work in any medium, helps me to know the world. The Gleaners &amp; I (2000) This might not quite fit the galvanising notion, but Agnès Varda’s film is no less vital a work. And, personally, I respond more to being gently inspired than harangued. My activism comes from my love for the world: I am a film-maker not an activist. I trust the audience and want to respect them by giving them the space to create their own meaning, their own responses. Varda travels the French countryside, as well as the city, to find and film various groups of gleaners as they hunt for food, knicknacks, and discarded items. Her film has me thinking, looking, experiencing – gleaning, in fact. Varda notes that her work is “another kind of gleaning, which is artistic gleaning. You pick ideas, you pick images, you pick emotions from other people, and then you make it into a film”. What I gleaned from this film helped me make my film Waste Land. Released in 2010, it focused on the lives of Rio de Janeiro’s rubbish-dump dwellers and inspired practical change throughout Brazil, as well as individual behaviour. When I think of what might flash before me on my deathbed, I hope it will be the impact of my film. The Invisible War (2012) and The Hunting Ground (2015) These films by the formidable team of director Kirby Dick and producer Amy Ziering don’t just tell riveting stories – they break those stories and follow them up, creating a massive impact and bringing positive change. The investigative reporting is as strong as the film-making, fearless and commanding. The Invisible War lifted the lid on sexual assault in the US military. It featured interviews with veterans recounting their assaults and identified common themes, such as the lack of an impartial justice system and reprisals against survivors. The documentary has been praised for its influence on government policies aimed at reducing rape in the armed forces. The Hunting Ground followed that up by transforming our understanding of sexual assault on college campuses – by arguing that educational institutions are failing to deal with it adequately. Lady Gaga co-wrote the song Til It Happens to You for the film. It was nominated for an Oscar and she performed it at the 2016 Academy Awards, notably introduced by vice-president Joe Biden in a rare political moment for the event. With her on stage, survivors of sexual assault revealed parts of their bodies with things like “Not your fault” written on them. It may not have won a gold statue but, for most viewers, it won the Oscars outright for its emotional power. The Farm: Angola, USA (1998) Everything you need to know about human justice is here in this film, directed by Liz Garbus, Jonathan Stack and Wilbert Rideau. Set in America’s infamous maximum security prison in Angola, Louisiana, the film follows the lives of six inmates who tell their own stories of life, death and survival in a place few will ever leave. It still makes me cry – not because of the cruelty of the legal system and its representatives, but because of the breathtaking grace of the so-called felons. The Act of Killing (2012) and The Look of Silence (2014) The first of Joshua Oppenheimer’s documentaries looks at the individuals who took part in the Indonesian mass killings of 1965–66. When Suharto overthrew Sukarno, the president of Indonesia, gangsters Anwar Congo and Adi Zulkadry took control of a powerful death squad and targeted communists. Anwar, who is said to have personally killed 1,000 people, recounts and re-enacts his killings for the cameras. The Look of Silence, meanwhile, focuses on the story of one man whose brother was murdered and who confronts his killers. It’s with the second film that these works resolve – and achieve masterpiece status in my mind. Both films take us out of any familiar territory, in terms of revealing our ignorance about Indonesia’s recent violent history and also the intensity and strangeness of the scenes. We are disoriented and yet the film-making is so powerfully crafted that we are utterly compelled by it, and forced to find our own moral and emotional bearings. As Joseph Conrad said: “To the destructive element submit yourself, and with the exertions of your hands and feet in the water make the deep, deep sea keep you up.” Bowling for Columbine (2002) Ideally, I would actually include everything Michael Moore has ever done, up to and including 2015’s Where to Invade Next, a sort of travelogue full of lovely inspirational stories about countries where things get done right. But Bowling for Columbine, about the 1999 high-school massacre, was the one which resonated the most emotionally for me. Sometimes we need these bright lights on a dark night. We gather together and remember. Good things can be accomplished, lessons can be learned. 13th and I Am Not Your Negro (both 2016) Two astounding new documentaries. The title of the first, by Ava DuVernay, refers to the 13th amendment to the constitution, which outlaws slavery in the US. The film progresses from that to the horrors of mass criminalisation and the prison industry. The second, by Raoul Peck, is narrated by Samuel L Jackson and is based on an unfinished work by James Baldwin about civil rights leaders Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King. These documentaries demand to be seen now. I don’t even want to delay you by listing any more. Just stop reading and track them down right now. This is your call to action. Go!

Not that I’m naive. I was there. It was all very well to sing along to All You Need Is Love, but it was never simple. The air reeked of sanctimony and hypocrisy and, as ever, the biggest, hardest egos surged to the top. We had Vietnam and the cold war and Charles Manson. It’s easy to look back with indulgence on those glory days of We Shall Overcome and Give Peace a Chance, of smiling flower children sticking daffodils into the barrels of soldiers’ guns, Rastas advocating the smoking of herb and the practice of sitting together and reasoning. It feels hard to imagine, after 2016, that love and peace was once all the rage. We do hate so much better now. The death threat has entered everyday discourse. Nice people on social media who I happen to know would not hurt a fly and are firmly against capital punishment: even they are at it. None of them means it. Some do though, like the far-right extremist who said “Britain first” as he murdered the MP Jo Cox in June last year. When Cox was awarded a posthumous peace prize, some people complained. Should only saints win peace prizes? Of course she deserves the prize. She was a good woman who died doing her job, trying to help people. But we don’t do shades any more. Intolerance is the new vogue. I made a neighbour cry not long ago because I mildly criticised a politician she likes. “That’s it!” said a friend, “that’s the last time I take his parcels in for him,” suspecting her neighbour had voted for the other lot the morning after 2015’s general election. We’re losing the knowledge of how to disagree peacefully. Never has keeping your mouth shut been more attractive, because never before in my lifetime has free speech been so endangered. Every pathetic maundering idiot is slammed into the grand, new, respectable stocks and pelted. People are destroyed because of what they tweet or blurt stupidly. Cox died because someone hated what she stood for. Hate permeates the zeitgeist like a smell we’ve got used to. It’s called by other names but it’s the same old thing, thriving on a massive dehumanisation of the other that spreads like mould. The scum enemy is vile and loathsome, and all the other words you might use of a cockroach, just as the Nazis did of the Jews. This year, against the prevailing grain, we should reclaim such terms as peace, goodwill and unity from soppy bathos, read them anew and mine their original strength. This doesn’t mean being an apologist for tyrants or appeasing genocidal bullies, who must always be confronted. There will be blood. This is the world and we’re human. But who was stronger than Martin Luther King? We need a new peace movement that aims to minimise violence wherever possible. It’s hard when you feel like smashing someone’s stupid face in. I feel like that all the time. But if we give in to the hate, we’re sunk . In my youth we would sit for hours on end, a whole bundle of us together in a smoky room, talking about anything and everything under the sun. We didn’t all see things the same way. We were just as messed up as any other generation. Peace, love and understanding was never more than a catchphrase. A whole load of hippy drivel was no doubt spouted in those times, but there was less hate in the air. Come together. If only. Instead, we’re all running away from one another very fast. Where are the holy fools, the peacemakers? All out of time, sleeping in a cave under the hills.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/02/mock-hippies-2017-peace-love','It’s easy to mock old hippies, but what 2017 needs is peace and love | Carol Birch',333,'commentisfree'),('fashion/2017/jan/02/style-resolutions-for-2017-tips-from-the-guardian-fashion-desk','I will dress weather appropriately Full disclosure: my style resolution isn’t exactly bleeding-edge fashion stuff. It’s more a way to make my day just that little bit better. I have a long history of dressing in a way that mismatches the weather in a spectacular way. If winter is about to turn into spring I will invariably be found in wooly tights. If it’s raining, there will definitely be some sort of suede pump on my feet. And as anyone who has spent any time with me knows, I have an aversion to proper winter coats. Not to mention umbrellas. But 2017 is going to be different. I will become one of those people who looks at the weather app before I get dressed and I have already invested in a coat – well, a jacket, anyway – that I actually like wearing and that keeps me warm. Revolutionary, I know. Let’s see how long it lasts. Lauren Cochrane I will stop buying going out clothes Elle MacPherson once told me that her secret to keeping in shape was that you should never eat more than you can fit in your two hands cupped together. This has haunted me ever since, because that’s not a meal, Elle! That’s a snack! Anyway, the point is, I have never been much good at doing anything in moderation. Which is why my wardrobes are packed tighter than a pair of size 25 jeans in January. Specifically, I have approximately 567 party dresses. Which is at least one for every actual party I will realistically attend in the next decade. Which means that the ones that are out of fashion now will be back on trend by the time I get round to them, if I play my cards right. Jess Cartner-Morley I will start to dress like a girl I have spent most of my career as a fashion writer wanging on about tracksuits, which is handy because tracksuits have also been in fashion. EastEnders’ Nancy, Caitlin Price, Adidas and their various collaborations. So next year I have plans to perform a volte-face by dressing more like a girl. A girl in the historical, archaically-defined sense of the word, which isn’t as unsisterly as it sounds, but rather a reminder that I have legs. Hell has always been tight clothing and suggestive hemlines but I have huge plans to try short skirts, dresses, tights and entry-level heels. I may even wear over-the-knee boots, which I accidentally did for a shoot earlier this year. While I’m here, I’m also planning to phase out white trainers and wear in my Doctor Martens (this may take a long weekend) and stop carrying such a huge bag around in case something unexpected happens. Essentially adopting a YOLO approach to my everyday. Morwenna Ferrier I will wear less black Black is easy, and the anonymity of it is comforting. It’s easy to collapse into an oil- slicked ocean of the colour as I have done in the past but next year I hope to change it up a bit. The problem with wearing brighter, primary colours has always been the issue of not wanting to look like a children’s TV presenter. Next year, though, I’m going to try and wear more warm colours: orange, mustard yellows, deep greens and dark blues. But I’m still keeping my black jeans on, OK? Priya Elan I will be more considered in my outfits I have always adopted a pretty uniform approach to my look. Buy lots of similar-ish pairs of trousers in black and navy (slouchy tailored or jogging-bottom styles), and pair with lots of similar-ish jumpers and tops in black, navy and grey. They all have subtle differences (trust me they do) but essentially I’m a pro at being able to get dressed in the dark and “miraculously” have everything work together. Well, this year I’m going to get outside of my comfort zone a bit and introduce some styles that will require a bit more consideration … a few patterns maybe, some brighter colours (screaming face emoji) … and, potentially, a silk shirt or two. You definitely can’t just throw on a silk shirt.

Best known now as the man who is credited with popularising the word “zombie” in English, Seabrook is what you might describe as a pretty juicy subject. An occultist who briefly hung around with Aleister Crowley, and whose other pals included Gertrude Stein, Sinclair Lewis and Aldous Huxley, he was also a one-time cannibal and sexual sadist who liked to hang his female “research assistants” from the roof of his barn. The son of an itinerant Maryland minister, Seabrook began his career as a reporter in Atlanta and New York. However, in 1925, he gave up the newspaper life and headed to the Middle East, where he lived with the Bedouin, the Druze and the Yazidi of Iraq, experiences he recounted in his first book, Adventures in Arabia. A surprise bestseller, he followed it with further volumes about Haiti (The Magic Island) and Africa (Jungle Ways).&nbsp;Both bulged with wild exaggerations. He claimed, for instance, to have eaten the flesh of a human being in Liberia, when in fact what he had been given was ape (only later, in Paris, did he really eat human meat, purloined for him by an associate who worked at a morgue). But they made him briefly famous, and the journeys involved in their creation helped to keep at bay the deadening ennui and lack of&nbsp;self-esteem from which he would suffer throughout his life. By now, however, Seabrook was a raging alcoholic. Increasingly desperate, in 1933, he checked himself into an asylum in the hope of drying out. This gave birth to another book – his treatment involved being wrapped for days at a time in wet sheets, an experience which, thanks to his fetish for bondage, he rather enjoyed – but he did not manage to stay off the booze for long. His final decade was one long hangover, punctuated by episodes of violent self-harm. (He once pushed his hands into scalding water, believing that if they were badly burned, he would not be able to pour himself a whiskey.) Ollmann spent 10 years researching Seabrook’s strange, ramshackle life, and it shows: his book is wonderfully rich and detailed. Nothing seems to escape his attention or his compassion, whether we’re talking about Seabrook’s interest in S&amp;M (Ollmann traces it to his childhood) or about the long-suffering women in his life (Ollmann sees things from their side, too, even as they enable his drinking). His drawings of Seabrook, blunt-lined and scratchy, are a perfect match for his personality, which is at once charming and repulsive, fascinating and frustrating, while his depictions of such things as camel raids and tribal dances have a romantic, overblown quality, almost as if they are only figments of Seabrook’s imagination. In a way, of course, they are. In the end, this is not so much a simple biography, as a book about writing, and just how painful it can be when the words on the page don’t adequately match the pictures in a man’s head. •&nbsp;The Abominable Mr Seabrook by Joe Ollmann is published by Drawn &amp; Quarterly (£18.99).

The excuses are: there’s no time, you’re tired, you need to ”switch off” in the evening. It’s time to get serious in 2017! Cancel that gym membership, remove all trace of kale from the blender and make some new year reading resolutions instead. I did exactly this at the start of 2016, when I was asked about my favourite authors. I smugly reeled off a list of names, displaying my immaculate taste and erudition. “Where are the women?” asked my inquisitor. I was confused. “On your list,” she said. “Where are the women?” I laughed and nodded, but left in a fit of panic. I read women, didn’t I? What kind of Gay Talese-type man monster would I be if I didn’t? So I examined my bookshelves for sexism and the result was desultory – barely a woman in sight. I was only in love with men, uxoriously devoted to William Gass and Stanley Elkin, to the point where the likes of Angela Carter and Mary Gaitskill didn’t get a look in. Was it purely taste? Was the type of fiction I adored intrinsically male? It was time to make amends: 2016 was my year of reading women. I had just read an essay by the author Ben Marcus, who, while defending the pleasures of avant garde fiction from the middle-of-the-road scorn of Jonathan Franzen, referenced many female writers I didn’t know. As a result, I got hold of Kate Braverman’s Lithium for Medea, a forgotten classic that is raw and honest, and her icy prose was as tough and beautiful as anything I’d read. After that, I became obsessed by the complex, fabulist tales of Mary Caponegro; a student of John Hawkes and Robert Coover, she talks about the male domination of avant fiction and her “wish to feminise the legacy of her mentors”. Caponegro is an important masthead for bold, adventurous fiction, flying her flags within flags higher and more meta than most. I was on my way. Jenny Diski’s cool brilliance was revelatory, Kathryn Davis’s irrealism a joy. Through the brilliant publishing project Dorothy, I discovered Joanna Ruocco, whose remote, repeating style unsettled and thrilled in equal measure. By spring, I was joyfully tumbling down the rabbit hole and greedily grabbing all I could. I was staggered by Jane Bowles and Joy Williams, awed by Lynne Tillman and Lorrie Moore, blown sideways by ZZ Packer. When Flannery O’Connor got lost in the post, I took solace in Deborah Eisenberg instead. I could go on. I did go on. The cliche that women writers ignore grand themes in favour of lighter motifs is woefully fallacious. Williams’s The Quick and the Dead and Lydia Millet’s LA cycle of novels are ambitious works of moral philosophy, books that scorch the soul and leave you weak-limbed and thirsty. Likewise, I found no preoccupation with domesticity, another common charge. The characters I read were lost and isolated, detached from family, surviving – or not – in a wider socio-political world. I had found women writers I loved; life-changers. I am truly a hetero-reader at last, both shamed and enlightened. So take it from me, reading resolutions work. They’re worth doing. And now it’s your turn. Make this year a year to read more women or finish more giant-sized classics, or perhaps read the entire Booker winners list. What are your suggestions for reading resolutions? I’ve got mine. Just don’t ask me who my favourite BAME authors are yet, I might start to cry. Ask Ben Marcus instead.','https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/jan/02/new-years-reading-resolution-women-writers-classics-bame','What\'s your new year\'s reading resolution?',336,'books'),('stage/2017/jan/02/optimism-v-pessimism-2017-comedian-liam-williams-psychologist-philippa-perry-debate','One day last year, Liam Williams locked himself out and tried to climb in through his bedroom window. “I’d done it before very skilfully when drunk,” he says, “but this time I was hungover, so I guess I had that reduced inhibition, but not that derring-do – you know, the reckless optimism of a drunkard.” It didn’t end well. “It was only the first storey but I didn’t have any shoes on and it was quite a high window. I fell and broke my heels. It really hurt.” The comedian is telling this story to psychotherapist Philippa Perry and me as we meet in a London cafe to consider the merits of optimism and pessimism. Is pessimism necessarily bad for you? What health benefits come with being optimistic? Does being optimistic help you in relationships? Does being pessimistic make you pragmatic about a prospective lover’s shortcomings? If you’re as bleakly pessimistic as Eeyore, can you change? If you’re as misguidedly optimistic as Mr Micawber, can you get a firmer grip on reality? More troublingly, what looks like pessimism to one can seem like optimism to another. Consider Williams’s attempted break-in. Perry suggests that his climb was optimistic. Liam worries it was doomed by pessimism. “It comes under the heading of risk-taking,” says Perry. “Optimists are more likely to take risks – they think they can drive into that gap in traffic or climb through windows.” She pauses before adding: “That’s not necessarily a good thing.” “I was a bit desperate,” says Williams, “so I made a ridiculous decision. As I was climbing, I lacked that crucial optimism that I was going to get in. I was physically impaired and I probably had a narrative in my head that this wasn’t going to go well, which I wouldn’t have had when I was drunk.” “That,” says Perry, “is the self-fulfilling prophecy thing.” What does that mean? “If I go to a party expecting to have a good time, look people in the eye, I may well do. If I walk in hang-dog thinking nobody wants to speak to me, I probably won’t.” Viewed thus, Williams expected to fall. Perhaps he even wanted to. Soon after the fall, a friend asked Williams how he’d been feeling at the time. “I said maybe a bit depressed. And she said: ‘Maybe you took a reckless decision because you were depressed.’” Williams compares this to the EU referendum: “Maybe it was like Brexit – ‘My life is so shit at the moment that I can take this grave, reckless decision and at least something will be different.’” The year 2016 was, he thinks, marked by such pessimism. “Those who voted for Brexit and Trump were so pessimistic about how things are going, they felt any change must be better.” “Which,” adds Perry insightfully, “is quite optimistic.” Good point: to their opponents, such as Williams, Brexiteers and Trumptonians may have looked like pessimists who, in a fit of infantile petulance, were destroying their respective polities. But, seen another way, they were cock-eyed optimists who believed change was possible. Williams tells us he has turned away from standup, in part because he feared he was making his audiences as politically apathetic and pessimistic as he was. In 2014, he did a show in Edinburgh called Capitalism, which (despite the Guardian’s five-star review) made him queasy. His routine revolved around mocking his lack of political fibre: the twentysomething Cambridge English graduate didn’t have what it took to go on protests or join Occupy. Nor did he have the intellectual drive to develop a sophisticated critique of capitalism by reading Thomas Piketty or Slavoj Žižek, still less act on it. “I kept thinking: ‘There’s a lot wrong with the world, and crises are getting worse, but I can’t change any of it,” he says. Lots of people feel that way, I suggest, especially twentysomethings, and their impotence then slides into pessimism. “That’s right. But I detected in myself an apathy, a willingness to focus on trivialities,” he replies. “I wouldn’t do a show like that again, because those who saw it might walk away having let themselves off the hook.” Maybe our most evisceratingly pessimistic comedians – think Frankie Boyle or Stewart Lee – let us off the hook in the same way. Perhaps (and this is just my own pessimistic thought) comedy is a successful business model in austerity Britain because it provides alibis for inaction – and, as a result, makes things worse. So Williams has turned his back on standup. Instead, he has co-written and performs in what he calls a panto for grown-ups, called Ricky Whittington and His Cat. “He turns up in London full of optimism,” says Liam, “and finds it hostile and plagued with rats.” Still is, I point out. “Then he leaves in despair before hearing voices calling him back. He projects his inner voice on to the bells. They call him back.” Perry says this is not unusual: “He can’t own his optimism, but projects it on to the bells.” True, but on the plus side, he overcomes his pessimism, returning to London, becoming mayor and building state-of-the-art cycle lanes or whatever it was he did. So, if Williams is anything to go by, pessimism is bad for you. But it’s more complicated than that, says Perry. She hands me a list of pros and cons for both outlooks. Pros of optimism include: better mental and physical health, quicker recovery rates after illnesses and operations, lower stress, longer life, higher trust in others and thus better relationships. Pessimism’s pros include: better at budgeting, better insured, on time. Interesting: both she and Williams arrived on time, suggesting that they’re both pessimists. “Pessimists are always punctual,” says Perry. “Optimists think the bus is going to be on time, that they can get somewhere quicker than they can.” I’m hating optimists already. But surely, even if you’re an optimist, it’s better to be with a pessimist? At least they’ll be on time. And they’re better company. “Pessimists are much more cynical,” says Perry. “They see the worst in people – that’s why they’re more interesting. Though you wouldn’t want to be on a desert island with one.” Nonetheless, recent research suggests that pessimism is actually bad for you. A 2011 study, published in Stroke, a journal of the American Heart Association, measured respondents on a 16-point optimism scale and found that, for every point increase, there was a corresponding 9% decrease in acute strokes over the two-year follow-up period. But why? “Our work suggests that people who expect the best things in life actively take steps to promote health,” says Eric Kim, who has researched the subject for the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health. But this was called into question in early 2016 by Helsinki researchers who studied middle-aged Finns and found that, while pessimism was linked to an increased risk of death from coronary heart disease, there was no indication that optimism led to a decreased risk. Both studies have one thing in common: they suppose optimism and pessimism to be measurable. Levels of pessimism were measured in Helsinki by asking people to respond to such gloomy statements as: “If something can go wrong for me, it will.” Optimism, meanwhile, had such choice lines as: “In uncertain times, I usually expect the best.” None of this, you’d hope, means it’s easy to pigeonhole respondents. “Maybe labelling someone either way is as reductive as saying they’re an extrovert or introvert,” says Williams. Good point – yet scarcely a month goes by without another study telling us that optimists are healthier. Here’s another problem. What if pessimism is something you’re doomed to by genes and environment? A 2006 study suggested that outlooks are forged in childhood. Those with high socioeconomic status, unsurprisingly, were more optimistic. More interesting was the idea that pessimism tended to stick even in the face of socioeconomic fluidity. So if you had a poor, miserable childhood, you might well be pessimistic even as you bask on your parvenu yacht off Corfu. “That’s not to say you’re hard-wired to either,” says Perry. “You can change.” So we can cultivate optimism? How? Kim suggests keeping a log for a fortnight of any kind things you do for others, to achieve your “best possible self”, as well as attending mindfulness courses, getting into therapy, writing down three things each day you are grateful for. Then, at the end, you see how you feel. There is, says Perry, a neurophysiological basis to the possibility of becoming optimistic: the brain’s left inferior frontal gyrus fires up with good news; the right inferior with bad news. But if your life is marked by bad news, that left inferior is apt not to register good news. “Most people are optimists, and the more optimistic you are, the less likely the right inferior is to respond to negative information,” she says. Here’s an interesting problem with optimism. You can have too much of it. Neuroscientist Tali Sharot, author of The Optimism Bias, argues that 80% of us suffer from the illusion that supplies her book’s title. “The idea,” says Perry, “is that the optimist knows smoking kills but thinks: ‘It just won’t kill me.’” Or, as Sharot puts it: “We underestimate our likelihood of suffering from cancer, or being in a car accident. We overestimate our longevity, our career prospects. In short, we’re more optimistic than realistic, but we are oblivious to the fact.” Sounds like we should cultivate pessimism then. I’ve brought along Arthur Schopenhauer’s On the Suffering of the World, in which the German pessimist describes the nature of human life thus: “We begin in the madness of carnal desire and transport of voluptuousness, we end in the dissolution of all our parts and the musty stench of corpses … Does it not look as if existence were an error the consequences of which grow more and more manifest?” Though I place the book prominently on the cafe table, neither comedian nor psychotherapist is tempted to pick it up. “Since that fall, my life has been better,” says Williams. “I’ve pulled myself together and it made me reflect.” “So did you get another key cut?” asks Philippa. “I gave one to the neighbours,” he replies. “You’re marvellous!” she says chirpily. “That’s learning to trust people.” Williams fills his teacup – his half-empty teacup – and looks doubtful. “But there’s a degree of pessimism in that, right?” he says. “Because I know I’m going to forget the keys again.” Ricky Whittington and his Cat is at the New Diorama theatre, London, until 7 January.

But if Planet Earth was the showy, gregarious big daddy of the genre, then Life in Polar Bear Town with Gordon Buchanan (BBC2, Saturday) is its emo younger brother, more muted and contemplative, as bleak as it is enlightening. Buchanan has history with bears. He spent a year with a family of wild black bears in 2011 for The Bear Family and Me, which featured an unforgettable close encounter with a female bear unhappy that Buchanan had reached out to touch her cub. He had misjudged her acceptance of his presence; she swiped a mighty swipe to remind him. Two years later he presented The Polar Bear Family and Me, which tracked the lives of a female polar bear and her two cubs. This proved more controversial: authorities in Svalbard where it was filmed were critical of the producer’s approach and warned of a fine for “disturbing” the creatures. This makes Life In Polar Bear Town feel like something of a mea culpa. It’s the story of Churchill in northern Manitoba, Canada, which sits on the migratory path of polar bears. Towards the end of the year, the polar bears living around the town number around 1,000 to the 700 human residents. Not only have the inhabitants learned to deal with the daily reality of sharing space with one of the world’s biggest and most effective hunters; they have turned Churchill into a tourist site in which visitors can see these animals up close. It’s an uneasy mix full of contradictions that Buchanan, who is amiable to the last, gamely attempts to unpick. Our first sight of these polar bears is on a snowless expanse; the cold weather is late to arrive this year. In the background, a plane full of visitors is coming in to land. Wherever there’s a bear, there are carloads of onlookers pointing their cameras, each trying to capture their once-in-a-lifetime shot. It’s eerie and unsettling. The two worlds are not natural bedfellows. Buchanan, a spectator himself, is sympathetic. He gets that this is something people have wanted to see for their whole lives, and that the experience may make people feel more connected to the earth. But he’s clearly uneasy with the extent to which this interferes with the bears’ existence. Churchill’s conservation team has to keep their most famous residents away from the people – there hasn’t been a human killed by a bear there since 1983, though an average of 1.5 bears are “euthanised” each year. There’s “polar bear prison”, where particularly bold creatures are locked up for six weeks with no food, so as to put them off. There are deterrents in the form of sirens and flares and rubber bullets. The worst offenders are sedated and flown off in a net underneath a helicopter, to be dropped off in a safe zone 80km away. When we see it happen here, there are crowds watching, filming. The residents of Churchill have a deeper understanding of the bears, as Buchanan appears to have of the townsfolk. There’s Dennis, a lifelong resident and bear expert who suggests that perhaps a guarded fence around the town might be a better solution than locking bears away. Erin was almost scalped by a bear who grabbed her late one night, but, she points out, the bears were there first, after all. Even the cafe-owner concedes that it’s the humans causing all the issues. “We’re the problem. We’re the ones who built a town in their migratory way,” he says. Sadly, it is starting to look like a lose-lose situation. Investment in tourism is hard to come by in Churchill, they suggest, because the polar bears may not be a spectacle that can be monetised for long. They come to wait for the Arctic to freeze, so they can hunt for seals, but each year, as the climate grows milder, the sea takes longer to become ice, and thaws more quickly. If the ice goes, the bears won’t be far behind it. The truth is stark: the cars and planes bringing people to see these magnificent creatures are contributing to their extinction. This is not, then, the uplifting and cutesy entertainment you might have expected from a festive programme about polar bears. Still, at least in 2017, we can look forward to a US president who thinks global warming was invented by the Chinese, and a British prime minister who has already shut down the Department for Energy and Climate Change.

The dinner will be held in Melbourne on 10 February, with the cost of the tickets including a “sparkling welcome, a variety of fine finger food and a generous serve of free speech”. “This is an excellent opportunity to mingle with outspoken advocates for Liberty and Western values and show your support for this important cause,” the dinner advertisement says. The response to the $150 ticket price has been mixed on Facebook. One user posted “Love to come. But I live in Qld... good luck”, while another said “150 per head, bugger that!” and another posted “Sorry I am busy - I have to stay home and cut my toe nails!” Sydney will host a similar dinner on 9 February, without Christensen or Bernardi. Its speakers will include Sky News host Ross Cameron, controversial cartoonist Larry Pickering, Angry Anderson, and crime author Gabrielle Lord. The dinners will be hosted by the Q Society, which calls itself “Australia’s leading Islam-critical movement”, and has called for a 10-year moratorium on immigration from Organisation of Islamic Cooperation countries, and for Australia to withdraw from the “hijacked” UN refugee convention. Last year Mohamed El-Mouelhy, the head of Halal Certification Australia, launched legal action against the organisation and three of its members over two videos posted on YouTube in 2013 and 2014. The defendants include Kirralie Smith, a New South Wales Senate candidate for the Australian Liberty Alliance who narrated the videos, and Debbie Robinson, national president of the Q Society. According to a statement of claim filed in the action, the videos posted by the defendants made several defamatory imputations about El-Mouelhy, including that he sought to mislead and deceive the general public, was pushing for sharia law in Australia, and was promoting “a global push for Islamisation calculated to destroy Australia values of freedom and tolerance”. El-Mouelhy is seeking damages, aggravated damages, interest and injunctions against further publication of the imputations. Smith says YouTube has blocked both videos from Australian IP addresses. “So unless you have a different IP address you are not able to judge for yourself the content of these publications,” she said. Last month Christensen told Guardian Australia he had been asked to appear at the fundraising dinner in Melbourne “to assist my good friend Kirralie”. “I will be speaking in support of free speech and against political correctness.” Bernardi, who has made accusations against El-Mouelhy under parliamentary privilege, told the Australian last month he was “more than happy to ­assist in raising money to fund the legal defence of a friend against Mohamed El-Mouelhy”. Smith says all proceeds and donations will go towards the legal expenses incurred by Q Society of Australia Inc, Smith et al in the defamation action. A trial has been set down for four to five weeks in the NSW supreme court in March.','https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jan/02/cory-bernardi-and-george-christensen-to-speak-at-150-a-head-dinner-for-anti-islam-group','Cory Bernardi and George Christensen to speak at $150-a-head dinner for anti-Islam group',339,'australia-news'),('science/2017/jan/02/can-you-solve-it-new-year-new-number-new-equation','Hello guzzlers, Here in Numberland, we always knew that 2016 was going to be a bad one, since: 2016 = 666 + 666 + 666 + 6 + 6 + 6 But that’s last year’s news. What’s the story about 2017, arithmetically speaking? Well, 2017 is a prime number - the first since 2011, and the last until 2027. (Prime numbers are those numbers that are only divisible by themselves and 1.) More notably, 2017 is the smallest whole number whose cube root begins with ten distinct digits: 20171/3 = 12.63480759.... Wowza! At this time of year, many mathematically curious folk spend time looking for satisfying number patterns like this one involving the new date. (Please add your favourites in the comments below.) Just so you are not left out the fun, today’s puzzle is to fill the blanks in the following equation, so that it makes arithmetical sense: 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 = 2017 You can use any of the basic mathematical operations, +, –, x, ÷, and as many brackets as you like. So, an answer might look something like (10 + 9 + 8) x (7 – 6 – 5)/(4 + 3 + 2 + 1) = 2017, although not this one since this is incorrect. I do this ‘countdown equation’ every year. Because 2017 is prime, it is a little bit more difficult that last year’s equation where the numbers had to equal 2016. In fact, there are only 652 solutions this year, compared with 890 solutions for last year, according to my computer programmer pal Zefram. (Many of these solutions are similar). Got that? Now let’s raise the stakes. Can you do the same to this equation, which is the same as above but with the 10 deleted: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 = 2017 There are only 107 solutions to this one. Now you have a taste for this puzzle, fill in the equation with the 9 deleted too: 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 = 2017. This one only has 13 solutions. It’s interesting that each time we remove a number the solution space shrinks by a factor of about seven. We have to end there, since there are no solutions when only seven digits are left. I stipulated above that you must use only the four basic mathematical operations. But of course, if you want to show off, you can use whatever arcane or complicated mathematical operations you want. I will send a copy of my puzzle book Can You Solve My Problems? to the person who comes up with the solution to any of the three above puzzles that I consider to be the most beautiful, creative or wacky. This could be one with, say, the least number of brackets required, or with the most ambitious use of mathematical symbology. My decision is final!

I love technology, and I’m always buying the latest computers and gadgets, but I don’t consider myself an audiophile. Perhaps it’s just nostalgia, but I enjoy the warmer sound you get from old records. Occasionally, I bring out my 78 record player and listen to the crackly records of Caruso and Fritz Kreisler that my teacher Josef Gingold gave me when I was a kid. What was the first record you bought? The first recording I remember buying was a cassette tape of Jascha Heifetz playing the Wieniawski second violin concerto. I would listen to it at summer camp under my bedcovers after lights out. The first CD I bought was Mozart’s Requiem performed by Neville Marriner and the Academy of St Martin in the Fields (with Ileana Cotrubaș, Helen Watts, Robert Tear and John Shirley-Quirk). My first CD player had an alarm clock, and I set it to wake me up every day to this recording. My family thought it was a bit morbid, but I found it an inspiring way to start the morning! What was the last piece of music you bought? Last week I saw Hamilton on Broadway – the tickets were a birthday present. I was sceptical about it because of all the hype, and felt sure it must be overrated. But I was blown away by the music, the choreography, the story, and I was amazed by the originality of the production. I had to buy a CD of the cast recording. What’s your musical guilty pleasure? Genesis – my favourite rock band as a teenager. When I’m in my car, I love cranking up the volume to Supper’s Ready, or Lamb Lies Down on Broadway with Peter Gabriel. Come to think of it, why should I feel guilty about this? It’s great music! If you had time learn a new instrument, what would it be? The piano. I am still annoyed with my parents for not giving me piano lessons when I was a child. I guess because my sister played the piano they thought it was only right to let that be her thing. Did you ever consider a career outside of music? I love science, particularly physics, and I am also fascinated with molecular biology. I can imagine being some sort of scientist or medical researcher, and I’d crave something that involves discovery and invention. Luckily for me, music, in its own way, has both of those things. What single thing would improve the classical concert? I like it when there is less of a barrier between the artist and the audience. That’s why I enjoy performing or listening to chamber music in someone’s home. Performers could speak to audiences more, perhaps explain his or her unique take on the music – particularly if it’s a work the audience might not be familiar with. Presenters should keep experimenting with new ways to reach younger people – shorter concerts, “jeans concerts”, unconventional venues, etc – without diluting or dumbing down the music. If you had to pick one work to introduce someone to classical music, what would it be? Just one? There are so many pieces that would hook someone who is unfamiliar with classical music. The most obvious answer might be the best: Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony. It grabs you from the opening bar and never lets go. It may be the most popular piece of classical music ever, but the last time I directed the piece with the Academy of St Martin in the Fields, I thought afterwards that it is actually underrated. What’s the most overrated classical work? Although Ravel is one of my favourite composers, and the piece is a masterful exercise in orchestration, I could live the rest of my life without hearing the Bolero again. Which non-classical musician would you like to work with? Well, since I’m fresh off of seeing Hamilton on Broadway, I’m wondering if there is some way I could collaborate with Lin-Manuel Miranda. He is a genius. What or where is the most unusual place or venue you’ve performed? I was scheduled to play a recital in Washington DC, but a blizzard caused a power outage in the concert hall and the show was cancelled. I had been at the venue practising. I left the building, thinking that I now had the night off, and encountered about 50 people in the lobby who had made it there through two feet of snow. One lady walked for three hours only to find out the concert was cancelled. So I played for them right there in the dark, just on violin because there was no piano in the lobby. It was my most appreciative audience ever. We’re giving you a time machine: which period or moment in musical history would you travel to and why? My first idea would be to travel to ancient Rome. We know that they had music then, but what exactly did it sound like? Today we can only speculate. Or, if I had to choose a particular day, perhaps I would travel to 22 December 1808. I would get to hear, in a single concert, the premieres of Beethoven’s Fifth and Sixth Symphonies with the composer himself conducting. (Did he really follow his metronome markings?) As a bonus, I would get to hear a solo improvisation by Beethoven and also witness him play his Fourth Piano Concerto – my favourite – in its first public performance. Apparently, many in attendance that night did think that the four-hour concert was too long, but I wouldn’t mind. Joshua Bell is music director of Academy of St Martin in the Fields. He performs and directs Mendelssohn’s Violin Concerto in E Minor with the ASMF on 19 January at Cadogan Hall, London.','https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/02/facing-the-music-violinist-joshua-bell-academy-of-st-martin-in-the-fields-interview','Facing the music: Joshua Bell',341,'music'),('artanddesign/2017/jan/02/va-returns-tudor-bedroom-to-original-sizergh-castle-setting','More than 120 years after London’s V&amp;A museum paid a small fortune to acquire one of the grandest bedrooms of Tudor England, it has been formally transferred to its original home, Cumbria’s Sizergh Castle, now in the care of the National Trust. “We’re delighted. We know it’s in safe hands and will be enjoyed by so many people back in its proper context,” said Nick Humphrey, a curator and Tudor furniture specialist at the V&amp;A. The museum paid £1,000 for the room in 1891, followed five years later by another £400 for its towering bed and heraldic stained glass windows. The castle dates back to the 14th century but was fashionably remodelled in the 16th century by Walter Strickland, who began work on the spectacular second-floor bedroom. Still unfinished when he died in 1569, the room was completed by his widow Alice Tempest and her third husband. It was panelled in oak inlaid with creamy white poplar wood and black bog oak, under an ornate plaster ceiling. It also had a porch to protect the occupants from draughts from the stone spiral stairs outside. By the late 19th century, however, when many of the great houses of England were importing American heiresses to balance their books or selling their treasures in the other direction to US collectors, the Stricklands had fallen on hard times. George Howard, the ninth earl of Carlisle, was roped in to make discreet approaches to the V&amp;A. The house was “in a rather ruinous state”, he wrote, and the owner wanted to sell his best bedroom. “This you must really have. It is the best thing of the kind I have seen … dealers have already been at him.” After some haggling the enormous price was agreed. Humphrey, who has been poring over the correspondence, says that the museum was more interested in continental interiors at the time. The panelled room from Bromley-by-Bow, now on display in the British galleries, cost only £225 in 1894, and in 1899 the museum paid £375 for 100 carved wooden panels from Waltham Abbey. “In 1890 and 1891 any purchase more than £100 was rare, with the majority of acquisitions less than £15,” he said. The entire Sizergh room was stripped out, leaving only the original ceiling – which was copied in South Kensington from a cast – and the fireplace, which had been heavily altered in the 18th century. The windows and the bed, which had also been altered, followed in 1896. The earliest letter Humphrey can trace from the family saying that they would like their room back came in 1949. When the house was transferred the following year to the National Trust, it promptly asked the museum too. The response from the V&amp;A has echoes of the bitter controversy involving the British Museum and the Parthenon marbles. The trustees concluded that they would not be able to dispose of the collection legally, they were unsure how secure it would be in Cumbria, it would open a floodgate of requests for other returns … and they were not convinced the National Trust would last. There was much the same response in 1991, when the architectural historian Marc Girouard, an expert on English country houses, wrote in Country Life that the room should go back. Humphrey says the real change of heart came as the V&amp;A prepared to open the new British galleries in 2001. With the display of complete rooms being reduced, the prospect was of only showing pieces of the bedroom panelling, with most of it going into store. Instead the whole room went back to Sizergh on long loan, to be reinstated under its original ceiling. A historic legal agreement has now been signed to formally transfer ownership of the room to the National Trust. Georgina Gates, the collections manager at the castle, said it was “without doubt the jewel in Sizergh’s crown”. Humphrey said: “We now know the National Trust isn’t going away any time soon. The room is back in the right place.”','https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jan/02/va-returns-tudor-bedroom-to-original-sizergh-castle-setting','V&A returns Tudor bedroom to original Sizergh Castle setting',342,'artanddesign'),('uk-news/2017/jan/02/glasgow-childrens-wood-saved-from-development','North Kelvin Meadow – or Children’s Wood, as it has been renamed by campaigners – has been saved from housing developers after a hard-fought five year battle, some two decades on from when locals first sowed grass seed on the abandoned sports ground. In contrast to the city’s nearby Botanic Gardens, the three acre Children’s Wood is a ramshackle affair, offering a very different kind of natural resource to local residents who have gradually transformed the meadow from a derelict site into a thriving civic space, close to the fashionable West End. Having been declared “surplus” in the mid-1990s, there have since been a number of attempts to develop the area, most recently the plans first proposed by developers New City Vision in 2011 to build ninety upmarket flats on the site. After a lengthy dispute, which saw cash-strapped Glasgow city council arguing that a negative outcome would deprive it of funds to deliver crucial facilities across the city, the decision was referred up to an independent ‘reporter’, and then to the Scottish government itself, whose decision last month emphasised the importance of open space and biodiversity in the heart of the city. Now campaigners hope this outcome could set a precedent for other areas and help mould policy around land and community empowerment. Children’s Wood campaigners now plan to ask the council to lease or sell them the land, pursuing their community right to buy ‘abandoned or neglected land’ that was created in 2015 under one of Scotland’s most potentially progressive pieces of legislation in recent times. “What we need is a fundamental shift in understanding that green space within cities is important,” says Emily Cutts, a researcher who has been involved with the campaign since its inception. “The fact that the government rejected these plans is great, and we hope it may result in a change in planning policy, so that other communities don’t have to go to a public inquiry, or have independent reporters involved.” While Scotland has seen a groundswell of local activism around land use in recent years, it has mainly revolved around rural settings – like the £500,000 community buyout of an ancient Caledonian pine forest in the Highlands announced in December. Cutts hopes this success will motivate people in urban areas, adding simply: “Councils still don’t value green space over housing”. Children’s Wood has attracted a cross-section of community support, but Cutts is aware of accusations that the campaign has been dominated by middle class residents able to corral the support of the likes of children’s author Julia Donaldson, comedian Frankie Boyle and Game of Thrones actress Kate Dickie. In response that this charge, Cutts said: “It’s about meeting 21st century needs, and its not nimbyist. We’re always looking at the bigger picture, and specific problems in the area. For example, with food poverty, we’re growing vegetables for an outdoor food bank.” The wood has also been used in projects that have targeted obesity in young people, loneliness in older residents, and most recently provided refugee newcomers to Glasgow a different means of learning about the city. Children’s Wood has even offered itself as a research resource, linking up with Glasgow University’s psychology department on a project that compared children’s attention spans after spending time in a variety of locations: the conclusion was that concentration was best after spending time in a natural environment. Outdoor education has been a huge part of the Children’s Wood ethos, based on the principle that urban children should not require money to have access to nature. “Five years ago, we really wanted to build something for the whole community: now we have relationships with 20 schools, both in the West End and Maryhill, and two employees working on outdoor learning,” Cutts said. Declaring himself “thrilled” at the decision, Scottish Greens co-convenor and MSP for Glasgow Patrick Harvie, a long-standing supporter of the North Kelvin meadow campaign, sounded a word of warning around community buy-outs more generally. “Transferring a piece of land into community ownership is in many ways positive but it shouldn’t be necessary. We obviously need housing investment, but the point is to be building for a social purpose, not speculative investment. There are plenty of brownfield sites in Glasgow that developers don’t look at with eager eyes because they aren’t as profitable. When the community is making good use of land like this they should be left alone,” he said. With a newly expanded cohort of Green MSPs in Holyrood since May’s elections – including veteran land reform campaigner Andy Wightman – there have been high hopes for them pushing the Scottish government towards some truly transformative reform of land and planning legislation. Current Scottish land reform legislation, which has been criticised for its timidity, had its final passage in March, just before the Scottish parliament elections. During the vote, a ground-breaking Green amendment to tax vacant and derelict land was voted down, despite research indicating it would have raised £250m a year and forced developers to make better use of the land they had.','https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/02/glasgow-childrens-wood-saved-from-development','Glasgow Children\'s Wood saved from development',343,'uk-news'),('books/2017/jan/02/the-case-against-sugar-gary-taubes-review-compelling-attack-diet-myths','For the last 15 years, US journalist Gary Taubes has been the self-nominated public enemy No 1 of the global “healthy eating” establishment. His heresy has been to argue powerfully and publicly that the official diet advice we have been encouraged to follow since the 1970s is fundamentally wrong. It is refined carbohydrates and sugars that we should be avoiding, he says, not fat. His apostasy was dismissed by many health professionals in a sustained, near operatic chorus of censure. After all, he had committed the cardinal crime of suggesting that august government nutrition professors and the academic researchers who inform them had made an inexcusable error of judgment, with catastrophic consequences: an epidemic of obesity and diet-related ill-health of a magnitude that had no precedent. Taubes’s latest book, The Case Against Sugar, looks to be less controversial, if only because so-called guardians of public health have of late subtly re-emphasised in government eating guidelines the role of sugar as a dietary villain, adopting what Taubes calls the “we knew it all along” approach. They have yet to admit that the natural saturated fats they have long demonised, such as butter, are healthier than the highly refined liquid oils and polyunsaturated margarine spreads they continue to recommend, even though the scientific inadequacy of this advice is being steadily exposed. In Taubes’s view, major nutrition authorities “have spent the last 50 years blaming dietary fat for our ills while letting sugar off the hook”. But Taubes is like a terrier with a bone. He won’t let purveyors of this bankrupt diet paradigm get away with a bit of pragmatic sugar reduction tokenism. In order to firmly hammer the nails in the coffin of the case against sugar, he sets out to nail the lie on which it is predicated: that the tidal wave of obesity and type 2 diabetes sweeping the western world is caused by overconsumption and sedentary behaviour. This contention currently forms the bedrock of official nutrition advice worldwide. “The fundamental cause of obesity and [being] overweight is an energy imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended,” is how the World Health Organisation puts it. Custodians of public health have prescribed this “eat less/move more” doctrine for decades, to embarrassingly little effect. Taubes shows how this “energy balance” explanation of swollen waistlines draws its apparent intellectual credibility from a myth that suits the processed food industry: “There’s no bad food, only bad diets.” Using this “balanced” diet argument, big food can persuade us that we can stay healthy while eating junk daily. This is the warped thinking that allows&nbsp;hospital shops to stock up with fizzy drinks and assorted sweet, starchy rubbish and heap patients’ meal trays with jelly and custard. Government diet advisers can be relied upon to faithfully promote the “everything in moderation” and “a calorie is a calorie” parables, so aiding and abetting food and drink companies’ use of sugar to lend false palatability to their nutritionally degraded products. Taubes, however, argues that sugars are bad in and of themselves, that they have “a unique physiological, metabolic and endocrinological (hormonal) effect on our bodies”. Sugars are what an evolutionary biologist might call the environmental or dietary switch that triggers a genetic predisposition to obesity and turn an otherwise healthy diet into a harmful one. They are, says Taubes, the most likely triggers of “insulin resistance”, the condition that leads to obesity, diabetes and a number of other diseases, from gout and varicose veins to irritable bowel syndrome and asthma. “Once this process starts, easily digestible, carbohydrate-rich foods aid and abet it.” For Taubes, sugar is at the root of all “the diseases of westernisation”, including cancer, even Alzheimer’s disease, which researchers now increasingly refer to as “type 3 diabetes”. “Put simply,” he writes “without these sugars in our diets, the cluster of related illnesses would be far less common than it is today.” Like many US books of its type – Nina Teicholz’s Big Fat Surprise is another – there’s a high level of detail in this volume as Taubes unpicks the history of the ubiquitous dogmas dominating diet thinking today that may send the less committed reader looking for an executive summary. But&nbsp;this density and thoroughness befits the scale of the task such authors face: nothing more or less than reversing an entrenched diet orthodoxy in which powerful professional reputations and corporate interests are heavily invested. Taubes isn’t the only person to challenge the facile idea that we get fat simply because we consume more calories than we expend, but his clear and persuasive argument that obesity is a hormonal disorder, switched on by sugar, is one that urgently needs wider airing. Then we can decide for ourselves whether obesity is really caused by “a perverted appetite” that leads many of us to overeat or by the food processors’ pathological appetite for profit. •&nbsp;The Case Against Sugar by Gary Taubes is published by Portobello Books (£14.99).

There they were plunged into hell. Nick Braley, Richie Greaves, Tim Knowles and Adrian Tempany are all survivors of the horrific crush in pen 3 of Hillsborough’s Leppings Lane terrace, which killed 96 people and injured hundreds more. On 26 April 2016, the four were at the converted court in Warrington for verdicts they never really believed would come: the jury at the new inquests determined that the 96 people who died were unlawfully killed, due to South Yorkshire police failings and the criminal gross negligence of the officer in command, Ch Supt David Duckenfield. The jury rejected the lurid testimony from South Yorkshire police officers, who had accused Liverpool fans of having caused the deaths themselves, alleging they were drunk, late and uncooperative. This time, unlike the first inquest in 1991, the victims and survivors, many of them friends and family of the people who died, were finally exonerated completely. But the euphoria of the verdicts, and contemplation of a new year free of false blame for the first time, have not dimmed the anger survivors still feel towards the police. The IPCC is expected to send files to the Crown Prosecution Service early this year in relation to possible manslaughter and other offences for the 96 deaths, and potential perjury and perverting the course of justice by South Yorkshire police officers in the alleged cover-up that followed. For the survivors, the worry before the 26 April inquest verdicts had been intense, after the police had sought to blame supporters again, and the coroner, Sir John Goldring, had given the evidence sufficient credence to put it to the jury. “To be labelled a murderer of our own fellow fans, which is how I felt we were, was disgusting,” reflected Braley, who was a 19-year-old student at the time. “We have lived with that all our adult lives; we were the accused. If the jury had believed the police lies, that mud would have stuck to us.” “It was very, very stressful,” said Greaves. “It reached the point where my wife said she wanted me back; she felt she’d lost me.” Greaves, 23 in 1989, who now runs a courier company in his native Heswall, said the verdicts lifted a weight of 27 years. “I couldn’t even bear hearing the word Hillsborough. The verdicts brought a massive relief and sense of vindication; I feel more confident as a person now. Not to have that burden, that accusation that we were the cause of people dying.” Braley, Greaves, Knowles, Tempany and many others have as adults insistently borne witness to the truth of what happened, and applied their professional skills to campaigning against the police’s lies. Tempany, who was 19 in 1989, has written an acclaimed book, And the Sun Shines Now, about Hillsborough and English football’s subsequent commercialisation. His account is searing, telling of the horror he endured, trapped as people died around him, and how his trauma was deepened due to the police blaming the victims. “I know one survivor who killed himself, two others who tried,” he said. “People were on the edge before the verdicts and if it had gone wrong, they would have been distraught.” After the indomitable justice campaign which led in 2012 to the Hillsborough Independent Panel’s report comprehensively overturning the police narrative, and the high court quashing of the first inquest, the survivors were shocked to learn late in 2015 that Goldring was putting to the jury the question about whether supporters should be blamed. The lord chief justice, Igor Judge, when he quashed the first inquest, had dismissed the police story as a “falsity”, and warned that he would “deprecate” the new inquests turning into an “adversarial battle” like the first. However, neither he nor Goldring actually had the authority to enforce that in new proceedings, and the police chose to rerun the old allegations aggressively. Then, Goldring framed the question for the jury very widely, asking if there was “any of the behaviour of football supporters which caused or contributed to the dangerous situation at the Leppings Lane turnstiles” – or which “may have caused or contributed” to it. Knowles was 17 at Hillsborough, one of 10 young men there who were friends growing up in Formby. Three of their group died: Gary Church, then 19, Simon Bell, 17, and Christopher Devonside, 18. Knowles was particularly close to Devonside and his family; they were studying the same A levels, both wanted to be journalists. Knowles grew up to fulfil that ambition, despite his trauma, making a career in journalism, including working for the Guardian. Of the question put to the jury, he is still exasperated: “The police case was always to deny their failings and claim that we killed our friends. Here the coroner was inviting the jury to find that, even that we ‘may have’. So it was a realistic prospect that after everything we had been through to overturn the lies, these new inquests could see that officially established. And we would have been labelled with that all our lives.” They were also outraged that Goldring was proposing “football supporters” could be blamed, without any actual people having to be identified for any specific alleged misconduct – and with none of those accused legally represented. Deeply alarmed, in January, Braley, Greaves and Knowles applied to Goldring for “interested party” status, to be represented. They were substantially helped by Tempany, campaigner Jim Sharman, and Chris Lightbown, a former Sunday Times journalist who, after the disaster, remained close to some of the bereaved families. “I still feel very angry,” said Knowles, “that Goldring was allowing ‘football supporters’ to be blamed, but they were a nameless mob again, nobody identified and given the right to be represented. This was continuing how the false case was made in the first place, by dehumanising football supporters.” Goldring turned down their application. He stated via the inquest’s solicitor that the three survivors had no right to be represented, because there had been no accusation made against them personally. He argued it was a “fallacy” to believe that all supporters were being potentially blamed, when the question was about “only some” of them. Their solicitor, Lochlinn Parker, replied that it was “plainly correct” that all survivors were included in the question, because not a single individual had been identified, so it was being asked about everybody who had been at the Leppings Lane end. Goldring said the survivors’ case, challenging the police, had been argued at the inquests anyway because some of the bereaved families, who were legally represented, included relatives who had been at the match with those who died. So none of the survivors who applied, nor “football supporters” as a group, were to be represented and allowed to defend their good names. Tempany has repeatedly emphasised the devastating impact a finding of culpability would have had on survivors. He wrote in his book that some, traumatised already for years, would have killed themselves. Before the verdicts, the group suggested to the inquests’ organisers that medical and mental health professionals should be on hand but that request was turned down, too. Then, on another sunny day in April, the inquests’ jury revealed that they had seen through the police case. To the question about “football supporters” causing or contributing to the dangerous situation, they answered, simply and definitively: “No.” Tempany recalled that they felt euphoric, that “poison had been drained from us, a weight lifted off”. But Braley said he still felt great anger at the ordeal they were forced to go through, the “unbelievable stress” before the verdicts, and it took time for him to savour the feeling of exoneration. They are looking ahead to the first year of their adult lives relieved of their burden, but as the Independent Police Complaints Commission concludes its mammoth investigation into possible criminal offences leading to the 96 deaths, and the alleged police cover-up, they do want prosecutions. “You cannot be responsible for the deaths of 96 people, and instead label innocent victims as being guilty, have police officers telling such lies, without being held to account,” Braley said. “We have the truth established, finally. Now we want justice to be done.”','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/02/hillsborough-disaster-survivors-seek-justice-for-alleged-police-cover-up','Hillsborough disaster: survivors seek justice for alleged police cover-up',345,'football'),('travel/2017/jan/02/yoga-mindfulness-norfolk-retreat-weekend','We’re all tired. Some of us go on about it more than others (guilty) but most of us are wrecked most of the time. Which is why going on holiday to lie down in a darkened room for two days is not as weird as it might once have sounded. That’s essentially what Satvada Retreats offers on its winter weekends in north Norfolk: two days of mindfulness and yoga in the beautiful setting of West Lexham, a cluster of converted, eco-friendy farm buildings and treehouses (plus bell tents in summer) set in extensive grounds with paths winding through gardens and around a lake. Mindfulness may be all the rage but I’d never tried it and was concerned that it would mean sitting awkwardly on a hard floor being told how to breathe. The first session with Lucia Cockcroft, who runs Satvada and is a trained mindfulness instructor, put my mind at rest – literally. After spending 10 minutes getting comfy on our mats with the help of various bolsters and cushions and Lucia asking hypnotically whether we could be “5 or 10% more relaxed”, I was already feeling sleepy. Then we were asked to focus on the sensation of our breath on our nostrils. And that was it. Forty-five minutes later I was in a semi-comatose state, lulled by my own breathing and calmed by Lucia’s gentle assurances not to worry if I lost concentration. As well as mindfulness sessions, another teacher, Vikki Stevenson, led us through yoga nidra – or yogic sleep. In 10 years of going to yoga classes I’ve deliberately avoided the boring, I mean slow, classes in favour of ashtanga, a fast, dynamic form of practice that leaves you feeling like you’ve had a proper workout and has the added benefit of not allowing time to think about anything other than the next pose. Yoga nidra is at the opposite end of the scale: a series of gentle movements aimed at inducing a state of “conscious sleep”. Instead of pushing your body, you’re calming it. Guided by Vikki, in a voice that was part nursery school teacher, part hypnotist, exercises like “the scan”, where you focus on different parts of your body from the crown of your head to the tops on your toes, left me poleaxed, and a convert to more restorative forms of yoga. Between sessions I roused myself enough to read – lying down on the sofa, of course – or go for gentle walks. The barn where we ate and did classes was more than spacious enough for our group of 10, with underfloor heating and two wood burners making it feel positively tropical in December. By contrast, outside looked like a Christmas card, the fields and trees coated in sparkling white frost, the sky streaked with pink and gold. We couldn’t have asked for a prettier setting for our silent walk. On Saturday, Lucia announced – to my slight alarm – that there would be a period of silence from 9.30pm that night until lunchtime the next day. And so, on Sunday morning, off we trooped along country lanes and across fields to Castle Acre, studiously ignoring each other and focusing instead on our surroundings: I took a lot of close-ups of frosty leaves on my mobile (not entirely in the spirit of the weekend as we’d been invited to switch our phones off but in my defence I was appreciating the little things). Silence can be awkward, especially with people you don’t know well, but after my initial and very British “this is weird” reaction, I found it calming. The hum of modern life is one of the reasons we’re all tired. Turning off the noise is a rare treat. With no pressure to make small talk, we settled into our own little worlds, much to the bemusement of the delivery man who arrived at the barn with a package only to be faced with a room full of middle-aged women ignoring each other. There were other eye-rolling moments during the weekend, like the conversation – over quinoa porridge, natch – about the merits of buckwheat pillows (consensus – they’re good); or the chorus of “Is it vegan? Is it dairy-free? Is it gluten-free?” at dinner on the first night. No worries on that score – all meals were vegan, plentiful and delicious: “lasagne” made with layers of butternut squash, homemade soups for lunch, a sticky toffee pudding with coconut ice cream. So don’t let talk of tofu and buckwheat put you off. If beating tiredness was as simple as having a rest, we wouldn’t be in the midst of an exhaustion epidemic. Lucia’s retreats allow you to take more drastic action to calm the body and mind: a full-scale withdrawal from real life, or as one book I picked up put it: “turn on your dimmer switch.” It worked for me. On Saturday I felt wiped out but after a day of alternating mindful/nidra classes I slept for 10 hours and woke up to an unfamiliar sensation. It took me a moment or two to put my finger on it: I wasn’t tired. Not only was I not tired, I felt so energetic I considered going for a run, something I haven’t done for five years. Of course it’s easy to relax when you have nothing to do but breathe deeply. What happens when you have to return to the real world? The weekends are designed to equip you with some basic tools to introduce moments of relaxation to your own life: exercises but also the realisation that you don’t have to be a Buddhist monk to be mindful. Anyone can do it. In every session, Lucia and Vikki reiterated the mantra of not criticising or judging yourself – if your mind wanders, don’t worry about it. In other words, cut yourself some slack. And breathe… • Three nights from £399 for a shared room including all sessions and meals. The next retreat is 20 January 2017, satvada-retreats.co.uk.

The image of three-year-old Alan Kurdi laying facedown and lifeless on a beach near the Turkish resort of Bodrum in September 2015 sparked a wave of outrage across the world. For Rob Lawrie, a self-employed carpet cleaner from Guiseley near Leeds, it changed everything. Weeks after seeing the images, Lawrie, 50, was arrested by French police at the Calais border. Officers discovered a four-year-old Afghan girl, Bahar Ahmadi, in a compartment above the driver’s seat of his van. Lawrie had been volunteering in Calais refugee camp and in a moment he describes as “irrational, irrational, irrational”, he gave in to her father’s desperate pleas to bring his daughter to Britain where she would live with their relatives in Leeds. Last January, a French court spared Lawrie jail for what he calls his “crime of compassion”. He became an overnight cause célèbre, winning thousands of supporters online and raising donations for child refugees. A Hollywood producer is writing a feature film titled Mr Rob, the name given to him in Calais, and he continues to take charity donations to displaced children across Europe. It has, however, come at a price:. His marriage has broken down and he says he was at risk of losing his home in West Yorkshire but for an “extremely understanding” landlord. How does he look back on 2016? “I don’t know whether I want to reflect on it so I’ve just kept going really,” he says. “Kept going to Calais, kept going to Paris. I’ve just got back from Greece. “It’s changed everything for me,” he says with a pause. “I still have my family. I still have my children. Talk about a life being changed in a year. This time a year ago I was a happy family man. And I was going to stop, but when it all broke down I just carried on and got deeper and deeper into it.” Last month Lawrie took a van full of donations to Thessaloniki, where thousands of refugees are said to be living in dire conditions. He took a rusty woodburner donated by a stranger with him. “You would’ve thought it was made out of gold,” he said. “I’ll tell you why I do this, because it doesn’t pay any money whatsoever. For the first half of my life I was like most people, working to live. Earn money, earn money, have a nicer car, have a bigger house, have two holidays instead of one, buy an Armani suit instead of a Next suit. But getting nothing out of it. You get so much out of this personally.” A former soldier in the Royal Corps of Transport, Lawrie served in Bosnia and Northern Ireland before leaving to attend university. After that he set up a successful courier business in the north-east of England. In 2003, however, he contracted bacterial meningitis. When he was eventually released from hospital, he says his dramatic mood swings caused the breakup of his first marriage. From erratic highs – buying holidays to California, or a new Range Rover – he would plummet to despairing lows. One day, he says, he bought a high-powered Honda Hornet motorbike and wrote it off the same day, landing himself back in hospital. He was eventually diagnosed with bipolar disorder. “On the back of that I’d be wanting to drop myself from a tree,” he says. Lawrie reached a nadir shortly after recovering from meningitis, he says, when he was made homeless and slept rough in the changing rooms of a disused swimming pool in Otley. “That was where I lived for three months,” he says. Now, he has a purpose. “When you think about it, I’ve probably got 30 years left on this planet. I can do nothing about the past, but I can try to accept everything about the now and change things for the future by doing positive things now,” he says. “You’ve heard all these cliches before, but I believe in them, you know. If I can change one or maybe five people’s lives for the better then that’ll do me. And if everyone thought like that ... ” Not everyone has praised Lawrie as a hero. He says he has received abuse from “local keyboard warriors” and a message online that he “should be hung for trying to smuggle in a future suicide bomber”. The rise of the far right across Europe has led to the sort of vitriol that preceded the second world war, he says. Equally, the ongoing refugee crisis has inspired ordinary people to do extraordinary things. A woman contacted Lawrie recently, he says, and sent him £2,000 to hire a van to take aid to Greece. Her husband had cancer and she could not leave the house, but she wanted to do something to help. Lawrie is furious at the British government, which took about 750 refugee children from Calais before halting the process last month. “As far as child refugees are concerned it’s just atrocious,” he says. “It makes me ashamed to be English.” Lawrie remains in touch with Bahar, or Bru as he calls her, and her father Reza, whom he says are safe and being looked after in France. A year on from his decision to smuggle the toddler out of Calais, would he do it again? “I’d never do that again, no,” he said, nodding his head with a grin, before adding: “Well, you know, would I get a child to safety if I could get away with it? Yeah, I would.”','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/02/man-who-tried-to-smuggle-child-refugee-into-uk-id-never-do-it-again-well-','Man who tried to smuggle child refugee into UK: \'I\'d never do it again. Well ... \'',347,'world'),('commentisfree/2017/jan/02/self-improvement-optimization','On 1 January last year we began a new research project called “Optimised”. We had published a book called The Wellness Syndrome the year before, questioning the growing pressure to become fitter, smarter and more productive. While sympathising with the desire for self-improvement, we were concerned with the punishing ideals of this culture. People were starting to act as if they were their own tyrannical boss, imposing on themselves demands to be more streamlined and efficient. BF Skinner’s theory of behaviour modification had made a surprising return in the form of smartphone apps urging us to self-administer rewards and punishment, and there was also a sudden impulse to track our lives, pedantically monitoring our sleep and exercise with wearable technologies. These seemed much like the technologies used to track prisoners, but wrapped around our wrists instead of our ankles. One wristband even sent out electric shocks, as though wearers were conducting the Milgram experiment – designed to test obeying instructions which caused pain – on themselves. When readers of The Wellness Syndrome had asked about our personal engagement with self-improvement, we had to admit it was close to nonexistent. Sceptical for as long as we could remember, our preferred way to engage with this culture had been from a safe analytical distance. But we decided to optimise one aspect of our lives each month for a year, submitting ourselves to the advice of experts and using the latest self-improvement technologies and life hacks. We browsed thousands of books, magazines and podcasts to devise our list of subjects. Some, such as productivity, were so popular that they seemed unavoidable – and we included body, brain, relationships, money, enjoyment, spirituality and attention too. Goodness appeared to be a new area of optimisation – not least with the recent popularity of effective altruists, who aim to achieve the most good in the most efficient way possible. Finally, there was sex. Neither of us were particularly keen on “optimising” this area of our lives, but if we wanted an impartial selection, there was no way of avoiding it. We began with productivity, meeting experts who helped us optimise our work routines. We also ingested smart drugs, used by one in four students at Oxford University. Obviously this is not advisable, but André nonetheless liked the drugs and went on a 40-hour work marathon, keeping himself awake with the help of modafinil, a narcolepsy drug, and finishing a book he’d been writing. Carl became anxious and fidgety on the same drug, but found ADHD medication such as metamina and attentin more helpful. To monitor our sleep, nutrition and movements, we used apps and the wearable technology Fitbit (20 million Fitbits were sold in 2015 alone). By the end of the month we had achieved our goals of writing a book each, and were pleased with them (both will be published later this year). But we also realised we had done almost nothing but work. The next area was the body. André joined the 50 million Europeans who run regularly, and began training for an ultramarathon, contributing to the multibillion-dollar running market in Europe by buying expensive running equipment. Like 2 million others, he also registered for a weekly Parkrun. Carl became one of the 47 million European gym members. At the start of the month he weighed 77.6kg (12 stone 3lb), but after weeks of intense sessions with personal trainers and a daily 5,000-calorie diet, made up of proteins and sports supplements (sports nutrition is now a $5.9bn market in the US alone), he gained 6kg (13lb). During the last days of the month, he participated in a professional weight-lifting competition and finished last. In March we optimised our brains. Carl was mastering memorisation techniques, learning the names and order of the US presidents, Swedish prime ministers, and all the capitals of the world – and doing what 50 million people had done before him by downloading cognitive enhancement apps. He tried and failed to become one of the 110,000 members of Mensa by taking an IQ test – scoring 114, almost 20 points short of the entry requirement. But he was more successful in learning to solve one of the 350m Rubik’s cubes which have been sold over the years, and by the end of the month he could also recite the first 1,000 digits of pi. André, meanwhile, tried to learn programming. In an attempt to improve his chances, he went to see a brain hacker, who administered Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation – an increasingly popular technology for improving learning, used by the US military, in which a magnet is used to stimulate areas of the brain. Despite these efforts, André failed to learn how to programme. In the manner of serious self-optimisers, we had set ourselves clear goals for each month, and in the event of failing, we handed out punishments to each other. On failing to learn programming, André had to give a talk on the subject “Why I am an asshole” at Speakers’ Corner in London. Spending only a month on each area may sound like too short a time, but by the end of each month we were exhausted, and unsurprisingly some months were more challenging than others (we almost stopped the project on three occasions). While André was struggling to learn programming, Carl was having a difficult time test-driving sex toys – a prostate vibrator and a transparent fleshlight – confronting his own barriers of shame. The most positive experience for Carl was July, the month we dedicated to pleasure, when he started smoking again after six years without nicotine. But after 10 days of enjoyment, it was an ordeal to quit again. For Andre, the most rewarding period was in October, when we were trying to be good, and he lived for a while according to Greek philosophy, spending his days in a deckchair, relaxing outside the Bank of England and reflecting on the meaning of life. As the project progressed, we found it more natural to challenge our everyday routines, testing techniques and ideas we would otherwise have found pointless, if not outright absurd (many more approaches than detailed here). At the end of the year, for instance, when we were trying to optimise the attention people paid us, Carl uploaded his photo to the website Reddit, where visitors could rate his appearance. After receiving criticism, he had cosmetic surgery to enhance his jawline. As the year drew to an end, we were asked if our optimisations had been successful. This seems like the wrong question. There has been some success, sure, but often tainted with failure. Carl learned French in one month, in April, but the experience of appearing on French radio was so traumatising that he has since been incapable of reading or speaking a word of the language. André successfully completed an ultramarathon but lost money in September, when he became a day trader, joining the 92,000 active users of spread-betting platforms. We’ve also been asked what we will continue to do now this year is over. When answering this, we have found ourselves listing useful discoveries, such as the Pomodoro time-management technique, where you work intensively for 25 minutes followed by a five-minute break. Simple as it is, this technique worked magic for us. But handing out advice puts us in danger of playing the role of self-help experts, betraying the basic motivation for our study – to produce a close-up diagnosis of optimisation culture. One crucial insight has emerged though. To immerse yourself in self-help culture, and expect to resurface in a sober, reflective state, is very much easier said than done. We’re interested from hearing from readers about their experiences of self-optimisation, as people embark on another round of resolutions. Why are we trying so hard to optimise ourselves? How can we explain the rise of this billion-dollar industry? What does it actually take to change ourselves, and to win approval from others? Is this something we do because we really want to? Or is it something we feel compelled to engage in, as though it was compulsory? Carl Cederström and André Spicer will joined us this morning to discuss all these questions, you can see their comments below.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/02/self-improvement-optimization','We dedicated a year to self-improvement: here’s what it taught us | Carl Cederström and André Spicer',348,'commentisfree'),('money/2017/jan/02/whirlpool-hotpoint-safety-recall-tumble-dryer-parking-charge','Having read your articles about the potential fire risk of Whirlpool tumble dryers, I contacted the firm to see if my Hotpoint machine was part of the recall. I had been told previously it was not, but decided to double-check. It said it had made a mistake and that it did require a fix – in itself not impressive. When I booked an engineer, however, I was told I would have to cover the parking costs at my flat, which I think adds insult to injury. It’s not a huge amount but I objected on principle. This is appalling customer service and may put off people from organising an essential modification for a potentially serious fire risk. Also, why should I have to pay for something that is a fault in Hotpoint’s manufacturing process? I would have thought Whirlpool would be trying to repair its reputation rather than passing on costs to customers.

If you are chained to your desk for hours on end, it is important to shoehorn in a bit of exercise. Cycling to work, getting off the tube or bus a stop earlier, taking the stairs, visiting colleagues in different parts of the office rather than emailing, are some of the many ways to do this, says Dr John Giles, an NHS consultant radiologist and medical director at Benenden. “Just half an hour of exercise a day can make a huge difference,” he says. Take your lunch break It is too easy to skip your lunch break and shovel in a sandwich while staring a computer screen. But taking time out in the middle of the working day is another way to cram in some exercise, even if it’s a short burst. “Just getting up and going for a walk after lunch is a brilliant idea as it helps to normalise blood sugar levels quicker so there’s no post-lunch slump,” says Jo Blood, managing director of Posture People, a commercial furniture consultancy. Another way to make your lunch break more active is to exercise with a group of coworkers, says Julia Scodie, founder of Exercise in the City, a fitness group which runs office-based exercise classes. “You don’t need too much room, just move desks and chairs aside in a meeting room. Speak to your HR department about setting something up,” she says. If space is an issue, perhaps organise a group run or walk, she suggests. Avoid neck and eye strain As work becomes more sedentary we are spending more hours at a computer screen, which can cause eye strain and headaches. It is important, therefore, to take regular eye breaks. The 20:20:20 rule, where every 20 minutes you stare at something 20ft away for 20 seconds, helps. Set a timer or use an app such as Eyecare to prompt you. To reduce eye and neck strain, adjust your seat height so your eyes line up with the top on the computer screen, says Blood. Consider the lighting. “Try experimenting with a lamp by your desk, or a different colour tint on the screen might help,” she says. Apps such as ScreenRule and f.lux change the colour of the screen to reduce straining blue light. Walking around the office has an additional benefit, says Scodie. “Where you can, try to speak to colleagues face to face or call clients rather than sending emails. This can really help to reduce screen time.” Dealing with stress at work Workplace stress is a growing problem. As well as affecting the mental health of employees it can manifest itself physically, whether that’s back and neck pain, stomach aches or headaches. In stressful situations the fight or flight response can be activated, says Justin Eade, an active workplace consultant and digital health innovator at Glimpse, a gesture technology company. “When we experience this at less appropriate times it can be very distressing and upsetting,” he says. Maintaining physical activity at work and removing yourself from the task or issue at hand can help, says Andy Magill, a vitality coach at the health insurer VitalityHealth. “This is where meditation and deep breathing can be beneficial, as they allow you to gain a clear mind before returning to address what needs to be done.” Healthy hotdesking Hotdesking, where employees do not have designated seats, is on the rise as employers look to reduce costs. “Hotdesking can be brilliant and evil all at the same time,” says Blood. While getting people to change places every day is thought to create a more collaborative work environment, the ergonomics of the different workspaces could cause health problems. “When ever you go to a new desk you’ve got to take the time to alter it to suit you,” says Blood. “Change the chair height, adjust the back angle, get the screen to the right height. If you can’t adjust things then your employer really needs to look at the hotdesking environment,” she says. Dodging the snacks To work in an office is to run a daily gauntlet of endless snacks, meeting-room sandwiches and pastries and cake-pushing colleagues. The combination of sitting at your desk all day and being surrounded by workplace Bake Off fans can have a negative impact on your health. Healthy snacks do not have to be “boring or sensible and tasteless”, says Nicki Cresswell, a wellbeing coordinator at the Chartered Accountants’ Benevolent Association. “Cheese is a great snack in moderation as is dark chocolate,” she says. Eating a good lunch will also help curb snacking. “Preparing food the night before can seem like a pain but it has great payback, literally,” says Cresswell. Lunches that must be eaten with a knife and fork have the added bonus of preventing you from using your keyboard or taking calls while eating. If it is too much work to prepare, then you can team up with colleagues and take it in turns to bring in a healthy lunch each day. Giles has a simple technique for resisting the temptation to snack, which also helps you get up more and avoid headaches: drink more water. “Your brain often gets confused with thirst versus hunger messages,” he says.

There is some light at the end of the tunnel – the national living wage is due to go up in April, while for homebuyers, house price rises are expected to slow, although this will be tempered by an increase in demand as a result of the lack of housing stock on the market. So with the unlikely events of 2016 behind us, here are some of the key things to look out for in 2017: High street price rises There is expected to be a headache for consumers when they return to the tills as prices rise on the back of fluctuations in the post-EU referendum pound. Spikes in prices on high street goods, ranging from milk and wine to headphones and TVs, are expected as retailers’ hedges against currency fluctuations – a form of insurance policy against movements in the pound – end. Apple Mac users saw raised prices on machines in October as the technology giant updated the cost in line with the low exchange rate between the dollar and sterling. Raid on buy-to-let landlords Former chancellor George Osborne announced in July 2015 a cut in tax relief on mortgage interest payments for buy-to-let landlords. These changes, which will see mortgage interest deductions slashed from 100% to zero, will be phased in between this coming April and April 2020. Instead, when income tax on a landlord’s profits from their property, and any other income sources, are totted up they will be granted a “tax credit” worth 20% of the mortgage interest to offset against income tax, whatever rate they pay. HMRC has estimated that just one in five landlords will be affected by the changes, but representative groups have said it will have a devastating impact on their finances. House prices versus demand Anyone hoping to buy a house in the coming year will be both heartened and dismayed by some of the latest predictions. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has said it expects house price growth to be half that of 2016. However, demand is expected to outstrip supply as a result of insufficient housebuilding. It is expected that the number of sales will reduce from 1.25m in 2016 to between 1.15m and 1.2m. Property firm Savills predicts prices will remain flat across the UK, with falls in the north of England, Wales and Scotland. In the east of England it expects 2.5% growth. Nationwide said it expects the average UK price to increase by 2% over the year, below the rate of growth reported in 2016. More commuter frustration Another year, another train fare increase for weary commuters. The Campaign for Better Transport has estimated that fares have gone up by 23.5% between 1995 and 2016 – and 2017 isn’t expected to show any respite. The rail industry has announced that they will go up by an average 2.3% from 2 January, a move which has been criticised by unions. The increases are being driven by much higher increases on the reprivatised east coast route. While regulated fares, such as season tickets and off-peak returns, which are set by the government, are to increase by 1.9%, fares on Virgin Trains East Coast will go up by 4.9% overall. Increased protections The amount of cash savers will have protected in banks and building societies that go bust is likely to be raised to £85,000 from the end of January because of the slump in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote. The limit was cut to £75,000 in July 2015 when sterling was stronger, to keep the UK banking system in step with the rest of the EU. But the increase is required to keep the UK in line with an EU-wide deposit protection limit of €100,000. A cap on London Airbnb From the spring, Airbnb will ban hosts in London from renting out entire homes for more than 90 days a year without official consent. The San Francisco-based company will automatically stop people letting their homes for more than this limit unless they have the necessary planning permission from a local authority. London is the third biggest city in terms of places to stay on the sharing economy website, with a listing of more than 40,000. It is already against the law to flout the 90-day rule, but local authorities complained of not having the resources or data to enforce it. With the move by Airbnb, there will be automated limits to ensure listings are not shared for more than 90 days. Rise in ‘national living wage’ This will increase from £7.20 to £7.50 an hour from April. The government’s target is for it to reach £9 by 2020. New Isa A lifetime Isa to help young people save for their first home or retirement – or both – will be available from April. The account allows for savings with no tax on the interest earned, and a government contribution equal to 25% of everything saved. The maximum amount which can be saved into the Isa each year is £4,000, and the government will give a £1,000 bonus on that amount. The account can be opened by people at any time between the ages of 18 and 40, and a bonus earned each year until they reach 50. Increase in energy prices Householders should brace themselves for bigger bills when they turn on the lights or put on the kettle. EDF Energy has said it will raise electricity prices by 8.4% from March, with the other “big six” energy providers expected to match the increases. The French company also said that it will cut gas prices by 5.2%, but blamed rising costs for the increase in its electricity tariff. The changes mean that dual-fuel customers (those taking both electricity and gas) with EDF will see their bills rise by 1.2%, to an average of £1,082 a year. The announcement followed a rise in wholesale energy prices, which are up by about a third since last spring. Insurance also on the up It is expected that car insurance will rise from June as insurers pass on higher costs, and the rise in the insurance premium tax takes effect. Drivers typically pay about £50 a year to the Treasury for this, but it will go up to more than £60 from June. Average underlying insurance premiums rose sharply in 2016 on the back of problems with whiplash claims and the cost of replacing advanced technological features such as parking sensors on bumpers after accidents. The AA has said that it expects the average “shop around” premium to break £600 in 2017. And finally … The deadline for online self-assessment tax returns is well publicised as being at the end of January, but that never seems to stop the imaginative excuses for tardy paperwork. HMRC has said that among the excuses rejected this year were someone’s details being engulfed in a yacht fire, while another’s were the victim of a child’s scribbling. If you are filing, do it on time or else risk a fine of at least £100.','https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/jan/02/new-year-2017-commuter-misery-higher-bills-national-living-wage-lifetime-isa','Happy new year? 2017 rings in more commuter misery and higher bills',351,'money'),('culture/2017/jan/02/woodford-folk-festival-2016-review-amanda-palmer-bob-hawke','In 1893, a group of Queensland shearers, disillusioned with the political climate in Australia, set sail for Paraguay, where the government had offered them a chunk of land on which to create their long-dreamed-of socialist utopia. If only they’d held out for another century, their idyllic dreams may well have been realised in Woodfordia, a town that comes into being for six days and nights annually between Christmas and new year in Queensland’s bucolic Sunshine Coast hinterland. During the Woodford Folk festival, Woodfordia swells to become the 67th largest town in Australia – complete with a tent city and purpose-built sewage system. Australia’s answer to the Glastonbury festival, Woodford is the kind of utopian celebration where gendered clothing is completely optional, Bob Hawke is still prime minister (the sprightly octogenarian turns up every year to ride around the 200-hectare site in a buggy, giving the occasional talk and performance), tastebuds can indulge in everything from mango slushies to Yemenite malawach, and the undulating gravel streets have delightful names such as Lamington Drive and Ididitmy Way. The fact they were puritanical bores proved to be those 19th century utopia-seekers’ undoing. The Woodford Folk festival, however, knows how to dial up the fun – going beyond just a music festival to offer an all-ages, choose-your-own-adventure experience replete with everything from circus performances and dance workshops to comedy debates. With 438 events across 35 performance venues, at any given moment you could be rocking out to the latest up-and-coming indie band, taking a marionette-making class, listening to Dr Karl Kruszelnicki pontificate about time travel, or hearing Indigenous singers revive long-lost songs from the mission days. Woodford is also what happens when you’re making other plans, whether it’s making new friends at a communal dining table, being sucked into a raunchy late-night cabaret show or discovering a passion for lindy hop while en route to see a band. From the welcome ceremony on 27 December (where Bob Hawke regaled us with a rousing, if not always in-tune, version of Waltzing Matilda), Woodford’s message was: “We’re all connected.” The festival makes an effort to bring people together at every turn, from its morning partner yoga classes to its unique postal system, which allows you to send a handwritten letter to an unknown recipient. This year’s festival drew a record 132,000 patrons, and there’s no doubt the Trump effect helped tickets fly, that people sought in Woodford an antidote to a world where hope and progressive values seemed to be retreating faster than Arctic ice. Since its strictly folky beginnings in Maleny 31 years ago, Woodford has proved a launching pad for many emerging Australian musicians – Kate Miller-Heidke and John Butler Trio are just two of the acts whose careers took off after playing the festival. This year’s standout newcomer was Melbourne singer-songwriter Tash Sultana, who drew more than 10,000 people to her Wednesday night amphitheatre set. At just 21 years old, the multi-instrumentalist and tattoo-armed loopologist commanded her harem of guitars with Hendrix-esque flair. Her vocal gymnastics ranged from falsetto to gravelly screams, and when she began beat-boxing into a pan flute, the crowd went berserk. Strict scheduling meant Sultana was denied an encore, which fired up the usually laidback Woodford crowd. One audience member, however, preferred to seize the adrenaline-fuelled aftermath of Sultana’s blistering set by proposing to his girlfriend. The strong lineup of women musicians also saw memorable sets from Australian rock royalty Adalita, melting harmonies from Melbourne duo Oh Pep!, satirical cabaret from Meow Meow, a heroic string-busting performance in high 30s heat from Ireland’s Wallis Bird, and a candid set from Amanda Palmer, whose odes to Vegemite and maps of Tasmania segued perfectly into her warmly received announcement that she and husband Neil Gaiman have been granted five-year working visas for Australia. Humour was also a big winner at this year’s festival – from comedians Dave Callan, Judith Lucy, Rod Quantock, Corey White and Otto &amp; Astrid, to US singer and former Rugburns frontman Steve Poltz, whose outrageous anecdotes (did he and Jewel really go whale watching with Mexican police on a trip that culminated in a shootout with a gang of drug dealers?) had the audience in hysterics. The Auslan (Australian sign language) interpreters stationed stageside also provided plentiful humour, not least when performers took delight in deliberately saying suggestive words then swivelling their heads towards the red-faced interpreter forced to sign it. As always, the climax of Woodford was New Year’s Eve, starting at sunset with a classical Indian concert on the hilltop stage, which commands 270-degree views of the hinterland and Glass House mountains. At 11.30pm, the entire festival momentarily shut down for the annual ritual of three minutes of candlelit silence. Six days of clear skies held out for the well-attended hilltop sunrise ceremony on New Year’s Day, where Tibetan monks chanted in the first rays of 2017. The desire for positive new beginnings after a year of political tumult and the deaths of music legends was at the forefront of many people’s minds. This was evident in the fortune tellers doing a roaring trade; in the performers’ tributes to artists such as Leonard Cohen, and in the wild abandonment with which the audience danced to the upbeat strains of 11-piece brass ensemble Hot Potato Band. No one seemed to mind that the talks were essentially a progressive echo chamber – the Woodford crowd loved that Professor Ian Lowe, journalist Karen Middleton, Affluenza author Richard Denniss and Dr Karl Kruszelnicki all broadly agreed on strategies for “fixing Australia”; they lapped up Chaser member Charles Firth’s prediction that Anthony Albanese would be the next Labor prime minister; and there were huge cheers when indigenous Canadian singer and activist Buffy Sainte-Marie declared: “People power inspired by good vibes … is more important than politics.” But it was Amanda Palmer – whose Friday night Q&amp;A session quickly turned into mass group therapy – who had the wisest words as we all stared headlong into the 2017 abyss. “I refuse to be afraid,” said Palmer. “Even Donald Trump coming from one side and Brexit the other, I would like to believe that we as a human society are fundamentally protective of us; that we’re going to figure it out.”','https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/jan/02/woodford-folk-festival-2016-review-amanda-palmer-bob-hawke','Woodford Folk festival 2016 review – a celebration of optimism',352,'culture'),('tv-and-radio/2017/jan/02/mondays-best-tv-silent-witness-the-affair-first-dates-hotel','The Hairy Bikers’ Comfort Food 4.15pm, BBC1 Cooking to drive away the mid-winter blues.

Jonathan Wright An Island Parish: Anguilla 8.30pm, BBC2 The return of this unfussy, curiously compelling show following some of the world’s further-flung congregations. This series touches down on the British overseas territory of Anguilla, where it has plenty to work with – the 14,000 locals are sufficiently pious to fill 19 churches. The focus is on the Anglican flock of St Mary’s, whose affable bishop, Errol Brooks, has an enviable beat, ministering to several other equally glorious-looking islands. Andrew Mueller Silent Witness 9pm, BBC1 Even in its 20th series, this forensics drama can’t be accused of living in the past. The case at the heart of this latest run is a timely, if occasionally clunky, exploration of issues surrounding the refugee crisis. The first episode of this two-parter (which concludes tomorrow) is a tangled web of desperation and exploitation, with Emilia Fox’s Dr Nikki Alexander at its bleeding, liberal heart. Generic, but still a noble attempt to put a human face to an intractably vast problem. Phil Harrison The Halcyon 9pm, ITV A decent new period drama that introduces two entwined families running a posh London hotel in the early months of the second world war. The manager and his receptionist daughter (Steven Mackintosh and Hermione Corfield) have a complex history with the lord and lady owners (Alex Jennings and Olivia Williams); they lend class to an info-dump opener full of affairs, intrigue and debate. It doesn’t put a foot wrong, but it doesn’t linger in the mind, either.

Tensions mount between Washington and Moscow. Russian diplomats are expelled by the US president. Is this a second cold war? No: it is the first hotdesk war. Its soldiers can work anywhere, on laptops, in internet cafes, or in the heart of the Russian intelligence establishment. Their weapons are bytes, not bullets. Their mushroom cloud is digital chaos. This is Theresa May’s first full-blooded geopolitical challenge (Brexit was part of her inheritance). To date, Barack Obama has responded to Russia’s cyber-attacks during the US presidential election with a range of sanctions; Vladimir Putin has declined, for transparently tactical reasons, to retaliate; and Donald Trump has taken to Twitter to praise the Russian president’s decision as “very smart!” (Isn’t there something especially pleading about that exclamation mark?) The prime minister must now decide how to position herself in this spaghetti western standoff between the Good, the&nbsp;Mad and the Fugly. She could do nothing, of course. But that would be a craven lapse into paralysis, given the manner in which she has handled Putin in recent months. In October she accused Russian forces of “sickening atrocities” in Aleppo, and undertook to send 800 troops to Estonia, one of four Nato battalions dispatched to deter&nbsp;Russian aggression. In November, the prime minister declared that the west needed to “keep up the pressure on Russia” over its conduct in Syria. Meanwhile, she authorised the transfer to Estonia of high-precision long-range missiles to be deployed alongside drones, tanks and RAF jets. I doubt that May ever believed Putin could be driven out of Syria. But the buildup of forces in the Baltics is an unambiguous warning to him not to push his luck. She knows too that conventional warfare is but the half of it. As Andrew Parker, director-general of MI5, said in his Guardian interview last year, Russia “is using its whole range of state organs and powers to push its foreign policy abroad in increasingly aggressive ways – involving propaganda, espionage, subversion and cyber-attacks. Russia is at work across Europe and in the UK today.” In this context, May can hardly now pick up the pom-poms and join Trump on the cheerleading mat. And just to remove any doubt, her allies are categorical that there will be no strategic shift in response to a single tweet by the president-elect. As a starter, she indicated over the weekend that Russian oligarchs with links to Putin would no longer be welcome at Tory fundraising events – hardly a dagger in Moscow’s flesh, but a clear enough indication that she has no intention of following Trump down the road of appeasement. Still, he is going to be president in less than three weeks. It is central to the prime minister’s vision of Britain’s place in a post-Brexit world that the “special relationship” should survive and prosper, especially in the form of a new bilateral trade deal. Her allies were delighted that Trump raised the precedent of Ronald Reagan’s bond with Margaret Thatcher in his first phone call with May. To be fair, they are realistic: nobody knows how the 45th president will respond to the counsel and promptings of his foreign counterparts. But Team May is determined at least to try. Aside from the prime minister’s forthcoming visit to Washington, there are plans for senior No 10 staff to make a separate trip&nbsp;to meet their opposite numbers in&nbsp;the new White House. The specific conundrum May faces is that the standoff between Russia and&nbsp;the US is (apparently) about to yield&nbsp;place to a love-in. The greater threat in the era of Trump and Putin is not conflict but convergence – and not a&nbsp;convergence of peace, but a new struggle on many fronts, within and between nations, in which Russia and the US are on the same side. Already, one can see the lineaments of that struggle: internationalists versus nativists; autocracy versus liberalism; traditionalism versus pluralism. It is fast rendering obsolete the old matrix of left-right, and east versus west. Trump and Putin are very different politicians. One is a tycoon and television star; the other a pitiless product of the KGB. But in this newly ordered world they are potential allies – of the worst sort. How chilling are the resonances with Nineteen Eighty-Four – and particularly the passages from “The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism” read by Winston Smith. This text describes a world in which great geopolitical blocs are “not divided by any genuine ideological difference”, in which “the fighting, when there is any, takes place on the vague frontiers whose whereabouts the average man can only guess at”, and in which the “cultural integrity” of each bloc is its true priority. From this fictional warning, it is not such a great leap to Trump’s Oceania and Putin’s Eurasia. To persist with the metaphor, May’s priority must be to dash any hopes the president-elect may have that Britain will be a wholly compliant Airstrip One. In this respect, she faces a more nuanced diplomatic challenge than confronted, say, Thatcher or Tony Blair. Reagan and his “dear friend, Margaret” agreed on practically everything. Blair and George W Bush were from different sides of the political divide, but discovered common ground after 9/11. It is self-evident that Trump and the prime minister do not enjoy any such identity of conviction. Yes, they are conservatives who share a core belief in the primacy of the nation-state. But on Nato, protectionism, climate change, Islam and much else, they differ fundamentally. May’s mission is to find common ground without selling out. It is a task of spectacular complexity. On Russia, however, she cannot budge an inch. Her task as the only G8 leader in Europe not facing an election in the next 18 months is to confront Trump with the ineluctable facts about Putin: that he is an inveterate regional aggressor, a globally active enemy of democracy, and a mostly unchecked threat to the stability of the west. That his campaign of cyberwarfare alone mandates those nations he has targeted to enact further sanctions – and not only&nbsp;the symbolic kind. Somebody needs to tell the president-elect that his political crush on Putin, as well as dividing his own party and country, and splitting the west, will send&nbsp;the worst possible signal&nbsp;to an autocrat just waiting for the&nbsp;green light. As the Iron Lady once said: this is no time to go wobbly.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/02/may-trump-truth-putin-russian-aggression','It is now May’s task to tell Trump the truth about Putin | Matthew d’Ancona',354,'commentisfree'),('books/2017/jan/02/100-best-nonfiction-books-no-48-the-economic-consequences-of-the-peace-john-maynard-keynes-jm','The Economic Consequences of the Peace is one of those rare books that seem to exude brilliance, power and polemical passion from the opening page, propelled by the urgency and consequence of the subject. Unlike some other rhetorical classics in this list, it executes its argument with a rapier not a blunderbuss, using the clinical ferocity of hammered steel not wild, explosive irruptions of outrage. Reading Keynes in 2017, nearly a hundred years after first publication, you don’t have to know the diplomatic minutiae of the Versailles peace treaty, a notorious historical disaster, to appreciate that here is a brilliant writer (who would subsequently become a great economist) flexing his intellectual muscles for the first time on the world stage. Uniquely, too, this is a book whose subject is economics but whose message is geopolitical. It’s a book, moreover, suffused with a deep and compelling sense of imminent catastrophe: “In Paris, where those connected with the Supreme Economic Council received almost hourly the reports of the misery, disorder and decaying organisation of all central and eastern Europe, allied and enemy alike, and learned from the lips of the financial representatives of Germany and Austria unanswerable evidence of the terrible exhaustion of their countries, an occasional visit to the hot, dry room in the president’s house, where the Four fulfilled their destinies in empty and arid intrigue, only added to the sense of nightmare.” At the time, The Economic Consequences of the Peace created an instant controversy. Keynes was the official representative of the British Treasury at the negotiations in Paris. He was in the room during all the crucial discussions about “making Germany pay”, saw the protagonists of the treaty (Woodrow Wilson, Lloyd George and Clemenceau) in action at first hand, and was able to witness for himself the making of an international catastrophe: “My … most vivid impression is of … the president [Wilson] and the prime minister [Lloyd George] as the centre of a surging mob and a babel of sound, a welter of eager, impromptu compromises and counter-compromises, all sound and fury signifying nothing, on what was an unreal question anyhow, the great issues of the morning’s meeting forgotten and neglected; and Clemenceau silent and aloof on the outskirts…” Keynes’s arguments for a more generous settlement were prescient. Above all, he saw with unique clarity the geopolitical tenor and perspective expressed by the Big Four, a combination of grandeur, vanity and vengeance that would shape Europe after the great war and send it spiralling towards an even bigger catastrophe. Keynes was so disturbed by what he saw that ultimately he resigned out of the conviction that the great powers were hell-bent on drafting an unjust settlement with immeasurably terrible consequences. Keynes, who was also a member of the Bloomsbury group, wrote The Economic Consequences of the Peace in the months after his resignation, developing a devastating argument to show that the treaty was not only unfair but potentially dehumanising in its effects. The reparation measures of the Versailles treaty, he demonstrates with clinical clarity, would wreck the German economy, impoverish the German people and undermine all future hopes for peace and reconciliation. Scholars will argue about the extent to which the great German inflation of the 1920s, the first step in the rise of fascism, was a by-product of the treaty’s provisions, but what Keynes brilliantly identified was the necessary interaction of sound economic policy across Europe in the maintenance of international peace among nations. This is a book that some Brexiters might do well to reread. Keynes’s essay immediately became a worldwide bestseller. It rapidly became the source of conventional left-liberal wisdom on the treaty. In its mature form, this was the widespread opinion that the final document imposed on the defeated Germans at Versailles on 28 June 1919 (exactly five years after the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand) was a recklessly punitive, “Carthaginian” settlement. Another international consequence of Keynes’s work was that his book helped to consolidate American public opinion against the treaty. Woodrow Wilson never got the treaty ratified by Congress, and the failure of his vision for a new world soured the rest of his presidency, and possibly contributed to his stroke. As a result, America’s commitment to, and involvement in, the League of Nations was never more than half-hearted. In a real sense this would shape the allies’ interwar response to a resurgent Germany under the Nazis. In turn, the perception among the British public that Germany had been treated unfairly would fuel the 1930s policy of “appeasement”, a policy that would, in the end, lead to the outbreak of the second world war. The Economic Consequences of the Peace made JM Keynes internationally famous, and established his reputation as a provocative and leading economist, a reputation that would be consolidated by the publication of his masterpiece, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1936). And yet, for the general reader who wants to engage with the mind of Keynes at its most accessible, and entertaining, The Economic Consequences of the Peace makes perfect reading. Moreover, it is one of those very rare titles whose influence lasted long into the future. After the end of the second world war, when Keynes became a key player in establishing the Bretton Woods agreements of 1944, he remembered the lessons from Versailles as well as the depression of the 1930s. As is often pointed out, it was the Marshall plan of 1945 that came most closely to resemble the ideas of systematic reconciliation first proposed by Keynes in The Economic Consequences of the Peace.

Known locally as Hary Tanoe, the tycoon is building two Trump developments – a 100-hectare, six-star luxury resort on the coast of Bali and a resort outside Jakarta with a championship golf course designed by former world No 1 Ernie Els. The resort will have 300 villas and adjoin a theme park. Both projects are due to be completed while Trump is in office. Unlike Trump before his presidential run, the 50-year-old has already delved deeply into politics. Tanoe made a failed attempt in 2014 to get the nomination for vice-president and has since set up his own political party, United Indonesia, using Twitter and appearances on his TV stations as a platform. His company, Global Mediacom, also known as MNC Group, saw stocks rise significantly when Trump won the election in November. Tanoe said he has “access” to Trump although it was limited and most of his contact regarding the joint developments was with the president-elect’s adult children; Donald Jr, Eric and Ivanka. “Each of them has different roles. Don Jr has responsibility for the overall project, Eric the design and golf, and Ivanka more of detail – the fit-out of the hotel,” he said. Vast foreign business interests held by an incoming president have been flagged as a potential conflict of interests, especially if the ventures are linked to businesspeople with aspirations for power. In Indonesia’s last election, Tanoe threw his support behind former general Prabowo Subianto, who went on to lose to Joko Widodo, meaning Trump’s biggest financial stake in Indonesia is run by a political adversary to the country’s leader. And Tanoe has already arranged for two controversial Indonesian politicians to meet Trump. The first was Setya Novanto, the speaker of the House of Representatives who was at the centre of a $US4bn corruption scandal in Indonesia. He denies all allegations. The second was Fadli Zon, the deputy speaker, who is close to Indonesian religious hardliners who have been pushing for Jakarta’s governor to be jailed for blasphemy. Governor Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, known by his nickname Ahok, is fighting a racially charged attempt to prevent him from winning a second term next month by Islamists who are against a Christian Indonesian of Chinese heritage being in power. But Tanoe, also a Chinese Indonesia Christian, said the country was ready for a leader of any background. “The majority of the people are more realistic. They want to see a leader who can bring solutions,” he said. He blamed the president, known as Jokowi, for not responding “quickly enough” to quell protests in that capital that saw roughly half-a-million people rally against Ahok on 2 December. “The issue is more with President Jokowi. He has to show his leadership is firm enough to make people calm down.”','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/02/donald-trumps-indonesian-business-partner-considers-running-for-president','Donald Trump\'s Indonesian business partner considers running for president',356,'world'),('australia-news/2017/jan/02/childcare-shortage-fears-as-demand-for-subsidised-places-to-swell-by-300000','New parents may struggle to find childcare places over the next three years as the number of children accessing subsidised care swells by nearly 300,000. Figures in the government’s midyear budget update, released in December, show the number of children accessing subsidised childcare is expected to grow by almost 300,000 by 2020, from 1.7 million in 2016-17 to 2 million in 2019-20. Labor has warned the extra demand would require up to 1,600 new long daycare centres, or 2,300 new outside school hours care services, and said the Turnbull government’s proposed childcare changes would do nothing to boost the supply of places. “Despite knowing about this looming crisis, Malcolm Turnbull has no plans to help families struggling with chronic waiting lists,” Kate Ellis, Labor’s spokeswoman on early childhood education warned. “If parents can’t get a childcare place, they can’t return to work,” she said on Monday. “It’s one thing to fund places but if the services don’t exist then that is of no assistance to any parent.” But the education minister, Simon Birmingham, blasted Ellis’s characterisation of the expected growth in subsidised places as a looming crisis. He said his reforms would encourage the private sector to build more childcare centres to cater for the influx. “It’s absolutely correct that around 300,000 additional places are budgeted [and] forecast to be created, and that means new centres,” he said. “I’m not going to predict how many new centres that will be, but we can be absolutely confident based on the fact there have been many new centres in the last two years ... that if we can get our childcare reforms through the parliament ... there will be new centres built in the future to fill those 300,000 spots.” Ellis told the National Press Club in October that the government should consider abandoning the childcare subsidy system in favour of alternatives including universal childcare or the government directly purchasing places. The government had no “levers of control” over the costs and availability of places, and there was no mechanism to cap parents’ out-of-pocket costs nor to make sure that places were available in areas of undersupply, she said. She also questioned whether the $10bn the federal government contributed to childcare was well spent considering the industry made $1bn of profit. But Birmingham said the rate of growth in childcare prices had decreased to about 5.2% in the year to September 2015, well below the 10-year September quarter average of 6.7%, and 7.4% during Labor’s last term in office. He said his reforms would end the midyear cut-out of childcare assistance that plagued many families, while putting in place new measures to constrain fee growth. “If the Labor party is seriously concerned about helping Australian families access affordable childcare then they would support our solutions in the parliament as soon as possible,” he said.','https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jan/02/childcare-shortage-fears-as-demand-for-subsidised-places-to-swell-by-300000','Childcare shortage fears as demand for subsidised places to swell by 300,000',357,'australia-news'),('environment/2017/jan/02/surprise-sunset-paints-sheffield-sky','The window of my room here looks south-west, over the rooftops of a Sheffield suburb draped over the foothills of the Pennines, and through it I watch the endless traffic of the sky all day; the fleets of clouds steaming past on their journey from coast to coast, the planes etching contrails that wobble tipsily in the winds. Recently, the sky has seemed muted, in the way it often does when the light is at its leanest and the weather settles for grey neutrality. But a marvel of midwinter is how even the most austere, threadbare days can give rise to the most lavish of sunsets. At this time of year, the sun sets directly before the window, often inducing me to leave my desk and walk a few streets to where, in that typically Sheffield way, the city abruptly terminates, and clean-scrubbed streets of bungalows give way instantly to expanses of high-raised farmland. From here, long arms of land slope down into the city, beyond which the only things interrupting the flat horizon are distant cooling towers. A huge feeling of space pervades; the sky can seem so big up here it produces a sort of inverted vertigo. The strangest example of a surprise sunset happened a few days ago. All day the sky had been white noise, as if nature had decided it was not worth filling in the space. But shortly before the day died, luridly bright streaks of pink and purple began appearing, then spread like a bright bruise until a whole half of the sky was soaked in neon. It was a sunless sunset, as if it emanating from within the cloud itself. Abstracted from its source, the glow had an eerie, almost lifelike phosphorescence, and perhaps even something of the arctic magic of the aurora. A living smoke of starlings curled above the treetops, and an owl swooped on something in a dark fold of field. After 15 minutes, the furnace-glare of the Sheffield sky breathed its last and the long, cold night descended again.

The government will consider whether its “one-way door” policy in entertainment precincts, due to be introduced in February, is unnecessary in light of a pending justice department review of data on late-night assaults. It is weighing up whether a strengthened identification scanning and banning scheme run by licensed venues, as well as other options, are a viable alternative, the Courier-Mail reported. This follows recent negotiations between the government and venue operators, amid an anti-lockout campaign by music scene advocates including the prominent construction company chief and live venue owner Scott Hutchinson. The justice department is analysing assault numbers since the winding back of late-night trading hours from 5am to 3am and the banning of high-alcohol shots after midnight last July. The deputy premier, Jackie Trad, said she understood it was a “passionate issue” but the government would “not preempt the research data” on the first six months of those changes, due in coming weeks. Trad did not rule out scrapping the lockout. “The government has honoured an election commitment by introducing laws that reduce the hours when alcohol can be served after midnight,” she said. “All the evidence in Australia and overseas shows that reducing the service of alocohol after midnight is the most effective measure to reduce alcohol-fuelled violence.” Hutchinson, who had vowed to bankroll a campaign to trigger a youth vote backlash against the government in the next state election, said its newfound openness to alternatives to a lockout was “wonderful news”. He said the lockout would kill the live music scene and he was aware of local musicians who had already moved to Melbourne in anticipation of its effect. “If [the government is] able to admit their mistakes, it’s a good thing,” he said, adding he was among those who had held talks with the government in recent months. “I think it’s certainly heading in the right direction [but] we just don’t know what they’re going to give us. Ultimately we’d like music to have the same rights as gambling, which is 24/7 at the casinos. “But we’re making some progress, which is great to see.” To protest against the social effects of a lockout, Hutchinson commissioned an artwork by Los Angeles-based Jonathan Zawada, Blackout in a Glasshouse, and installed it last month in the Brunswick Street mall, at the heart of Brisbane’s Fortitude Valley party precinct. Hutchinson said Brisbane’s music scene was already under pressure from inner-city gentrification and the government should be following the lead of cities overseas like Berlin and Amsterdam and take steps to foster that local culture. Acting opposition leader, Deb Frecklington, said speculation about the government scrapping a 1am lockout, if true, amounted to “a backflip of epic proportions”. She called on Annastcaia Palasczuk to “come back from holidays, hose down the speculation and rule out the 1am lockout laws once and for all”. “The 1 February start date has not yet been scrapped,” Frecklington said. “What we have is the wannabe premier Jackie Trad trying to cash in on Annastacia Palaszczuk’s absence by grabbing a headline, all the while refusing to guarantee that the lockout will go. “The LNP opposition has tirelessly pressured the Palaszczuk Government to scrap these bad laws. Laws that would punish the majority for the sins of a few. Laws that would have devastated the state’s hard-fought reputation as a world-class cultural and entertainment destination. Laws that would have cost thousands of jobs. “For two years Queenslanders and licensed venues have been under a cloud of uncertainty with Labor’s nanny state lockout laws and all they’ve been handed today is more ambiguity and mixed messages.” The Palaszczuk government, under pressure from Katter’s Australian party crossbenchers, had deferred the lockout, which was part of its platform to tackle drink-fuelled violence at the last election in response to a number of highly publicised fatal assaults. The New South Wales premier, Mike Baird, last month announced a relaxation in that state’s lockout laws that would extend closing hours to 3.30am and the lockout to 2am if entertainment was provided. Queensland venue operators have proposed the Palaszczuk government at least delay its introduction of a lockout for another 12 months in exchange for venues upgrading their scanning facilities, the Courier-Mail reported. The government is still consulting on how a mandatory banning regime would work, including how venues – some of which have complained of a reluctance by magistrates courts to order bans on offenders – would enforce it.','https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jan/02/queensland-government-may-dump-plans-for-1am-lockout','Queensland government may dump plans for 1am lockout',359,'australia-news'),('world/2017/jan/01/foreign-nationals-named-among-victims-of-istanbul-attack','Citizens of up to a dozen countries, including seven Saudi nationals and four Iraqis, were among the 39 people killed when a gunman opened fire on New Year’s Eve revellers in a crowded nightclub in Istanbul, Turkish media have said. Local media said the Turkish victims at the Reina nightclub on the Bosphorus waterfront included a policeman, a female security guard and a travel agent. The government in Ankara made no official statement on the victims’ nationalities but the private Dogan news agency said the dead also included two Indians, two Tunisians and one person each from Canada, France, Syria, Israel and Belgium. Turkey’s interior minister, Süleyman Soylu, said earlier that of the 20 victims who had been formally identified, 15 were foreign nationals and five were Turks. The family minister, Fatma Betül Sayan Kaya, said the majority of the injured were foreign, including nationals of Morocco, Lebanon and Libya. On Sunday, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau confirmed a Canadian citizen was among the dead. He said the nation grieved “the senseless loss of a Canadian citizen and remain steadfast in our determination to work with allies and partners to fight terrorism and hold perpetrators to account”. Saudi Arabia did not immediately confirm a death toll for its nationals but issued a strong condemnation of the attack, saying the kingdom was “standing alongside brotherly Turkey against terrorism and extremism”. The Dubai-based broadcaster al-Arabiya cited sources at the Saudi embassy in Istanbul as saying seven Saudi nationals had died and at least 10 were wounded. Istanbul is a major tourist destination for holidaymakers from the Middle East, drawing hundreds of thousands of visitors a year. The Jordanian foreign ministry said three Jordanians had been killed and four injured, according to the Petra news agency, while Tunisia’s foreign ministry said two Tunisians had died. Media reports said the Tunisian victims were a businessman and his wife. Three Lebanese citizens were among those killed in the attack, the country’s foreign ministry said. Four other Lebanese were injured. The ministry named those killed as Elias Wardini, Haykal Mousallem and Rita Shami. Lebanon’s consulate in Istanbul and the state news agency said one of the injured was the daughter of an MP, Estephan El Douaihy. Stephanie Deek, a friend of Moussallem’s wife, said the couple had been at the club when the attacker opened fire. “They were just tourists, married for five months,” she said. “They wanted to find the perfect place to spend New Year’s Eve.” Moussallem’s wife survived. The Lebanese government said it was sending a plane with a medical team to Turkey on Sunday night to bring the wounded back to Beirut. France’s foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, said a woman with French and Tunisian citizenship had been killed, along with her Tunisian husband. Israel’s foreign ministry said one of its citizens had died. Media reports named her as Leann Zaher Nasser, 18, from the Israeli-Arab town of Tira. India named two nationals – Abis Rizvi, the son of a former MP, and Khushi Shah – as among the dead. Morocco’s embassy in Ankara told the MAP news agency that three Moroccans had been wounded. The foreign ministry of Belgium confirmed that a Belgian-Turkish dual national had been killed. Turkish media said Turkey’s dead included Burak Yildiz, 22, a policeman who had been in the force for 18 months, Ayhan Arik, 47, a travel agent, and Hatice Karcilar, a private security guard. Soylu, the interior minister, said that of the Turkish victims, three or four may have been employees of the club. He added that four of the 69 wounded being treated in hospital were in a serious condition. Soylu said the attack was “a massacre, truly inhumane savagery.”','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/01/foreign-nationals-named-among-victims-of-istanbul-attack','Foreign nationals named among victims of Istanbul attack',360,'world'),('world/2017/jan/02/china-smog-millions-start-new-year-shrouded-by-health-alerts-and-travel-chaos','Millions in China rang in the New Year shrouded in a thick blanket of toxic smog, causing road closures and flight cancellations as 24 cities issued alerts that will last through much of the week. On the first day of 2017 in Beijing, concentrations of tiny particles that penetrate deep into the lungs climbed as high as 24 times levels recommended by the World Health Organization. More than 100 flights were cancelled and all intercity buses were halted at the capital’s airport. In the neighbouring port city of Tianjin, more than 300 flights were cancelled while the weather forecast warned thick smog will persist until 5 January. All of the city’s highways were also shut as low visibility made driving hazardous, effectively trapping residents. Across northern China 24 cities issued red alerts on Friday and Saturday, while orange alerts persisted in 21 cities through the New Year holiday. A red alert is the highest level of a four-tier warning system introduced as part of China’s high-profile war on pollution. Decades of economic development have made acrid air a common occurrence in nearly all major Chinese cities, with government-owned coal burning power stations and heating plants and steel manufacturing concentrated in northern provinces the main source of pollution. Smog worsens in the winter as coal burning spikes to provide heat for millions of people. China declared a “war on pollution” in 2014, but has struggled to deliver the sweeping change many had hoped to see and government inspections routinely find pollutions flouting the law. “Why didn’t those polluting industries take a rest for the holiday,” one commenter mused on the Twitter-like Sina Weibo. “New Year’s morning in Beijing, I thought I was blind,” said another, attaching a photo of a window completely darkened with grey haze. Similar posts appeared on Twitter. China’s middle class is increasingly less tolerant of the deadly air, and in December tens of thousands of “smog refugees” decamped to clearer skies. Top destinations included Australia, Indonesia, Japan and the Maldives. That bout of smog saw 460 million people, a population greater than North America, breathing toxic air, according to Greenpeace. As pollution covered swaths of the country on New Year’s Eve, China announced plans to increase coal output to 3.9 billion tonnes by 2020. A study earlier this year found acrid air is linked to at least one million deaths a year, and contributed to a third of all fatalities in major cities, on par with smoking. Another research paper said the smog had shortened life expectancies by five and a half years in parts of China.','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/02/china-smog-millions-start-new-year-shrouded-by-health-alerts-and-travel-chaos','China smog: millions start new year shrouded by health alerts and travel chaos',361,'world'),('sport/2017/jan/01/head-coaches-kubiak-mccoy-and-kelly-end-tenures-as-nfl-season-wraps-up','Two NFL head coaches have been fired on the final Sunday of the regular season, with another set to step down. Gary Kubiak, who won the Super Bowl with the Denver Broncos last season, has decided to end his time in Colorado because of health reasons. The 55 year-old was taken to hospital with a complex migraine in October and also suffered a stroke in 2013 during his time with the Texans. “As I told our team last night, this is an extremely difficult decision to step down as head coach,” Kubiak said in a statement on Monday. “I love to work and I love football, but ultimately the demands of the job are no longer a good fit for me. “I gave everything I had to this team the last two seasons, but this year, in particular, has been tough on me. As hard as it is to leave this position, I know that it’s the best thing for myself, my family and the Denver Broncos.” “His health is the most important thing,” the Broncos star Von Miller said. The San Francisco 49ers made the most dramatic cuts, firing head coach Chip Kelly and general manager Trent Baalke. The 49ers completed their season with a loss to the Seattle Seahawks and a 2-14 record. “I have informed Trent and Chip of my decision to pursue new leadership for our football team,” 49ers CEO Jed York said in a statement. “These types of conversations are never easy, especially when they involve people you respect personally and professionally. “Despite my feelings for Trent and Chip, I felt the decision to change our football leadership was absolutely necessary. The performance of this team has not lived up to my expectations or those of our fans, and that is truly disappointing. We all expected to see this team progress and develop as the season went on, but unfortunately that did not happen. That is why now is the time to find a new direction for this team.” San Francisco will now begin a search for the fourth head coach in four seasons. Baalke admitted his firing was the right decision. “You know, I’ve been here since 2005, and I have a lot of respect for the organization as a whole, and the ownership, the fan base. It’s difficult, but it’s the right thing to do,” Baalke told KNBR Radio. Kelly seemed similarly resigned to his fate before when he spoke to the media before the decision was announced. “I don’t think anything surprises me,” Kelly said. “I live my life in vision, not circumstances, so I control what I can control, and what we can control is how we coach our players and the way we deal with them. If that’s good enough, then that’s good enough, if it’s not good enough, then so be it. I’m proud of the way our guys played today.” Meanwhile, the San Diego Chargers fired Mike McCoy after the team finished bottom of the AFC West for the second season in succession. McCoy was head coach in San Diego for four seasons and finished with a 27-37 record. “Our team’s disappointing performance has not matched this team’s potential and has fallen short of the demanding standards that we seek to impose throughout our organization,” John Spanos, the Chargers’ president of football operations, said in a statement. The Chargers are currently considering whether to move the franchise to Los Angeles.','https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/01/head-coaches-kubiak-mccoy-and-kelly-end-tenures-as-nfl-season-wraps-up','Head coaches Kubiak, McCoy and Kelly end tenures as NFL season wraps up',362,'sport'),('world/2017/jan/02/more-than-1290-people-die-on-australian-roads-in-2016-up-from-1209','More than 1,290 people died on Australian roads in 2016, confirming the nation has experienced its second spike in road deaths in as many years. Most states and territories have now released their final road toll figures for last year. In New South Wales 384 people were killed, 291 died in Victoria, 250 in Queensland, 193 in Western Australia, 87 in South Australia, 38 in Tasmania and 10 in the ACT. The Northern Territory’s road toll appeared to stand at 45, although the territory’s police could not be contacted for confirmation on Monday. That would give a preliminary road toll of at least 1,298, up from 1,209 last year, and the record low of 1,153 in 2014. The successive rises in the road toll have bucked an otherwise long-term downward trend, which has seen the road toll reduce by huge numbers since 1970, when 3,798 people died. The infrastructure and transport minister, Darren Chester, described the 2016 road toll as a tragedy of national proportions on Sunday. He suggested that parents should be spending a bit more on helping their teenage children buy a newer car. The remarks drew criticism from Labor, but Chester defended them again on 2UE radio on Monday. “Now, we can’t just keep on doing the same thing and thinking that we are going to get a better result, and I think emphasising the need to purchase a safer car if you can afford it, the safest car you can afford to buy, is an important part of this whole discussion, along with making sure governments don’t shirk their responsibility,” Chester said. Chester also suggested that infrastructure investment should be directed more towards road safety. “We already have a road black-spots program, we have got a roads to recovery program with local councils, and we have got a $50bn infrastructure spend under the current federal government,” he said. “So there’s a lot of things going on but we need to pull them all together and then accept we have responsibility as drivers. It’s about safer drivers in safer cars on safer roads. It’s a combination of factors. We can do better than we are doing at the moment.” Western Australia recorded one of the worst results, up from 161 the previous year and the state’s worst for eight years. The RAC’s general manager of corporate affairs in WA, Will Golsby, said the 2016 figure was 16 more than the five-year average and higher than the national average. “Every life lost on WA roads is one too many and each has a lasting ripple effect in the community,” Golsby said on Monday. “A preliminary count shows that 33 more people were killed on West Australian roads in 2016 than the year prior.” Golsby said the increase was largely attributable to more deaths on regional roads and motorcyclist fatalities. Two more people died in Perth on New Year’s Day. The latest results do nothing to help Australian governments reach their shared goal of a 30% reduction in road deaths between 2011 and 2020. Chester and his state and territory counterparts met late last year to discuss the rising road toll, agreeing it was unacceptable and committing to a greater emphasis on safety in infrastructure investment. The ministerial council also agreed to increase drug-driving testing, and strengthen public awareness campaigns on distracted driving. South Australia managed to improve its road toll in 2016, recording its best result on record. The 87 deaths on its roads were 15 fewer than 2015, and below the previous record of 94 in 2012. The road safety minister, Peter Malinauskas, said it still meant too many people were dying on the roads. “Road crashes have a devastating impact on families. The pain and emotional impact on victims and their loved ones, particularly at this time of year, is immeasurable,” Malinauskas said. “As a community, let’s do what we can to ensure that 2017 is another record low for fatalities on our roads,” he said. The national holiday road toll, starting on 23 December, stood at 33 by Monday afternoon. Eight people had died in NSW, nine in Victoria, six in Queensland, five in Western Australia, four in South Australia, one in the Northern Territory and none in the ACT or Tasmania.','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/02/more-than-1290-people-die-on-australian-roads-in-2016-up-from-1209','Australian road deaths rise for second year, reaching almost 1,300 in 2016',363,'world'),('world/2017/jan/02/memories-scared-karen-refugees-haven-victoria','From his hat to his sock protectors, Eh Hta Dah Shee is a park ranger. The 25-year-old Karen man, known as Dutchie, has spent the past four years volunteering at the Werribee Park mansion and at Serendip sanctuary, in Melbourne’s outer west. He keeps to a strict schedule: Tuesday and Wednesday at Werribee Park, Thursday with the animals of Serendip wildlife sanctuary, Friday back at Werribee for the weekly lunch hosted by members of the Karen or Pwa Ka Nyaw community. The project is part of a joint program run by Parks Victoria and Australian Migrant Employment Services (Ames) called Working Beyond the Boundaries, which is designed to help members of the Karen community gain the skills and confidence necessary to join the workforce. On this Friday we find Dutchie in the vegetable garden. He has accessorised his ranger’s uniform – provided in recognition of his efforts by the ranger-in-charge, James Brincat – with a pair of wraparound sunglasses secured with a waterproof strap and a walkie-talkie clipped to his belt. The chickens are laying well, he says, but not as well as Evelyn, one of the senior volunteers at the garden and a leader in Melbourne’s Karen community, would like. Dutchie opens a hutch to reveal a cluster of fresh, brown eggs. They get about 20 a day, he says. Next to the chook pen is a plot of carefully staked-out green beans. It’s off to one side of the main vegetable garden, which sits in the centre of a neatly mown area encircled by buildings that were once used as stables or coaching houses for the mansion. Several of the buildings still contain two-wheeled buggies, gathering dust. The vegetable garden started in 2011 and is run entirely by volunteers. Most are refugees who fled the Karen conflict in Myanmar during the 60-year civil war. Hundreds of thousands of Karen people were killed in the conflict and about 140,000 made it across the border to refugee camps in Thailand. Just over 3,000 have been settled in Victoria. The main languages spoken between gardeners are various Karen dialects, which are also tentatively spoken by Brincat, who has been learning with Dutchie’s help. There are occasional conversations in Burmese or Thai. Many of the volunteers, including Dutchie, are shy about their English skills. When they are unsure of a word, they look to Brincat. “[When I] first started and then I’m shy and nervous when I see the people, the new people,” Dutchie told Guardian Australia. “I looking down on the ground when the people talk to me – I am shy and hide. Now I am getting good. Speak with the people.” The project is loosely connected to another Ames program that helped 160 Karen people settle in the small town of Nhill, 374km north-west of Melbourne, primarily to work for the poultry producer Luv-a-duck. That program has contributed $40m to the local economy, Ames says. Some volunteers, including Dutchie, who has learning difficulties, are unable to transition to work but continue to help the park. His favourite days are the ones when he gets to work with Hsar Thein Ju, another Karen refugee who was hired as a trainee ranger last year. Dutchie describes the steps he follows to prepare food for different animals at the wildlife sanctuary before listing his two reservations: he won’t deal with spiders (“I do not like them,” he says, shuddering) and he won’t handle all the snakes (“When they got poison, I don’t want to touch it”). “I don’t want to stay home because [I’m] just alone, I’m lonely, I don’t want to be like that,” he says. “I need a friend and I don’t have friends, so I just go out.” Making friends has been difficult for Dutchie. He arrived in Australia when he was 13, the youngest of five siblings. His older siblings have all since left home. Like many Karen who found their way to Australia, his family had lived in Mae La refugee camp in Thailand’s Tak province, near the Myanmar border. It was a violent place, he says: “The people were fighting or hurting each other, and when I come here I’m scared of people ... They kill each other, they don’t care. No one cares about it. They pull them to the side of the road and just leave them.” Until December, when his mother took him back to Thailand to visit family, he had only been on a plane once. His primary memory of that first flight, which took him to Australia, is of embarrassment: he had accepted the flight attendant’s offer of coffee, despite not knowing what it was, and spent several minutes holding the bitter liquid in his mouth trying to find a polite way to spit it out. Dutchie says he prepared for his second flight by watching documentaries about air crash investigations and cheerfully explained that he was looking forward to visiting Thailand provided the plane didn’t go down. The conflict that drove the Karen from their homes is over now, he says, thanks to ceasefires signed between the Karen National Union and the government of Myanmar in 2012 and 2015. Other Karen are less confident of their safety. Evelyn, who goes by her first name only, was 18 when the soldiers came and drove the Karen from their village across the river into Mae La camp. There may be a ceasefire now, she says, but that doesn’t mean the fighting will not start again. Evelyn lived in the camp for 22 years. “My children all born in the refugee camp,” she said. “We stay across the river and we never go back to the Karen side.” Now 53, she says the fear of being persecuted remains. “Our memories are of being scared,” she says. “Sometimes I’m like that. My brother died for the war. Sometimes all of us remember that.” Evelyn worked as a midwife at Mae La but was unable to continue in that profession in Australia because her English was not good enough. Instead she worked in aged care and now spends her days volunteering at the vegetable garden. “When I came here, [it was] like my old village,” she says. “Then I felt very, very nice and very happy. Me, I like the countryside, like this. Not for the city.” She comes every day that it is not raining, and manages the fundraising efforts. On Fridays at 12pm she can be found in the small kitchen in a demountable unit around the back of the coaching houses, collecting money from Parks Victoria staff and guests who want to lunch with the Karen. The food is grown and cooked on site and the money used to buy cooking equipment, seeds and fertiliser. In September they paid for a new commercial stove, installed by some of the parks staff. Not all the volunteers are refugees, or have any connection to the Karen. At the new stove, producing enough pikelets for a junior football team, we find 56-year-old Nancy Reuvino. She pauses to let one of the Karen women inspect the batter, then says: “When I’m home I have no incentive, even though there are things to do … I have no incentive, I just sit around. But when I come here I can sleep at night. So I come here Tuesday and Friday – I don’t do much, I just wash the dishes. Today is the first day I have made pikelets.” English-speaking volunteers are a welcome addition, Evelyn says. They are good for language practice, which is a major drawcard in her campaign to recruit new volunteers. “I tell the new people in my community, ‘If all the time you stay home and are boring, you get bored, and you feel lonely, then you can come here,’” she says. “Before I came here, I was scared, scared to talk with the people, but now I have more confidence ... In the beginning I was very scared of the people here. I try, try, try and then I get more confident. And then I tell the volunteers here, ‘If you come here you have to talk to the other people a lot and then you will feel more confident.’” The confidence is working: a number of volunteers have since found paid jobs in the local area, thanks to a recommendation from Brincat or other park rangers.

The crocodile kept police and residents in Karumba, on the shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria, on high alert for most of Saturday until environment department officials arrived from Cairns, about 700km away, to capture and remove the reptile. The male saltwater crocodile was discovered sunning itself in the backyard of a local house on Karumba’s waterfront Esplanade around 6am on Saturday, later moving to the property’s front gate. Police and locals “initially orchestrated a line of wheelie bins in an attempt to funnel him back towards the water but it became clear he wasn’t keen to move”, police media said in a release. A video uploaded to YouTube captured locals’ disappointment when the crocodile, after taking a few tentative steps in the direction of the shoreline, performed an about face to return to his post at the house’s front gate where he remained for the rest of the day. Officers then decided to surround the crocodile with hay bales to contain him until the wildlife officials arrived from Cairns. The animal was reportedly then hoisted by forklift into a boat as the new year countdown approached on Saturday night. The reptile was in a local holding facility on Monday, with the environment department trying to find it a new home, such as a crocodile farm, a spokeswoman said. A local resident, Danielle Day, told the ABC the crocodile wandered into two accommodation complexes before settling in the residential backyard. “We’ve been here for nearly 10 years and we’ve never seen that happen, like [a crocodile] come up on to the road and come up to where people stay,” she said. Karumba, on the banks of the Norman river with a population of about 500, is billed as a “fishing Mecca” and the inspiration for the Red Hot Chili Peppers song Animal Bar, named after the local pub. The Karumba crocodile was one of almost 400 removed by wildlife officers in 2016 under Queensland’s largely non-lethal management plan for the protected animal. Northern Territory rangers pulled out 223 salties in 2016 – a significant decline from 290 the year before. Ranger Tom Nichols put that down to two poor wet seasons, but this holiday season has been wetter than normal as monsoonal conditions kick in. Most national parks in the Top End are now closed due to croc safety and flooding concerns. Nichols described it as a “very concerning” time of year as river systems join up, and he urged the public to remain vigilant. “Remember that a crocodile will see you before you see them,” he said. “Saltwater crocodiles were removed from many parts of the Territory, including Darwin Harbour, the northern suburbs as well as tidal creeks and inlets, meaning they could be anywhere at any time.” Salties can inhabit freshwater systems, billabongs and low areas subject to flooding. Crocodiles were hunted to near extinction in the NT after the second world war, with only about 3,000 left in the wild in 1971 when they became a protected species. Numbers have since exploded up to 100,000 in the Top End.','https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/02/huge-crocodile-trapped-by-wheelie-bin-barricade-after-appearing-in-queensland-backyard','Huge crocodile trapped by wheelie bin barricade after appearing in Queensland backyard',365,'environment'),('australia-news/2017/jan/02/new-open-range-zoo-will-allow-perth-zoo-to-expand-captive-breeding','A proposed open-range zoo in Western Australia would provide an “essential piece of conservation infrastructure” and allow Perth zoo to build on its internationally renowned captive breeding programs, the environment minister, Albert Jacob, has said. The 700ha zoo is proposed for a nature reserve at Lower Chittering, next to the Avon Valley national park, about 70km north-east of Perth, and would be managed as a second site of the 19ha Perth zoo, located in the city. It was announced as the likely site in November, and on Sunday the WA premier, Colin Barnett, said early environmental assessments had deemed it “absolutely almost perfect for an open-range zoo.” However, the estimated cost of the zoo has doubled in the intervening three months, from $50m-$100m in November to $100m-$200m. No money has been allocated in the state budget. Jacob said in November that both the cost and the estimated timeline for the project, which is anticipated to take between five and 10 years to develop, were “a broad guestimate”. The Perth zoo chief executive, Linda Hunt, said limited space at the South Perth site meant the zoo was no longer getting breeding recommendations for a number of open-range species such as sun bears, and the new site would allow them to build on their breeding programs. “This site is still absolutely fine for tropical animals, for some of our Australian breeding programs, but for large open-range species such as rhinoceroses and elephants, we are not getting breeding recommendations anymore,” Hunt told the ABC. The zoo runs successful breeding programs for native WA species such as the numbat, dibbler and Western Swamp tortoise, which have been used to build up wild populations. It also has a globally recognised Sumatran orangutan breeding program, and is the only zoo in the world to release them into the wild. Hunt said the zoo had the expertise “to really make a difference for wildlife conservation” and that an open-range zoo would allow them to get breeding recommendations for animals such as sun bears and rhinos. “We will get the recommendations when we’ve got larger spaces, when we can have a herd of rhinos and a herd of zebras,” she said. “We will make a real difference.” The announcement has already attracted attention, Jacob said: bear rescue foundation Free The Bears contacted Perth zoo after the plan was announced in November to suggest moving rescued bears there from its south-east Asian sanctuaries. “This would mean a better life for the bears, a great visitor experience, and showcase a strong Western Australian partnership between the group and the zoo,” he said. Barnett, who is also tourism minister, first proposed the idea in 2013, saying that the public expected to see larger African plains species in an open-range environment. In a video posted on Twitter by Barnett on Sunday, Jacob said WA was “already globally positioned at the forefront of threatened species conservation” and the proposed open-range zoo was the next step. “And quite simply, with the animal standards of the 21st century, an open-range zoo is an essential piece of conservation infrastructure,” he said. Sydney’s Taronga zoo has an open-range zoo at Dubbo, as does Zoos Victoria with both Werribee Open Range zoo and Healesville wildlife sanctuary. South Australia has Monarto open-range zoo, partnered with Adelaide zoo. In a statement, Barnett said the site was suitable for both large exotic animals and native Australian animals, and also appropriate for visitor infrastructure such as viewing platforms. “People prefer to see large animals in big open areas similar to their natural habitat,” he said. “While Perth zoo remains excellent for smaller or tropical species, the establishment of an open-range zoo will allow Perth zoo to continue its important breeding and conservation work for the larger open-range animals whose numbers are dramatically declining in the wild.”','https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jan/02/new-open-range-zoo-will-allow-perth-zoo-to-expand-captive-breeding','New open-range zoo will allow Perth zoo to expand captive breeding',366,'australia-news'),('world/2017/jan/02/indias-bank-note-ban-how-modi-botched-the-policy-yet-kept-his-political-capital','Birja’s story is typical – and to an outsider, confounding. The 32-year-old works as a housemaid in Delhi, and like more than one billion Indians, has seen her cash evaporate since November, when India suddenly recalled its two-highest value banknotes. “Poor people like me are in trouble,” she says. Two of her employers have been able to pay her only in expired currency, which needs to be deposited or exchanged at banks. That presents a problem: “I do not have a bank account,” she says. Nor can the 32-year-old spend hours waiting in the long lines that formed outside banks and ATMs the morning after demonetisation was announced, and linger still. “If I stand in queue everyone will be angry,” she says of her bosses. “They will count it as my holiday.” The prime minister, Narendra Modi, has implored Indians to allow 50 days for the the estimated 22bn notes that were removed from the system on 8 November to be gradually replaced. That self-imposed deadline ended on Friday with the majority of the country’s ATMs still bare, and people such as Birja still struggling. “My husband is an auto-rickshaw driver, who earns 300 rupees [£3.60] every day after rent,” she says. “But for last seven days he has not earned anything.” Yet the rupee recall might only be the second most extraordinary political phenomenon India has observed in the past seven weeks. The first is that support for Modi’s scheme, especially among those it has hit hardest, appears to be holding – for now. “I will vote for him again,” Birja says. “He is doing this for poor people. If the black money goes from the market, then everybody will have a better life. He works for the people.” As chief minister of Gujarat, one of India’s wealthier states, Modi cultivated a reputation as a master administrator. But the execution of demonetisation – planned in secret, reportedly by a handful of bureaucrats working from Modi’s residence – has been badly botched. Design changes in the new 500- and 2,000-rupee notes have meant that each of the 220,000 ATMs in India had to be reconfigured one-by-one. Even if they could dispense new cash, there isn’t enough to give: reprinting the equivalent value of physical notes that were eliminated from India’s economy will take until mid-February, at least. Digital payments have reportedly soared, but offer limited relief in a country where 40% still lie “outside the ambit of formal banking”, according to government figures. “The shock has been tremendous and widely spread,” says Anil Bhardwaj, the secretary general of the Federation of Indian Micro and Small &amp; Medium Enterprises. India’s cash economy is estimated to account for 80% of the country’s employment and 45% of its GDP. “And that’s where the impact is biggest” says Bhardwaj. “Because more and more cash is involved in buying raw materials and paying wages to workers. And of course, your customers are paying for your products in cash.” Delhi alone has witnessed an exodus of up to 60% of the migrant workers who laboured for cash in the city’s building sites and factories. In rural areas, villagers have reportedly reverted to bartering or credit. The expected impact has led economists to reduce India’s growth forecast for the quarter from 7.8%, the highest of any major economy in the world, to 6.5%. Worse still for Modi are indications the policy has not unearthed the hoards of “black money” he promised. While the operations of some criminal networks, especially human traffickers, appear to have been disrupted, about 90% of the cancelled notes in circulation have been returned to banks, far more than what the government had estimated. That suggests either that Indians were hiding less untaxed wealth than first believed, or that the money is being stashed in property or gold instead of cash. Few democratic leaders could survive such a bungling of their signature policy, especially one that strands virtually every citizen from their money. No reliable polling has been done on Modi’s standing among Indians since the demonetisation announcement, but public unrest has been relatively contained, and Indian media have not struggled to find supporters of the scheme, even among those waiting in long bank queues. The ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP) has also won several local elections in the country’s western and norther states in the past month, despite the ongoing cash shortages. “It speaks to Modi’s enormous political capital,” says Prashant Jha, an associate editor with the Hindustan Times. Halfway through his term, the Indian prime minister’s popularity is still enormous, measured at 81% by a Pew poll in September. The policy and its subsequent hardships have also been masterfully framed, says Modi biographer Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay. “Modi presented the entire idea of demonetisation as a highly moral act,” he says. He recalled how Modi, in his first address after demonetisation, appeared to break down before the crowd in Goa, saying he had left behind “my home, my family, everything for the nation” and that “the forces up against me ... may not let me live”. “He wore a cloak of morality, presenting that he had risen above personal ambitions for the cause of the nation, and inviting Indians to also sacrifice a little bit for the nation,” Mukhopadhyay says. “He asked them to participate in the process of nation-building by standing in queues.” Demonetisation has also been cast as decisive blow against the elites who profit from India’s endemic corruption, a source of deep resentment among the country’s poor and aspirational classes, who are routinely made to pay bribes for basic government services. “That’s why the majority of the poor are still in favour of this move,” says Bhardwaj, from the small enterprise lobby. “Even while going through the pain, they see it as a leveller, and that at least one powerful political leader has taken a decision that rattles the bigwigs and elites.” The most resounding judgment of the scheme will be delivered early this year when elections are held in Uttar Pradesh. As India’s largest state, with a population the size of Brazil’s, it offers enough seats to secure or scuttle the rest of Modi’s first-term agenda. One close observer, Sharat Pradhan, a veteran political journalist based in the state, suggests Modi might be vindicated. “In this state demonetisation has created a divide between the rich and poor,” he says. “The poorer classes seem to be getting some kind of vicarious pleasure from thinking: ‘I’m facing difficulties by standing in a queue, but the rich people who acquired wealth by dubious means, all their black money is gone.’” Whether these same people feel the pain was worth it, once money starts flowing again, will decide the fate of India’s seemingly indomitable prime minister. “Modi has become a larger-than-life leader,” Pradhan says. “And he is tied up with demonetisation. Everyone down on the street knows that this thing was done by Modi.”','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/02/indias-bank-note-ban-how-modi-botched-the-policy-yet-kept-his-political-capital','India\'s banknote ban: how Modi botched the policy yet kept his political capital',367,'world'),('sport/2017/jan/02/michael-van-gerwen-raymond-van-barneveld-pdc-world-darts-semi-final','There are dream finals, there are probable epics, and there is Gary Anderson versus Michael van Gerwen in the final of the PDC World Championship. The two best players on earth will meet tonight after emphatic victories in the semi-finals. The reigning champion, Anderson, won his 17th consecutive match at the worlds, beating Peter Wright 6-3. The world No1 Van Gerwen’s response was to shatter the record for the highest average in this tournament during his 6-2 win over Raymond van Barneveld. On the oche the two are very similar, rapid-fire geniuses who have taken darts to another level. Their contrasting backstories will add even greater spice. Anderson, champion in the past two years, says he does not need to win; Van Gerwen says a year in which he won 25 tournaments will be a disaster if he does not become world champion. “This means nothing,” he said after the semi-finals. “My hands are still empty. The final is all that counts. I made my goal very clear, and anyone in my path needs to get out of my way.” Van Gerwen’s average of 114.05 was the highest in the history of the world championship, well ahead of Phil Taylor’s 111.21 against Shayne Burgess in 2002. Van Barneveld’s average of 109.34 was easily the highest in defeat at the worlds, beating the record set by Cristo Reyes against Van Gerwen in the tournament. He also hit 68% of his doubles, yet he was so shocked after the game that he said he was “no longer good enough” and talked about retiring in a couple of years. Van Gerwen was inconsolable when he lost to Van Barneveld in the last 16 a year ago. After a poor first set he went looking for revenge with murderous purpose. Van Barneveld started brilliantly, with ton-plus finishes in the first two legs on the way to winning the first set. In the second set, he took out a mighty 160 to break the throw. It stirred the hornet’s nest. An affronted Van Gerwen raised his already stratospheric level of performance. He assaulted the treble 20, and the treble 19, and the treble 18, and double 20, and double 16, and double 18. His performance was full of champagne moments: he hit 15 180s, missed double 12 for a nine-darter and finished the match by taking out two double 18s in one visit. “I showed tonight I was the boss on this stage,” he said. “It was a phenomenal performance from myself but also Raymond. I had to produce my A-game if I wanted to win. This is what I want to do all the time. Everyone thought the Chisnall-Anderson game [in the quarter-finals] was a stunner. Well what do you think about this?” The Anderson-Van Gerwen final could be the best of the lot. Anderson’s match-winning average of 103.84 against Wright, exceptional in a sane world, was made to look modest by the end of the night. He was never behind in a contest that was both high-class and nervy: the scoring was relentless, with 25 180s, yet both players were unusually fragile on doubles. Wright came back from 3-1 to 3-3 before Anderson ran away with the match by taking the final eight legs. The timing of Anderson’s big scores and big finishes – particularly a 157 to stop Wright’s fightback and go 4-3 up – was decisive. “There were some good darts and some terrible ones,” said Anderson, who continued the mantra that has served him so well in this tournament: that he has nothing to lose. “I never thought I’d win two on the trot. My job was done two years ago – winning it for the first time, playing Phil Taylor on the stage. To me that’s Phil Taylor’s stage. That meant everything to me.” Van Gerwen and Anderson beat each other on the way to winning the trophy in 2014 and 2015 respectively but have never met in the final. “We have a lot of respect for each other,” said the Dutchman. “He’s a very good darts player and I probably have to play as well again to beat him. This tournament has been a pleasure for everyone to watch, with high averages and a phenomenal standard. Now we have the dream final.”','https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/02/michael-van-gerwen-raymond-van-barneveld-pdc-world-darts-semi-final','Michael van Gerwen blitzes Raymond van Barneveld to set up dream PDC final',368,'sport'),('commentisfree/2017/jan/02/the-biggest-threat-to-culture-is-not-an-lng-plant-the-real-battle-for-james-price-point','The federal court met in Broome recently to hear from anthropologists in the Bindunbur native title claim, a case in which several Aboriginal groups are claiming ownership over large areas of the Dampier Peninsula, in the Kimberley, Western Australia. The land at stake includes James Price Point, an area close to Broome that had been pegged as the site for the Browse Basin LNG processing plant. The focus of this hearing is a competing claim between the Goolarabooloo family – who were lauded nationally and internationally by environmentalists for opposing the LNG development – and the Jabirr Jabirr people, who were widely pitied and pilloried for coming to an agreement with Woodside and the Western Australian government. The Bindunbur case has been making its way through the courts in various forms for the last 20 years. It comprises separate, and sometimes overlapping, actions by Aboriginal groups known as the Goolarabooloo, Jabirr Jabirr, Ngumbarl, Nimanbur and Nyul Nyul. In order to prove traditional ownership, they have to show that they own the land under traditional laws and customs that pre-date the 1829 British assertion of sovereignty over Western Australia. In 2011 the Jabirr Jabirr had negotiated the Browse LNG land access agreements with Woodside and the Western Australian government. These agreements contained $1.5bn worth of benefits for Kimberley Aboriginal people, who, like almost all Aboriginal groups in Australia, live shorter lives, are less educated, and pass on less wealth to their children than non-Aboriginal Australians. The money was almost entirely slated for land, health, education, job creation, and cultural and language programs. In signing the agreements, the Jabirr Jabirr were portrayed in many quarters as selling their Aboriginality to the highest bidder. Broome environmentalist Louise Middleton, for example, said of them that they knew: nothing of their culture … cashing in on their ignorance ... You have people like me who are gadiya [non Aboriginal] who fight tooth and nail for culture, and you have Indigenous people now who are fighting tooth and nail to sell it. The missing man in the courtroom was the so-called Goolarabooloo “law boss” for James Price Point, Joseph Roe. Roe was at the forefront of the national “No Gas” campaign to stop the LNG plant being built, a campaign that was at its peak between 2011 and 2013. He died in 2014 at the age of 47, soon after Woodside pulled out of the project and the agreements, many saying that his life had been shortened by the stress of his fight. He was posthumously named the Bob Brown Foundation 2014 environmentalist of the year. Brown said that, without Roe, “Woodside ... would by now be wrecking the Kimberley coastline.” Yet Roe was a complicated man. He was not actually opposed to the LNG project – he is on the record supporting it, just not at James Price Point where his family lived. The former deputy premier, Eric Ripper, told me that Roe had offered to drop all opposition to the project if money were paid directly to him and his family. He had a reputation for extreme violence, with a string of convictions for assault. And, as the court heard, it is unlikely that he or the Goolarabooloo will be found to be traditional owners of James Price Point. Goolarabooloo claims to ownership are a fabrication under Aboriginal law, “myth making”, one anthropologist told the court. So why was Roe seen as the key Aboriginal spokesperson for the area? All parties to the case agree that the land traditionally belonged to the Jabirr Jabirr and that the Goolarabooloo only arrived in the area in the 1930s. Joseph Roe’s grandfather Paddy Roe was a Nyikina man from the West Kimberley who said that when he came to Jabirr Jabirr country there were almost no surviving Jabirr Jabirr people to look after it. A few remaining elders gave him the land, he said. Paddy rose to national prominence in the 1980s as an author and activist, and was awarded an Order of Australia medal after he established the “Lurujarri Trail”, a popular multi-day tour around James Price Point in which visitors are taught about Aboriginal culture. The term “Goolarabooloo” is a recent creation, a conflation of several Yawuru words indicating a western coastal people living in or near Yawuru land. Today the group essentially comprises the descendants of Paddy Roe. The Jabirr Jabirr dispute Paddy Roe’s story. They have records from the 1930s that show many Jabirr Jabirr people and multiple births. Today their community comprises hundreds of elders, young people and those that have “been through” Jabirr Jabirr law. They accept that Paddy and Joseph Roe were taught aspects of Jabirr Jabirr law and culture, and that this gave them certain authority. However they dispute that it meant that the Goolarabooloo therefore took over ownership of Jabirr Jabirr land. In court in Broome, the majority of anthropologists appeared to agree with this argument. Giving evidence was one of Australia’s best-regarded anthropologists, Professor Peter Sutton. Sutton told the court that the Goolarabooloo story of how they became owners of the land does not make sense under Aboriginal law. Aboriginal law, Sutton said, says that the law of the land is in the soil and the rocks put down by superhuman beings during the Dreamtime period. It would be possible for someone like Paddy Roe to be adopted by the Jabirr Jabirr people, but he would then have been bound by Jabirr Jabirr law rather than forming his own distinct family with a competing claim. The Goolarabooloo family were “welcomed and tolerated by Jabirr Jabirr, but ... it was the Jabirr Jabirr gift to do so”, Sutton said, and also in Jabirr Jabirr power to withdraw that welcome. That welcome was withdrawn when the Goolarabooloo family sought to portray themselves as the true owners of James Price Point during the “No Gas” campaign. They did this, a senior Jabirr Jabirr woman told me, as part of a Goolarabooloo public relations campaign to take their land. For a time, it was highly effective. Media images of Roe and his family were powerful for the campaign. As a local Broome environmentalist said in 2013: “Goolarabooloo, if you open up that can, what a force.” A Jabirr Jabirr senior man I spoke with was scathing about the levels of adoration that Roe received from a mostly non-Aboriginal audience, saying “the type of person that gets captivated is the same type of person that travels to India to become enlightened.” In Broome, Roe’s prominence in the campaign was controversial, not least because many locals knew his character flaws. A local Broome resident in support of the project said “there is a lot of anger about it because people who know Joe, know that he is not the black Elvis.” Why did the Jabirr Jabirr agree to the development? An important reason is that the government could have compulsorily acquired the land if they didn’t agree. Yet many Jabirr Jabirr wanted the development, believing it could help end cycles of suicides and helplessness. One Jabirr Jabirr traditional owner told me that: Maybe some of [the No Gas protestors] genuinely think that they don’t want the Aboriginal way of life to be destroyed, but it is already being destroyed by alcohol, drugs and violence. If those things are not addressed, the next generation … will not know how to administer culture.&nbsp; There are many misconceptions about culture, and people are manipulating it to suit their own needs. The biggest threat to culture is the dysfunction among us, it is a much bigger threat than any development. This development we could have managed and controlled, and used it to strengthen culture because we would be functioning well, have a job, get healthy, educated. You can then practise culture properly.

The average advertised salary fell to £32,221 in November from £33,118 a year earlier according to Adzuna, the jobs search engine. They were down 1.5% compared with October’s £32,725. The biggest annual drop in advertised salaries was in the retail sector, where the average fell by 17.4% to £21,769. Adzuna said the sharp fall was partly down to a rise in the number of more low-paid temporary jobs . Other sectors to record big pay cuts included consultancy, down 16.4% in the year to November, customer service jobs, down 11.3%, and warehouse jobs, down 10.3%. The number of jobs advertised hit a 12-month high of 1.165m in November – a 0.2% rise compared with October, but 6.4% lower than the same month in 2015. Doug Monro, co-founder of Adzuna, said: “The jobs market has fared well in the main this year, given the unexpected events within the political climate. “Despite total advertised vacancies increasing significantly, it may be too early to brand the jobs market a complete success given salary stagnation and the unpredictability that may lie ahead in the new year.” Economists have warned that 2017 will be a tougher year for consumers and businesses, with lower growth, higher inflation and weak wage growth. Uncertainty is also expected to rise next year as Brexit negotiations begin. “2017 will certainly bring new prospects and challenges for the jobs market and the sooner Brexit plans are confirmed, the sooner businesses and individuals will be able to plan for the future with more certainty,” Munro said. Adzuna said competition for jobs was at an all-time low in November, with 0.43 jobseekers per vacancy. The search engine site said that over 2016, Cambridge was the best place to find a job with more than 10 vacancies to every jobseeker. Sunderland was the toughest, with 3.48 jobseekers for every job advertised. The latest official figures painted a mixed picture of the jobs market in the months following the EU referendum in June. The employment rate fell for the first time in a year and a half in the three months to October, to 74.4% from 74.5% according to the Office for National Statistics.

The overall rise in prices will outstrip the increase in season tickets set by the government, leading unions to accuse private train companies of milking the system. Labour party research shows that season tickets have gone up by an average of 27% since 2010, while the TUC found that rail fares had risen at more than twice the rate of inflation and wages over the last decade. According to Labour, some commuters will now payover £2,000 more to travel to work than when the Conservatives came to power in 2010. A comparison of costs on nearly 200 routes shows that the average commuter is now paying £2,788 for their season ticket, £594 more than in 2010. The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said: “Passengers have faced truly staggering fare rises of over £2,000 since 2010. Fares have risen more than three times faster than wages, and passengers on some routes have also been hit by stealth fare rises of up to 162%.” A Virgin Trains season ticket between Birmingham and London now costs £10,200, up £2,172 since 2010, while commuters travelling from Brighton to London on the troubled Southern Rail route now pay almost £1,000 more than in 2010, Labour’s research found. “Passengers were always told that higher fares were necessary to fund investment, but vital projects have been delayed by years and essential maintenance works have been put on hold,” McDonald said. A less fragmented railway, under public ownership, would have lower costs, he added. The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, took a different view. He said: “We are delivering the biggest rail modernisation programme for more than a century, providing more seats and services. We have always fairly balanced the cost of this investment between the taxpayer and the passenger.” The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train operators and Network Rail, said around 97p in every pound paid by passengers goes back into running and improving services. Its chief executive, Paul Plummer, said: “Nobody wants to pay more to travel to work and at the moment in some places people aren’t getting the service they are paying for.” This year the rise in overall fares, which is set by train companies, outstrip the rise in season tickets and other regulated fares. Fares on Virgin Trains East Coast have risen by 4.9% overall, with the company pushing up the price of some off-peak singles by 7% and the price of a ticket London to Edinburgh up to £137.20. Regulated fares have increased by 1.9% in line with July’s retail price index inflation figure, which is three times higher than the consumer price index (CPI) figure that the government more commonly employs. The Campaign for Better Transport called on the government to use CPI inflation figures to determine fare rises. It also demanded a cap on increases on walk-on fares, and season tickets targeted to equally benefit part-time workers. Lianna Etkind, a spokeswoman for the campaign, said: “With the average cost of an annual season ticket into London now more than £4,000, many people can simply no longer afford to get to work. It’s clear to us, and to millions of passengers up and down the country, that the whole fares and ticketing system needs overhauling.” The TUC’s research shows that rail fares have increased by 56% since 2006, more than double the rise of 24% rise in average earnings and 26% in inflation over the decade. Action for Rail, a campaign by rail unions and the TUC, says the UK’s privatised rail service has increased costs for commuters. It plans protests at more than 100 stations around Britain on Tuesday, when the majority of commuters will return to work after the new year holiday. The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, said: “British commuters are forced to shell out far more on rail fares than others in Europe. Many will look with envy at the cheaper, publicly-owned services on the continent. “Private train companies are milking the system, and the government is letting them get away with it.” A survey for the campaign group We Own It found that around half of respondents believed fares would fall under public ownership. According to polling by Survation, 48% of people believed train travel would be cheaper in a renationalised railway, and 58% said privatisation had been a failure. Cat Hobbs, the director of We Own It, said: “We need an integrated, efficient railway that is accountable to all of us. Profits should be invested for the benefit of passengers, not shareholders.” The rail fare increases come as strikes continue to affect passengers on Southern rail. Services were disrupted and some lines closed by a three-day strike by conductors from the RMT union in a long-running row over reforms to their jobs and duties. The latest strike started on 31 December and concludes on Monday. Southern said a “team of contingency conductors” was keeping key routes open. The most extreme disruption yet in the Southern dispute looms next week, when a a six-day walkout by drivers from 9 January is expected to bring the network to a complete standstill.','https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/jan/02/rail-fares-train-operators-accused-of-milking-the-system-as-rises-kick-in','Rail fares: train operators accused of milking the system as rises kick in',371,'money'),('society/2017/jan/02/fourteen-garden-villages-to-be-built-england-48000-homes-green-belt','Fourteen garden villages are to be built across England on sites including a former airfield and green belt land, ministers have said. The villages, totalling 48,000 homes, will not be extensions of existing small towns or villages, but “distinct new places with their own community facilities”, the government said. Sites from Cornwall to Cumbria have been identified in the first round of approved locations, making them eligible for a share of a £6m government technical and financial support fund. After completion, the villages may vary in size from 1,500 homes up to 10,000. The housing minister, Gavin Barwell, said the development of the villages would be locally led by communities rather than central government. “New communities not only deliver homes, they also bring new jobs and facilities and a big boost to local economies,” he said. The 600-acre former Deenethorpe airfield near Corby, Northamptonshire, is one of the sites that has been approved for a village. The plans include a village green, shops and community hall, as well as more than 1,000 homes. Dunton Hills, a garden village set to be built near Brentwood, Essex, will have at least 2,500 homes, as well as new Gypsy and Traveller pitches. West Carclaze in Cornwall is set to be an ecovillage with 1,500 new energy-efficient homes, space for self-build and custom-built housing, and a new primary school for more than 400 pupils. Developers say it will have a solar farm and 350 hectares of green space in a new china clay heritage park incorporating the Sky Tip, a local landmark. Bike trails and pubs are also planned. However, local councillors have raised concerns about the small percentage of affordable housing and change in character of the historical mining area. Cllr Dick Cole, leader of the Cornish devolution party Mebyon Kernow, who said he had objected to proposals for an ecotown for a decade, said the garden village announcement was no more than window dressing for a controversial project. “The government talks about it being a locally led development, but the reality is that this is only happening because it was a government top-down initiative,” he told the Guardian. “They say it is a brownfield site, but many of the houses are on fields. It has been one of those projects that seems to have a momentum of its own, despite what local people say.” North Cheshire garden village, which will sit on the eastern edge of Handforth, has development plans that include 2,000 homes, a nursery and a care home, as well as architect-designed “one-off” homes. However, locals are worried that a new village of several thousand homes may put pressure on infrastructure such as the congested A34. Other planned villages include Long Marston in Warwickshire, Spitalgate Heath in Lincolnshire, Bailrigg in Lancaster and the Infinity garden village in Derbyshire. The final six are Oxfordshire Cotswold, Culm in Devon, Welborne in Hampshire, Halsnead in Merseyside, Longcross in Surrey and St Cuthberts near Carlisle. The garden village initiative was announced by the then chancellor George Osborne last year. Conditions for building villages or market towns stated that the developments must be “a new discrete settlement and not an extension of an existing town or village”. Shaun Spiers, the chief executive of the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE), said it would carefully examine the proposals to see whether they were locally led and respected the green belt. “Done well with genuine local consent, garden villages and towns can help tackle the housing crisis,” he said. “They can certainly be preferable to what is currently happening in too many parts of the country: poor quality developments plonked on the countryside, in the teeth of local opposition and in defiance of good planning principles.” But areas that absorbed the new garden villages should have guarantees that they would be “protected from speculative planning applications for a long time to come”, he added. The Department for Communities and Local Government said there had been high levels of interest in building more villages in the coming years and it would make an additional £1m available this year to further development other proposals. Three new garden towns have also been announced near Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, Taunton in Somerset and Harlow and Gilston in Hertfordshire, with £1.4m of funding to support the delivery of about 50,000 homes. Local CPRE members strongly object to the Hertfordshire plans, under which the village of Gilston and neighbouring hamlet of Eastwick would disappear. Kevin FitzGerald, the honorary director of CPRE Hertfordshire, said: “These plans herald the death knell of the rural character of whole swaths of Hertfordshire. Beautiful villages, supposedly protected by green belt [designation], look set to be swallowed up by the urban sprawl of neighbouring towns. “Housing targets are putting immense pressure on our area and marginalising the basic purposes of the green belt, which the government has pledged to protect.”','https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/02/fourteen-garden-villages-to-be-built-england-48000-homes-green-belt','Fourteen garden villages to be built in England totalling 48,000 homes',372,'society'),('football/2017/jan/03/arsene-wenger-arsenal-comeback-at-bournemouth','Arsène Wenger hailed his players’ “great resilience and mental strength” after Arsenal scored three times in the final 20 minutes at Bournemouth to complete a remarkable fightback and escape with a point at the end of a thrilling game. Trailing 3-0 and subjected to chants from their supporters mocking their performance as “embarrassing”, Arsenal turned the match on its head when Olivier Giroud headed an injury-time equaliser. It felt like a point gained in the context of what had gone on earlier, yet will ultimately be viewed as two dropped when it comes to the title race. Arsenal are eight points behind Chelsea, who also have a game in hand. Wenger acknowledged his team “suffered defensively” on a night when Ryan Fraser, who scored Bournemouth’s third goal, tormented Héctor Bellerín. The Arsenal manager claimed Bellerín was carrying an injury and once again expressed his annoyance that his team had been asked to play twice in the space of two days while Bournemouth had an additional 24 hours’ rest. Arsenal lost Francis Coquelin with a hamstring injury in the first half and Wenger withdrew Laurent Koscielny in the second half because the defender was suffering with cramp. Bournemouth also inflicted plenty of damage, with the early goals from Charlie Daniels and Callum Wilson seeing the home team race into a deserved two-goal lead. Alexis Sánchez pulled one back for Arsenal in the 70th minute, Lucas Pérez superbly volleyed in their second and Giroud, after Simon Francis had a little harshly received a straight red card for a challenge on Aaron Ramsey, scored the third. “It was a physical test and a mental test for us,” Wenger said. “A physical test because we had problems to start to cope with the pace of Bournemouth. Defensively we had some problems. You have to acknowledge the quality of Bournemouth, congratulations to them. But also it’s too uneven to have only two days to play against a team that had more than three days rest and it took us a while to get back into the game. “On top of that we were a bit unlucky as well, we conceded a penalty, and with 70 minutes played we were 3-0 down, so it was a mental test. But we succeeded because we have a great resilience in the team and great mental strength, and that came out. In the end we were even frustrated not to win the game.” Bournemouth caused Arsenal no end of problems for an hour, in particular through the pace of Wilson, Josh King and Fraser. “We suffered defensively in some positions but they scored four against Liverpool, so they can score goals, it’s a team who is dangerous,” Wenger said. “But defensively we had some weaknesses that were unusual.” Giroud has scored in three successive games. “I said on Sunday that Giroud can score important goals, he has done that again,” Wenger said. “I also think Pérez scored an exceptional goal of pure class. But we have mixed feelings after a game like that. We wanted three points and we got one. But when you are 3-0 down after 70 minutes you take a point.” Eddie Howe was full of praise for his own players, describing them as “exceptional” and admitting they were devastated in the changing room afterwards. He described the decision of the referee, Michael Oliver, to send off Francis as “harsh” but felt the key moment in the match was 12 minutes earlier when Sánchez scored Arsenal’s first goal. “That changed the momentum of the game in a moment when really we looked quite comfortable,” the Bournemouth manager said.','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/03/arsene-wenger-arsenal-comeback-at-bournemouth','Arsène Wenger praises Arsenal’s fighting spirit after comeback at Bournemouth',373,'football');
INSERT INTO `Articles` VALUES ('politics/2017/jan/03/uk-ambassador-to-eu-quits-amid-brexit-row','Britain’s ambassador to the European Union Sir Ivan Rogers dealt a blow to the UK’s Brexit negotiations by quitting and urging his fellow British civil servants in Brussels to assert their independence by challenging “ill-founded arguments and muddled thinking”. Sir Ivan Rogers said, in an email explaining his reasons for his abrupt departure to the UK’s Brussels diplomatic staff at UKRep, that he was leaving now to give time for his successor to take charge of the lengthy negotiations process which starts in March. But he also made it clear that he had been frustrated by politicians who disliked his warnings about the potential pitfalls in the Brexit process. He also revealed that the basic structure of the UK Brexit negotiating team had not yet been resolved, let alone a negotiating strategy. He wrote: “I hope you will continue to challenge ill-founded arguments and muddled thinking and that you will never be afraid to speak the truth to those in power. I hope that you will support each other in those difficult moments where you have to deliver messages that are disagreeable to those who need to hear them.” Rogers has been attacked by Tory sceptics for warning that it may take as long as 10 years for the UK to fully break from the EU. Downing Street insisted at the time that the ambassador had been communicating the views of some European leaders, rather than giving his own assessment. He has also been repeatedly criticised for setting out how other EU leaders view the Brexit process. He wrote to staff: “I hope that you will continue to be interested in the views of others, even where you disagree with them, and in understanding why others act and think in the way that they do.” Rogers also defended the importance of the UK’s civil service knowledge in Brussels in his resignation email, saying: “In any negotiation which addresses the new relationship, the technical expertise, the detailed knowledge of positions on the other side of the table – and the reasons for them, and the divisions amongst them – and the negotiating experience and savvy that the people in this building bring, make it essential for all parts of UKRep to be centrally involved in the negotiations if the UK is to achieve the best possible outcomes.” Implying that civil servants or politicians in London were trying to take over the Brexit talks, and the structure of the UK negotiating team needs “rapid resolution”, he said “multilateral negotiating experience is in short supply in Whitehall, and that is not the case in the [European] Commission or in the Council”. He said “senior ministers, who will decide on our positions, issue by issue, also need from you detailed, unvarnished – even where this is uncomfortable – and nuanced understanding of the views, interests and incentives of the other 27”. Rogers’ departure so close to the start of Brexit negotiations amounted to a “wilful and total destruction of EU expertise”, according to the former top civil servant at the Treasury. In an unusually candid intervention, Lord Macpherson, who was permanent secretary from 2005 until last year, said Rogers’ decision was a huge loss and that he was the latest in a string of EU experts to be frozen out, describing the decision as “amateurish”. Macpherson also cited Rogers’ predecessor Jon Cunliffe and Tom Scholar, previously the prime minister’s adviser on European issues who is now permanent secretary at the Treasury. His warning appears to reflect a Treasury concern that Theresa May is under pressure from Tory Eurosceptics to abandon hopes of trying to negotiate access to the profitable EU single market, even on a temporary basis. There have been disputes across Whitehall about whether the UK can afford a so-called hard Brexit. The Foreign Office played down the implications of the resignation, saying Rogers had been due to leave in November and that he had merely “resigned a few months early”. “Sir Ivan has taken this decision now to enable a successor to be appointed before the UK invokes article 50 by the end of March,” a spokeswoman said. But Rogers has known since October that he was due to leave his Brussels post before the talks are due to end in 2019, raising questions about why he was given a vital role in preparing for the negotiations in the first place. A Whitehall source said the early departure had been discussed before Rogers told his staff on Tuesday. However, Nick Clegg, who worked with Rogers in Brussels, said it appeared to be the latest in a series of attacks on public officials who had expressed caution about Brexit. “First it was the judges, condemned as enemies of the people for just doing their jobs,” the former deputy prime minister told the Guardian. “It’s been the CBI and any business that didn’t sign up to the Brexit zeal, and now it’s senior officials being kneecapped in the Brexit press, after Sir Ivan Rogers just gave candid advice about the length of time negotiations might take. They are in the firing line if they do not endorse a zealous world view. This is a very worrying trend, and very new in British politics.” Insisting civil service neutrality is a precious British asset, Clegg said the government should value candid advice. “It will come back to haunt the Brexit headbangers, because you can insist as much and hysterically as you like that the world is flat, but there are only so many people you can condemn for just pointing out the truth, that the world is round and that Brexit is complicated, might take time and might not be fully to Britain’s advantage,” he said. George Osborne, the former chancellor, tweeted praising Rogers for his work with him during meetings of EU finance ministers, saying: “He is a perceptive, pragmatic and patriotic public servant.” Responding to Rogers’ resignation email, Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said: “It is damning when our own top people are slamming this Conservative Brexit government for using ill-founded arguments and muddled thinking. “This is the biggest decision by the UK government in modern times and Theresa May is marching ahead without a plan or even a clue. “We need our top people around the table if we are going to avoid wrecking the country with Brexit. It is shameful that vital, talented people like Ivan Rogers are instead being driven away.” The Lib Dems added that it was astonishing that Rogers’ email revealed that, at this late stage in the build-up to the talks, Rogers thought that the UK had no agreed negotiating structure and, in his view, still lacked the required multilateral negotiating expertise available to the European commission. Rogers’ remarks may reflect unresolved tensions between the UK’s Brussels diplomats and the government’s Brexit department, led by David Davis. With the choice of Rogers’ successor bound to be seen as a signal of the direction of UK Brexit policy, Eurosceptics demanded that an enthusiastic Brexiter replace him and called for an ideological purge of officials in the Foreign Office. Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, said: “No organisation has done more to give away our democratic rights than the Foreign Office. They’ve been doing it for decades and I very much hope that Sir Ivan is the first of many to go.” John Redwood, a longtime Eurosceptic Tory MP, said: “Sir Ivan’s heart was not in the negotiations. The talks do not need to be that complicated. If you leave, you leave. You take control of your borders, your laws and your money and that is not something that needs to be negotiated with Mrs Merkel.” Rogers, who was appointed by David Cameron to represent the UK in Brussels, had endured a difficult relationship with Downing Street special advisers during the negotiations before the EU referendum. Some Conservatives blamed him for under-pitching what could be achieved and for advising against taking a harder line. One adviser said: “It was not about him being a Europhile but about being difficult. He not only said the UK did not understand the EU, but [that] the EU did not understand the UK. He was just the most out front of the civil servants – but many others thought like him.” Sources said the two main points of tension were over whether it was feasible for the UK to threaten to drop out of the EU without a deal, falling back on World Trade Organisation terms and how to persuade the EU to negotiate simultaneously on the UK’s divorce terms and a future UK-EU relationship. May has to set out her negotiation strategy to MPs in March but has so far given next to nothing away. Dominic Raab, a Conservative MP and a member of the select committee on exiting the European Union (EEU), said it would have been more disruptive if Rogers had left in November. “Sir Ivan is a distinguished diplomat with a long record of public service,” he said. “He didn’t exactly hide the fact that his heart wasn’t in Brexit and he was due to step down in the autumn anyway. It makes sense all round to give the ambassador who will see the negotiations through some lead time.” However, Labour’s Hilary Benn, who chairs the EEU committee, told the BBC the resignation was “not a good thing” and the government would be under pressure to get a replacement up to speed to meet Theresa May’s timetable for triggering article 50. “I think that it means that the government will have to get its skates on to make sure there is a replacement in place so he or she can work with Sir Ivan in the transition, the handover,” said the former shadow foreign secretary. Peter Mandelson, the former Labour cabinet minister and EU commissioner, said Rogers’ experience was “second to none in Whitehall” and a serious loss for the UK negotiating team. “I would not expect him to comment further but everyone knows that civil servants are being increasingly inhibited in offering objective opinions and advice.”','https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/03/uk-ambassador-to-eu-quits-amid-brexit-row','Ambassador to EU quits and warns staff over \'muddled thinking\'',374,'politics'),('australia-news/2017/jan/04/drownings-spark-calls-for-subsidised-mandatory-swimming-lessons-for-children','The YMCA has called for mandatory and government-subsidised swimming lessons for children after a horror holiday period for drownings in NSW. New South Wales has now had 18 drowning deaths since Christmas Day, while a two-year-old boy remained in intensive care on Tuesday after being pulled from a fish pond at a Sydney home on Monday. A two-year-old girl died on Sunday night after she was found unconscious in a backyard pool in Sydney’s south-west, while a body, believed to be 14-year-old Tui Gallaher, was found at Sydney’s Maroubra beach last week. Writing in Fairfax Media on Wednesday, YMCA NSW chief executive officer, Leisa Hart, said the “unprecedented” number of holiday drownings should be a wake-up call to the federal government. Hart said it is thought three out of five Australian children currently leave primary school without basic swimming skills. She criticised the lack of mandatory swimming lessons and the absence of any “nationally recognised or mandated programs for children under four”. “Just as we teach children to walk, talk, to learn their ABCs and basic maths, we need to educate them about water and its dangers, from backyard pool risks through to how to avoid rips in the ocean,” Hart wrote. “This could begin as early as daycare, with accredited agencies being funded to provide children aged one to four with specialty education about water familiarisation and general water safety – including teaching toddlers how to ‘swim to the side to stay alive’.” Hart called on the government to offer swimming lesson rebates to help reduce the financial burden, which can reach up to $300 per term. She said lessons should then be made mandatory for primary school-aged children. Water safety advocate and former Olympic swimming coach, Laurie Lawrence, said the Kids Alive campaign he had championed for children under the age of five had been successful. “We’ve seen the under-five drownings go from 63 down to 21 last year, which is fantastic,” Lawrence told the ABC. “But the overall drownings seem to be going up and I don’t know if it’s older people, if it’s young men being more brave around water.” Lawrence suggested children may be failing to continue swimming and water safety education once they have basic skills. He said Tasmania now remained the only state in Australia to give free swimming lessons to children until they can swim 50m. “They’re really leading the way at the moment,” he said. On Tuesday, NSW emergency services minister, David Elliott, called on swimmers to be responsible for their own safety and stay out of dangerous water. Elliott said he was appalled at the amount of deaths during the holiday period. “If you don’t know that your fence is childproof, fix it,” Elliott said. “If you don’t know that a river is going to be running a current underneath it, don’t go into it. If you don’t know that a surf is safe, don’t enter the surf. The appeal today is to make sure that you take responsibility for your own safety and the safety of your friends.”','https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jan/04/drownings-spark-calls-for-subsidised-mandatory-swimming-lessons-for-children','Drownings spark calls for subsidised, mandatory swimming lessons for children',375,'australia-news'),('us-news/live/2017/jan/03/congress-is-back-paul-ryan-trump-gm','Swearing-in ceremonies were held as members of the 115th Congress arrived on Capitol Hill, with vice-president Joe Biden and House speaker Paul Ryan doing the honors.

The lawsuit, filed in Santa Clara superior county court, relates to an incident that took place on Christmas Eve 2014, when a driver allegedly using the FaceTime video chat application on his iPhone 6 Plus drove into the car of Bethany and James Modisette. The couple, along with their daughters Isabella and Moriah, were injured in the accident, and Moriah later died in the hospital from her injuries. In their complaint, highlighted by Courthouse News, the Modisettes claim that Apple should be held accountable for the accident because the smartphone manufacturer had a patent for a safer version of FaceTime designed to prevent people from using the video and voice call application while driving. Despite filing the patent, Apple chose not to introduce the technology to its iPhones. The patent in question, granted in April 2014, describes a lock-out mechanism that disables the mobile device from performing certain functions, such as texting, while driving. The Modisettes allege that Apple’s failure to introduce the patented feature, or warn users that using FaceTime while driving could be dangerous, was a “substantial factor” in causing their injuries and Moriah’s death. The case is not the first of its kind. Earlier this year, while checking her iPhone for messages, Ashley Kubiak crashed her truck into another vehicle in Texas, killing its driver and leaving a child paralyzed. The families of the victims also filed a case against Apple, contending the company knew its phones would be used for texting and did not prevent Kubiak from texting dangerously. Kubiak was convicted of negligent homicide and sentenced to five years on probation. “Plaintiffs are saying to manufacturers: if your product unnecessarily diverts the driver’s attention away from the road in the moment before a collision, you may be on the hook,” said Nora Freeman Engstrom, a Stanford law professor. “If the plaintiffs were to prevail, the case could have sweeping implications, not just for handheld devices, but for navigation systems, car radios – potentially even fast food purchased at drive-through windows.” However, it will be difficult for the plaintiffs to show that it was the iPhone that caused the accident when there is another actor – the distracted driver – who could be labelled as a “superseding cause”. “A superseding cause breaks the causal chain, and here would relieve the iPhone manufacturer of liability,” Engstrom said. A complicating factor in both of these cases is that the accidents took place in Texas, where it’s mostly legal for drivers to make phone calls while driving and there’s no state-wide ban on texting while driving, although many cities have outlawed the practice. “Ordinarily if a manufacturer is being sued for an illegal use of their product, they shouldn’t be liable,” said Eric Goldman, a professor at Santa Clara University school of law. However, if the company knew that its devices could be used illegally and had a way to prevent it, there may be grounds for liability – although such liability would hinge on whether the technical solution (in this case, the patented lock-out feature) was feasible. “There’s currently no way to determine whether or not the person using the phone is driving. They could be the passenger,” said patent lawyer Mark Terry. “I don’t think they have a sound legal premise. “A tragedy has happened and they are looking for a deep pocket. Apple has a deep pocket so if anyone can find a reason to hit them at all, they will,” he added. Goldman agrees. “This is what personal injury lawyers do,” he said. “They sue not only the person who caused the harm – the driver – and then everyone else they can think of who might have contributed to the accident.” That’s not to say that cases like these won’t cause problems for device manufacturers in the future. “The patent proves that Apple knows, and has long known, that phone use and driving is widespread and is dangerous,” Engstrom said. “Apple’s inaction in the face of that knowledge may not trigger liability here. But it may well expose Apple to liability down the road.” Apple did not respond to a request for comment.','https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/03/apple-lawsuit-facetime-car-crash-iphone-patent','Apple sued for not adding safety fix to prevent use of FaceTime while driving',377,'technology'),('film/2017/jan/03/woody-harrelson-han-solo-prequel-star-wars','Woody Harrelson is in talks to join the Han Solo spinoff movie.

Several times in this campaign Mauricio Pochettino has deplored his team’s lack of ruthlessness but during the season of goodwill his players summoned the callousness he demanded, scoring eight goals in two away matches after Christmas on top of the five in the two games before. Spurs’ most dangerous attackers, Harry Kane and Dele Alli, are in their best form. Now Tottenham must show they have the sangfroid to be merciless against the meanest defence in the Premier League. They cannot afford to be as forgiving as they were at Stamford Bridge in November, when they had Chelsea on the ropes several times but failed to land enough punches to knock them down and were beaten 2-1. A similar result would leave Pochettino’s men 13 points behind Antonio Conte’s side, whereas victory would keep them within striking distance. “If we review the game from November, we deserved more,” Pochettino said. “We dominated and we created more chances than them but you always need to be more clinical. In the last few games we have scored a lot, so it will be a great game. We are excited.” The excitement is widespread. All the other title chasers yearn for more evidence the leaders are stoppable and no one craves an end to Chelsea’s winning run more than Tottenham fans, even though curtailing it at 13 matches would leave Arsenal as the holders of the record for consecutive Premier League victories. It was Chelsea who quashed Spurs’ lingering title hopes last season by fighting back in a tempestuous battle to gain a 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge. And the 2-1 victory for Conte’s side at the same venue this season put paid to Tottenham’s unbeaten start. For Tottenham fans, revenge is a dish best served white-hot. The atmosphere on Wednesday will enhance the spectacle but make it all the harder for players to keep their heads. That is why Pochettino, without trying to dilute the appeal of a derby, is urging his players, publicly at least, not to get caught up in talk of revenge. “Always Chelsea and Arsenal are our enemies and it is true for our fans it is a very special game but, as we are professionals, the most important thing is to think about three points,” he said. “It is in our head to win the game and close the gap but not for revenge for last season. That chapter is closed. If we need to blame someone [for last season], we need to blame ourselves – we are the guilty ones that did not achieve the Premier League.” Which brings us back to their inconsistent finishing – and their jitters. At crucial times last season Spurs’ sureness in front of goal abandoned them, much as their nerve did at Old Trafford three weeks ago. That servile 1-0 defeat by Manchester United is another reason why Tottenham need to beat Chelsea before belief will grow that their recent run could really turn into a title charge. In addition to the form of Kane and Alli, who between them have scored eight goals in their past three matches and were taken off long before the end of Sunday’s win at Watford in an effort to keep them at peak sharpness for Wednesday, there are other encouraging pointers for Spurs. Toby Alderweireld was commanding at Watford on his return from a two-week layoff and Danny Rose is in storming form. Both of those defenders missed the match at Stamford Bridge in November and their availability should make Spurs stronger. Pochettino almost has a full-strength squad from which to choose, with only Érik Lamela injured. The Spurs manager also has interesting tactical options. At Watford, as against Arsenal earlier in the season, he deployed a back three and his team were again solid enough to suggest they may not be destabilised if Pochettino chooses to move closer to the shape that has worked so well for Chelsea over the past three months. Amid doubts about the fitness of Chelsea’s Marcos Alonso, Rose and Kyle Walker could establish wing-back supremacy for Spurs. That is only one of many intriguing prospects in a battle laden with significance and high-class match-ups. Tottenham showed in November they have the vibrancy to overwhelm the leaders but they must demonstrate that even when push comes to shove they also have the coolness to turn pressure into goals. If they do that they could offer their fans a treat in the same vein as the 5-3 victory they enjoyed on New Year’s Day 2015, Pochettino’s only win over Chelsea since taking charge of Spurs. A formidable test looms for both teams and, if Tottenham pass it, the title race will become tighter for six sides.','https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/jan/03/tottenham-gloss-finish-chelsea-leaders-premier-league','Tottenham must put gloss on their finishing against leaders Chelsea',379,'football'),('football/2017/jan/03/chelsea-fixtures-antonio-conte-premier-league-tottenham','Antonio Conte has dismissed the gripes of rival Premier League managers over the scheduling of Chelsea’s Christmas and new year fixtures, suggesting they are annoyed only at his club’s position at the top of the table. Chelsea, who have a five‑point lead after a run of 13 consecutive league wins, are at Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday for their third match of the festive period. Those games will have been spread over 10 days, making it the most favourable programme, in terms of rest periods, of the division. Southampton were the hardest hit, with their three matches crammed in over six days while, of the top six, Liverpool had the tightest schedule, with three games in seven days. Jürgen Klopp, Arsène Wenger and José Mourinho, the managers of Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United, have each complained about the scheduling, with Mourinho saying Chelsea and Tottenham had been granted a “privilege” in playing on Wednesday after all of the other clubs. “I can reply that I didn’t do the fixtures,” Conte said. “I think that’s the simple reply. “The advantage we have is one more day of rest over Tottenham [since the weekend matches]. That’s the advantage if we want to speak about advantage. But for me, the advantages are other things – during a season, different situations can happen when you can have advantages – but, for sure, not this. “I think they [the rival managers] are angry for our position, not for the fixtures. I’m not disappointed. I think it’s normal. This also happens in Italy. I repeat – it’s always because you stay up [at the top].” Conte also noted how Chelsea had played three games in seven days in the run-up to Christmas – against West Bromwich Albion, Sunderland and Crystal Palace – and, before the Spurs game, he sought to turn the focus inwards and not worry about being up there to be shot at. If Chelsea were to defeat Tottenham, they would equal Arsenal’s top‑flight record in English football for consecutive wins. “It’s logical to arrive at this sort of situation when you stay up because, at the start of the season, no one could imagine this,” Conte said. “It’s important that we continue in the same way – to think about ourselves and not look at the other teams and other situations.”','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/03/chelsea-fixtures-antonio-conte-premier-league-tottenham','Chelsea’s rivals are jealous of our lead not our fixtures, says Antonio Conte',380,'football'),('football/2017/jan/03/antonio-conte-chelsea-tottenham-winning-run','When Antonio Conte thought about what to name his daughter, he wanted something beautiful and also something that would resonate with him. In the end, there was only one choice. He and his wife, Elisabetta, called her Vittoria, which translates from the Italian as Victory. “This name is nice and it’s an important name – above all, in England,” the Chelsea manager said, with a smile. “My wife is Elizabeth, so I have two English queens! It was because I knew one day I would arrive here in England to work. I wanted this name for my daughter. I like the name and then, I like the word [and its meaning].” Conte has been obsessed by winning since long before Vittoria came along – she is now nine – and he has spoken of how he struggles to sleep on the night before a match, such is the sense of anticipation, and how he finds it even more difficult the night afterwards if his team have not won. It is easy to present Conte as a restless soul, one who can never work hard enough and for whom victory is the only thing that sates him; which makes it all feel worthwhile. The temptation would be to say he ought to be pretty content, because his team stand on the brink of equalling the top-division record in English football for consecutive wins. If Chelsea beat Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on Wednesday night, they will extend their sequence to 14 games, which Arsenal managed in 2002. But that run was spread over two seasons – with 13 having come at the end of 2001-02 and one more at the beginning of the following campaign. Conte, though, does not do contentedness; at least, not halfway through a season. He is pleased Chelsea have won 13 on the spin to put themselves clear at the top and he also made the point that “at the start of the season, no one could imagine this”. But what stuck in the mind from Conte’s briefing with the media was how he saw the wins mainly for the points they have provided. “This is a great achievement – above all because now, after these 13 wins in a row, we took 39 points,” Conte said. And what do points make? Yes. Surprise championship triumphs. It was equally noticeable that Conte stressed how Liverpool were only five points adrift in second place and it was plain he was not about to get carried away by the prospect of equalling Arsenal’s winning record or even overhauling it for a single top‑flight&nbsp;season. Conte did attempt to quantify what Chelsea had achieved with their sequence and he did so in the context of what is a hugely competitive six-way fight for the title. In his final season at Juventus, which was 2013-14, Conte’s team won 12 successive fixtures in Serie A from late October to late January but, he suggested, there were more easy games in that division. Juventus ended up winning the championship with a record 102 points. “In that moment, in the Italian league, there was only Roma to try to fight for the title,” Conte said. “Here, there is a different situation because there are six teams that are very strong. Last season, all of our rivals were placed above us and, also, they spent a lot of money – more than us. For this reason, I think it’s more difficult here in England to keep this position.” Conte’s claim that the other members of the top six had spent more than Chelsea last summer did not bear scrutiny. It was only the Manchester clubs that did so, in terms of fees and net spend. However, he was on safer ground when he talked up the factors behind his club’s excellent first half to the season, which included his players’ willingness to embrace the change of formation to three at the back and the bravery of some – notably David Luiz – to play on through the pain of injuries. The centre-half, according to Conte, has been “playing in this situation” since the win at City on 3&nbsp;December, when he was the victim of a high, red-card tackle by Sergio Agüero. Conte’s team have also beaten Manchester United and Tottenham at Stamford Bridge during the run but it sounded as if he considered the visit to White Hart Lane as the acid test. He described Spurs as being “better” and “stronger” than they were last season, partly because what is a young team have had more time under Mauricio Pochettino. It was interesting to hear him single out the defensive midfielder Victor Wanyama for praise. “This season, there is a very important player for Pochettino, who is Wanyama,” Conte said. “I like his quality and quantity – in terms of his stamina, work rate and commitment.” Conte said Pochettino could be “one of the best coaches in the world” and he discussed the similarities in their approaches, which took in the desire to build from the back with options, prepare in meticulous fashion and be clinical. A tantalising showdown beckons. For Conte, as ever, victory will be everything.','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/03/antonio-conte-chelsea-tottenham-winning-run','Antonio Conte can see the bigger picture even if Chelsea’s winning run falls short',381,'football'),('world/2017/jan/03/canada-ceo-pay-2017-earnings-average-worker','Minutes before lunchtime on the first working day of the year, Canada’s 100 highest paid chief executive officers had already earned more than the average Canadian will earn in all of 2017, according to a new report. CEO earnings in Canada – which rank among the highest in the world relative to the average worker – have soared to record levels in recent years, with the top 100 CEOs taking home an average of C$9.5m ($7m) in 2015, an analysis by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, an Ottawa-based thinktank, showed. Their compensation is now 193 times that of the average industrial wage in the country. “Sadly, I’m not really surprised by the findings at all,” said Hugh Mackenzie, the author of the report. The executives’ pay has proven to be resilient, growing some 7% over 2014 figures even as the Canadian economy shrank. The findings offer a window into growing income inequality in the country, said Mackenzie. In 1995, the thinktank tracked 50 of Canada’s highest-paid CEOs and found they made around 85 times the average income. By 2015, this same cohort was making 290 times the average Canadian income of C$49,510. “Not only are these high incomes, but they are incomes that demonstrably have grown significantly relative to the incomes of average people.” When adjusted for inflation, the average income of the top 100 CEO’s has grown by 99% since 1998, compared to 9% for the average Canadian. Research suggests there is little link between the soaring earnings and better company performance. Instead Mackenzie pointed to stock market-based forms of compensation, arguing that they keep executives transfixed on what is happening to their bottom line in the short term and encourage moves such as mass layoffs to boost shares of the company. “I think its fair to say that we are collectively paying the price for the short-term focus of corporate decision-making,” said Mackenzie. “We just have a fundamentally broken system for establishing executive compensation.” The thinktank, which has tracked CEO compensation in Canada for the past decade, used information from companies listed on the Toronto stock exchange to compile the report. Earnings reflect compensation that ranges from base pay to bonuses as well as grants of shares and stock options. Just two women made the list. The 100 listed include five named Mark or Marc and another five named Michael. “It’s a very clubby, white Anglo-Saxon Protestant male world,” said Mackenzie. “It doesn’t look like Canadian society at all.” At the top of the list sits Michael Pearson of Valeant Pharmaceuticals, who in 2015 earned C$182m – nearly seven times that of the next CEO on the list. “Pretty much every year there’s a few people who are sticking out at the top end,” said Mackenzie. Recently the company has been plagued by a series of problems, from accounting issues to reports of a probe by US prosecutors. Pearson stepped down in early 2016. Data from the OECD regularly suggests that Canada, along with the US and Britain, rank among the countries with the most extreme gap between CEO’s and the average worker. Many in Canada point to the US – where the gap is most extreme, with the top 500 CEOs earning 340 times the average worker’s wage – and fears over brain drain to explain the pressure to ensure executives are well remunerated. Mackenzie, however, said research suggests it is relatively rare for executives to cross the Canada-US border in search of jobs.','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/03/canada-ceo-pay-2017-earnings-average-worker','Top Canada CEOs have already earned more than average worker\'s 2017 salary',382,'world'),('football/2017/jan/03/crystal-palace-swansea-city-premier-league-match-report','Alan Curtis has been a dependable redoubt throughout Swansea City’s time in the Premier League. Before stepping aside for the new manager, Paul Clement, he did his club proud once again as he steered them to victory against Crystal Palace. Curtis’s last match as the caretaker-manager brought a performance that belied Swansea’s position and their recent wretched form. Joined by Clement in the dugout for the second half, he also made two decisive substitutions to win the game when Àngel Rangel converted Leroy Fer’s long ball with two minutes left. It was a vital three points and confirmed Sam Allardyce has another big job on his hands at Palace. “You’ll have to excuse the voice, a bit of excitement at the end there,” said Curtis before confirming it was he who had called the shots in the game’s final knockings. “I made the substitutes. There were injuries and players who had been suffering so the changes all sort of fell into place to be fair. Paul came down, he made a real positive contribution. There’s nothing better for any player than having a new manager watching them.” The home side were being watched by a febrile crowd, with the mood in Selhurst Park worse than in the last days of Alan Pardew’s regime. Whether the atmosphere fed into Palace’s play or not, nerves were already manifest and the home side started terribly. Swansea had a focus about their approach and confidence on the ball. Palace were either overplaying or short of ideas. Allardyce put this down to fatigue after he chose to select a largely similar side to the one who lost to Arsenal two days previously. He also accepted his players had not performed well enough but saved his strongest words for the referee, Paul Tierney, after he failed to give Palace a penalty in the 32nd minute. A Wayne Hennessey goal-kick had somehow managed to clear the entire Swansea defence and fell to Christian Benteke who got a touch beyond the onrushing Lukasz Fabianski. The Belgian then went over the keeper and went to ground. Tierney saw no foul and video replays were not conclusive but Allardyce was incensed with the decision. “The goalie’s cleaned him out,” Allardyce said. “I can’t understand why the ref didn’t give the penalty but maybe I can because he has had very few games in the Premier League and might find it hard to make the big judgments. He got it wrong and he got it massively wrong. If we’d have scored that penalty I don’t think we would have lost that game.” Swansea took the lead just before half-time with a set piece Big Sam would have been proud of. It came from a typically expert delivery from Gylfi Sigurdsson, which was matched by the run from Alfie Mawson. The 22-year-old centre-half, signed from Barnsley in the summer, ran across the Palace line to flick the ball back from where he had come and inside the near post. It was his first goal for the club. The crowd booed Palace off vociferously at half-time and then cheered them vigorously back on. Allardyce withdrew Benteke, who had hurt his shoulder falling over, and replaced him with Fraizer Campbell. He also added Bakary Sako for Andros Townsend and suddenly Palace had more zip, even if they struggled to create good chances. In the 78th minute Sako provoked another penalty shout, bustling his way into the box and flicking the ball past Rangel only for the Spaniard to stop it with his hand. This one was a definite penalty but Tierney could not have seen it because his whistle stayed silent. For a moment it looked as if Palace had burned themselves out. Swansea were recovering their composure. But then in the 84th minute a moment of quality from Wilfried Zaha brought the scores level. Campbell chased down a long ball and played it wide to Martin Kelly. His first-time cross span across the edge of the box, where Zaha met it with a flying scissor kick. Fabianski could do nothing as it flew past him into the net. There was bedlam in the ground but still there was time for another twist as Rangel chose the end of the match to turn auxiliary striker. Running on to Fer’s long ball, he took one touch to control and another to finish coolly under Hennessey. Suddenly it was a figurative six-pointer after all. Clement will now take full charge and Curtis says the former assistant to Carlo Ancelotti believes he can keep Swansea up. “I think that’s why he took the job,” Curtis said. “He had the security of a top job at Bayern Munich but he wanted the challenge. I told him if I was him I would have stayed in Germany.”','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/03/crystal-palace-swansea-city-premier-league-match-report','Swansea’s Àngel Rangel sinks Crystal Palace to give Paul Clement hope',383,'football'),('football/2017/jan/03/stoke-city-watford-premier-league-match-report','Walter Mazzarri admitted Watford are in a state of “total emergency” as his injury‑stricken team fell to their sixth defeat in eight games. Goals from Ryan Shawcross and Peter Crouch enabled Stoke City to cruise to their second victory in six weeks against opponents bedevilled by injuries to at least nine players. Mazzarri does not fear for his job as Watford’s manager because he claims there is a consensus at the club to build for the future. Mid-table momentum can be everything at this stage of the Premier League season and while Stoke won for the first time in a month, a fifth successive away defeat continued Watford’s alarming nosedive. “I don’t feel under pressure, because I speak with our owner [Gino Pozzo] every day,” Mazzarri said. “We know our objectives and we are not here just looking at the next five or six matches, we are looking together for the next three years. With the injuries we have, in the Premier League these results can happen. Now we look for solutions.” Watford may have put in a much more concerted effort than in the humiliation at home against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday but the points count was the same at a club where managerial security is seldom held sacred. Mazzarri, Watford’s eighth manager in four and a half years, arrived at Vicarage Road on a three-year deal in the summer. He admitted it was a gamble to recall Valon Behrami from a hamstring injury against Stoke but said: “Because of the total emergency we are in, I took responsibility to make Behrami play.” Watford have been linked with an £8m bid for Brentford’s free-scoring striker Will Hogan and they are also believed to be interested in signing Henri Lansbury, the Nottingham Forest playmaker. Mazzarri said: “The problem is the January transfer market is not very easy. In 15 years, I have not had the injuries in one season we have now but we still have the quality to recover.” Even though Stoke started a point worse off than Watford and without a win in five matches, their approach reflected far better spirits. At least they had performed well in losing at Chelsea and Liverpool. The Watford players certainly appeared to give their all for Mazzarri but he still left the field shaking his head and clasping his hands together as if in prayer at half-time. For with virtually the last kick of the half, Shawcross half-volleyed home as he ran unmarked on to Charlie Adam’s corner. It was the Stoke captain’s first goal for almost exactly two years. Watford went for broke after half-time, introducing a second striker in Odion Ighalo for Behrami and almost immediately Abdoulaye Doucouré forced Lee Grant into a superb diving save. Within four minutes Crouch, having scored in the 4-2 defeat at Chelsea on Saturday, claimed his 98th Premier League goal when Sebastian Prödl totally missed Adam’s cross. Crouch should have scored again 15 minutes from time but almost comically mistimed Ibrahim Afellay’s cross for the ball to fall to square to Jon Walters, who also failed to convert. Prödl headed wide in a burst of Watford pressure late on, but Walters and Shawcross both went close as Stoke saw out the game comfortably. Grant should convert his loan move from Derby County into a permanent deal, for a fee of around £2m, once the goalkeeper has tied “up a few loose ends at the Derby end” while Stoke are looking to take up a one-year option to extend Crouch’s contract at the end of this season. “We are speaking about it,” Mark Hughes said. “We’ve got the option to do that. This is my fourth season here and I haven’t seen any diminishing of his powers.” The Stoke manager added: “He’s not just in the squad because he’s a good guy. He’s great, got no ego and while he’s been frustrated and knocking on my door asking why he’s not been in the team, I’ve reassured him he’s an important part of what we’re doing here. He’s hoping he can get his century. Very few British strikers have scored 100 Premier League goals and he deserves to. He’s been a top striker.”','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/03/stoke-city-watford-premier-league-match-report','Stoke’s Peter Crouch strikes again to give Watford the cold shoulder',384,'football'),('sport/2017/jan/03/england-eddie-jones-six-nations-injured-stars','With the Six Nations Championship just a month away England are in danger of kicking off the tournament lacking more than half their starting pack. Eddie Jones, the England head coach, has confirmed Wasps’ Joe Launchbury will miss the start of the championship with the Vunipola brothers, Chris Robshaw and George Kruis also at risk of missing the opening fixture against France on 4&nbsp;February. Given the suspended Dylan Hartley will be seriously short of match practice before the France game at Twickenham, Jones may yet have to oversee a major forward reshuffle, particularly if Robshaw and Kruis are absent. Robshaw has aggravated a shoulder joint injury, Kruis is recovering from a fractured cheekbone and Launchbury has a strained calf. With James Haskell still awaiting his Premiership comeback, only Dan Cole and Maro Itoje from Jones’s series-winning pack in Australia last summer are injury-free. England are fortunate to have plenty of depth in most positions but should Cole or Itoje pick up a knock this month the pool of England forward talent really will be tested. “People say relax and enjoy the job,” said Jones, who has been presiding over a twoday squad gathering in Brighton. “You never relax. Every day you wake up you’re hoping someone else doesn’t get injured.” Typically, though, Jones is busily making contingency plans. He is keen to try Itoje in the back row in the not too distant future and will also have no qualms about rushing Hartley back into his team if the Northampton hooker proves his fitness during England’s pre‑Six&nbsp;Nations training camp in Portugal. “He’s got to come in to Portugal fit and ready to go,” Jones said of Hartley. “He’s doing all the right things at the moment and, if he keeps on doing that, there’s no reason why he won’t be starting hooker and captain. He is on a stringent fitness programme now ... he ate turkey and broccoli for Christmas dinner! He’s got to train bloody hard ... if he does, he’s going to put himself in a great position to be in the 23. If he’s in the 23, he’ll be captain.” With so much other uncertainty swishing around there are obvious reasons why Jones would prefer Hartley to lead his team out against France, regardless of the fact his senior hooker will have played just 128 minutes of Premiership rugby in 2016‑17 by the end of January. Saracens, at least, remain optimistic that Kruis will be fit in February but the outcome of a scan on Robshaw’s shoulder problem has yet to be disclosed. “Chris is a massive ‘glue’ player who does the unseen work,” said Jones, fresh from a seasonal break in his native Australia. “He is a really strong, consistent player and is a massive leader for us in an informal sense.” Whoever plays, the squad have already been warned that easing gently into the Six Nations Championship is not an option. Jones has seen what has happened to Leicester City, English football’s dominant side in 2016, and does not want to see a similar decline from a team who finished last year with a 100% Test record. “We addressed it at the first meeting,” Jones said. “We went through the example of what’s happened to Leicester and do we want that to happen to us? We’ve come up with some strategies we believe will help us overcome any complacency and keep pushing forward. “You don’t defend a Grand Slam, you’ve got to win it again. That’s why we’ve got to be absolutely daring going into this Six Nations. We want to be a side that has the courage to play our sort of rugby from the very first game of the tournament. We want to create more attacking threats and be more creative. How we’re going to do that is going to be ‘The England Way’. We’ll get better at how we do it.” Jones has also emphasised the revised tackle laws to his players, with sanctions for high ‘hits’ set to increase from this week onwards: “There is going to be a period where red and yellow are going to be very popular colours and you’ve just got to be able to cope with that.”','https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/03/england-eddie-jones-six-nations-injured-stars','Eddie Jones draws up Six Nations plans to cover for injured England stars',385,'sport'),('football/2017/jan/03/bournemouth-arsenal-premier-league-match-report','Forget all the talk about Olivier Giroud’s scorpion kick – the real sting in the tail was delivered by the Frenchman 48 hours later as he scored an injury-time header that was nothing like as spectacular as his goal against Crystal Palace but every bit as important as Arsenal staged a remarkable comeback. With little more than 20 minutes remaining Arsenal were staring at the prospect of a chastening defeat after Bournemouth had run the visitors’ defence ragged. Eddie Howe’s team were 3-0 up, the travelling Arsenal supporters had turned on their own team and it was hard to see a way back for Arsène Wenger’s players. Laurent Koscielny had departed with cramp, Héctor Bellerín was enduring what must go down as one of the most difficult nights of his career and there was no hint of a recovery. Yet in the 70th minute Alexis Sánchez headed in at the far post and, as Howe would ruefully later reflect, that was the key moment in this helter-skelter match. Arsenal gained some belief and the balance of the game shifted – not just because of Sánchez’s goal. Ryan Fraser, who scored Bournemouth’s third goal and won the penalty that led to Callum Wilson converting from the spot earlier in the match, had been forced off through injury, meaning that the home team no longer had that lightning quick outlet on the left to stretch Arsenal. It became a question of whether Bournemouth could hold their nerve and keep Arsenal at bay for long enough, yet within five minutes Wenger’s side had a second when Lucas Pérez volleyed beautifully into the far corner of the net. Incredibly Bournemouth came close to scoring a fourth but Dan Gosling curled wide and the significance of that miss soon became clear. With eight minutes left, Simon Francis went into a full-blooded challenge with Aaron Ramsey that Michael Oliver, the referee, deemed worthy of a straight red. It seemed a little harsh and left Bournemouth, who were retreating deeper and deeper, desperately hanging on. The game had ticked into the 92nd minute when Granit Xhaka delivered a cross that Giroud, towering above Steve Cook, headed beyond Artur Boruc. Arsenal had somehow rescued the most unlikely point, breaking Bournemouth hearts in the process. The home changing room, Howe admitted, was a desperately quiet place after the match. Arsenal, in fairness, deserve credit for turning the game around, especially in light of the fact that this was their second fixture in the space of two days. It was not as if Wenger made wholesale changes – he retained eight of the side that started against Palace – and it says something about their character and resilience that they never gave up. Yet defensively Arsenal were all over the place at the times and it was alarming to see how easily Bournemouth exposed their weaknesses at the back. Arsenal’s start was about as bad as it gets and Wenger was soon wearing that familiar pained expression on his face. His side conceded twice in the opening 20 minutes, Francis Coquelin limped off before the half-hour mark and, in another sign that everything was unravelling for Arsenal, Sánchez and Ramsey were raging at one another. Bournemouth, on the other hand, were enjoying themselves and reaping the rewards of Howe’s bold tactics. Despite being without Benik Afobe, who was unable to play because Democratic Republic of Congo had not provided international clearance in the wake of the striker’s decision to withdraw from their Africa Cup of Nations squad, Howe still went with two up front. Wilson and Joshua King filled those positions and troubled Arsenal time and again with their pace in behind. Yet it was Charlie Daniels, the Bournemouth left-back, who opened the scoring with a superbly taken goal. Running into the space that opened up behind Bellerín, Daniels controlled Junior Stanislas’s crossfield pass, stepped inside the Arsenal right-back and beat Petr Cech at his near post. Four minutes later Wilson scored from the spot after Xhaka pushed Fraser over in the area as the Scot scampered clear. Wenger felt that it was a soft penalty but Xhaka was playing with fire when he placed his left hand on Fraser’s back. It seemed inevitable there would be an Arsenal response after the restart and so it proved for a period, yet it was Bournemouth who struck again. Daniels slid a pass into the inside left channel and Bellerin, who is no slouch, had a headstart on Fraser. Yet Fraser not only caught up with the Arsenal defender but was too strong for him. Darting into the area after Bellerin had felt the force of his shoulder charge, Fraser slipped the ball through Cech’s legs and Bournemouth were in dreamland. Arsenal, however, were not done. Sánchez nodded in at the far post after Giroud flicked on Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain’s cross and in the blink of an eye it was 3-2 following a fine piece of play involving Sánchez, Xhaka and Giroud that ended with Pérez spearing a lovely left-footed volley beyond Boruc. Then was all about Giroud, who has started 2017 with a bang.','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/03/bournemouth-arsenal-premier-league-match-report','Olivier Giroud caps Arsenal’s fightback to earn point in Bournemouth thriller',386,'football'),('football/live/2017/jan/03/bournemouth-v-arsenal-premier-league-live','And that’s your lot from this one. Thanks for reading! But could Arsenal have won it...? Meanwhile, the Vitality is yer place for entertainment this season: 3-3 from 3-0 today, 4-3 from 3-1 in the game against Liverpool, 6-1 against Hull, a 3-2 defeat in extra-time to Preston in the EFL Cup. Lovely stuff. So Arsenal produce a brilliant comeback, but potentially lose further ground on Chelsea at the top, and remain in striking distance of Tottenham. That game tomorrow is really a no-win for them... A weird result: Bournemouth probably would’ve taken the draw before the game but walk off dejected, while a point isn’t a huge amount of use to Arsenal but they depart the scene relieved. The Bournemouth players aren’t happy about the sending off, with the excellent Arter giving a big sarcastic thumbs up to the officiating team, before declaring Oliver an “effing joke.” What a game! 90 mins + 5: Gosling tries to bring the ball out of defence but is blocked off by Xhaka. 90 mins + 4: Arter works himself some space on the right of the box and bashes a shot towards goal, which Cech saves and just as well too - if he hadn’t got his hands to that it might have taken his head clean off. 90 mins + 3: Both teams think they can win this one now... 90 mins + 2: Xhaka curls a cross into the area, Giroud rises and gets a brilliant glancing header into the bottom corner. It might not have been as spectacular as the scorpion kick the other day, but it’s sure as hell more important. They’ve done it! 90 mins + 1: The first of six minutes added time... 90 mins: Time-wasting/vital tactical sub for Bournemouth - Brad Smith is on for Wilson, who opts for the textbook technique of shaking hands with the ref on his way off the pitch. 89 mins: Sanchez slips a pass through to Perez, but that’s too far ahead of him. Will they hold out? 87 mins: Arsenal claim a handball for a cross that just seemed to thud into Smith’s tummy. No penalty, and it’s worth noting that referee Oliver has had a pretty decent game tonight. There was the potential shove for Bournemouth’s third, but that was borderline. 86 mins: Sanchez chips over the defensive line for Ramsey, but instead of controlling the ball as he possibly had time to do, he tries an incredibly difficult spinning volley and skews it wide. Boruc is booked for taking his sweet time over the goal kick. 85 mins: Arsenal most definitely have the sniff now, and Sanchez clips a ball to the back post where Giroud...somehow doesn’t head home. Big pressure on the Bournemouth goal, and presumably will be for about ten minutes... Bournemouth down to ten as Francis goes over the ball on Ramsey - there wasn’t a huge amount of contact, but that was a dangerous challenge. Big problems now for Bournemouth. 82 mins: And that leads to a glorious chance - Gosling finds himself in the box, spins and gets around Giroud, defending for some reason, but hoys the shot wide. 81 mins: Wilson toiling up top on his own, but he does manage to retain possession. Bournemouth push up and do the sensible thing, by knocking it around high up the pitch for a bit. 79 mins: Yellow card for Mustafi after a fairly routine foul on Wilson - but that wasn’t his first routine foul, so a yellow it is. 78 mins: Bournemouth look rather nervy now. And with good reason.... 75 mins: Smashing goal, as Xhaka plays a ball into Giroud, he flicks it up in the air and to the left of the box, where the substitute Perez absolutely leathers a volley into the far corner. Suddenly the Arsenal fans have hope... It’s on! 74 mins: A ball is clipped over the top of the defence for Sanchez, he brings it down and almost has a shot from close range, but the linesman puts his flag up signalling, quite rightly, a handball. 72 mins: Because Eddie Howe could do with some advice from a minute-by-minuter, the best way for them to go now would be as they were just after half-time. They briefly looked as if they would go into their collective shell and sit back, but then went on the front foot. If they do that again, they should be fine. 70 mins: Simple one: Giroud flicks on a cross at the near-post, and Sanchez is there at the far to head home. Could they...? Now then... 69 mins: A rare Arsenal attack breaks out, and Giroud - having clearly decided this is Absurd Spectacular Goals Week - tries an audacious bicycle kick, but only swipes at air. 67 mins: But that might be the last from Fraser - he goes down holding his calf, and before more damage is done he’s off, Adam Smith replacing him. 66 mins: More danger from Fraser, as he skips around Mustafi and is through on goal, but the slightly unlikely figure of Oxlade-Chamberlain swoops in to save the day. 65 mins: The home crowd haven’t quite got the ‘Olés’ out yet, but it’s close, as Wilson does a semi-Cruyff turn thing on the touchline. 63 mins: Subs for both teams - Andrew Surman replaces King for Bournemouth, while for Arsenal Lucas Perez is on for Iwobi, and Gabriel replaces Koscielny. Presumably he’s injured - that or Wenger doesn’t want his confidence to be battered by this shambles any further. 62 mins: “Who needs pre-match fireworks and loud noises when you can watch another season explode in mid-flightand fall back harmlessly to earth in ashes?” laments Justin Kavanagh. “A season in which a donkey kick is the highlight seems somehow apt for the Arse these days.” 61 mins: A free-kick to Bournemouth after a cynical foul by Mustafi. Stanislas curls it over the wall but Cech can get to that one, and he paws it away. 60 mins: Arsenal try to get back into things straight away, but Sanchez’s shot goes wide. They’re a rabble tonight. 58 mins: Bellerin is having an absolute torrid here. Boruc takes a catch, rolls it out to Arter, who flings a ball down the Bournemouth left for Fraser to chase with Bellerin. The winger barges the full-back to the floor - possibly illegally, but either way Bellerin was weak - dashes inside then pops the ball between Cech’s legs, and into the net. 3-0! That one’s allowed though! GOA...no, it’s disallowed! 56 mins: The ball breaks to Arter on the edge of the box, who absolutely leathers a shot towards goal but it takes a deflection off Wilson as it goes in. The eagle-eyed referee Oliver spots that it hit Wilson’s arm, and the goal is not allowed. 54 mins: Giroud seems OK. Arsenal are getting some more purposeful attacks in, but Bournemouth are sitting incredibly deep - as Mustafi gets the ball on the edge of the centre-circle, in the Cherries’ half, no home player is further than 35 yards from his own goal. Will be a long old 36-odd minutes if they carry on like that. 52 mins: Giroud is writhing around on the floor holding his ankle - looks like he got quite badly studded by King as both went in for a challenge, but it didn’t seem to be intentional. 51 mins: A little better from Arsenal - they’re at least now giving Giroud a bit of service - he gets a head to one cross and a chest to another. Can easily see them getting back in to this one. 49 mins: Arsenal at least look like they’re playing with a little more purpose in the opening stages. Sanchez manages to dig out a shot but it’s blocked by a couple of defenders at the near post. 47 mins: Monreal makes a run down the left, but commits the cardinal sin of being caught offside when he can look right down the line. Silly Nacho. 46 mins: And we’re away. “Regarding ‘murican hoopla, I watched a football match at Stanford a few years ago pitching the Cardinals against Notre Dame,” writes Pierre Bernardi. “The pre-match entertainment featured jokes about the Irish eating potatoes and planting bombs. I can’t get enough of American ‘humor’.” The teams are out for the second 45. No changes at the break from either side. Well, Sanchez seems to have pulled his socks up just a little higher, to around his knees, but other than that, no changes. As a small bit of half-time reading, with plenty of discussion about fixture list compiling around at the moment, here’s a Q&amp;A with the bloke who decides all this, getting all the flak from Arsène and Sam. Stanislas hits the set piece into the wall, and that’s the last action of the half. The Arsenal fans present boo as their players slink off. 45 mins + 3: Iwobi gives the ball away and Wilson breaks through the middle, but Ramsey stops him by dragging him to the turf. A yellow card for the Welshman, and a free-kick in a dangerous place for Bournemouth. 45 mins + 2: Bournemouth very much ending the half as they have most of it so far - Stanislas whips a shot from the edge of the box, but it skips just wide with Cech at full stretch. 45 mins +1: Ake is allowed to almost absent-mindedly wander straight through the middle of the Arsenal side, but doesn’t slip the ball through to Wilson in space behind the defence, and eventually the attack ends when Stanislas is penalised for a push on Monreal. 45 mins: Daniels dashes down the left and is very nearly wiped out by a reckless Mustafi. He gets to the byline, gathers himself, but the cross is plucked by Cech. Three minutes of injury-time to be played. 44 mins: Cook gently goes through the back of Sanchez, if that doesn’t sound too weird, and receives a deserved booking. 42 mins: Apart from anything else, this is another game in which Arsenal have picked Giroud as centre-forward and not played to anything like his strengths. He can’t score an absurd scorpion goal every game you know. 41 mins: A chance, if you can think of such a thing, for Arsenal: Oxlade-Chamberlain makes tracks down the right, heads for the byline, cuts back to Iwobi who shoots, but a diving challenge by Francis is enough to significantly put him off. 38 mins: Arter, incidentally, is back on but moving like a man with a dodgy hip on an ice rink. 37 mins: Charles Antaki has seen the future, and it looks rather like the past for Arsenal: “Seasoned Arsenal watchers will read the signs resignedly - this has all the makings of a full meltdown. A sending-off, two more goals, and Sánchez off with a long-term injury. Otherwise, some pleasant approach work.” 36 mins: Arter does seem to have done himself some mischief, though - he receives some treatment and hops towards the touchline, but there’s no movement on the bench yet so it’s likely that he’ll be OK. 35 mins: A lovely 30 seconds or so from Bournemouth as they move the ball around swiftly and smartly, pulling space from which there was none, some of which is used to tee up Arter, but his shot is skewed comfortably wide. 34 mins: Wilson arrows in on goal from the right, and Mustafi tries one of those lunging challenges that look great if they come off, but moronic if they don’t. Luckily for him, in this case it was the former. 32 mins: Two Arsenal players compete to get a booking: firstly Xhaka just about pulls off a wild-looking lunge on Daniels, but then Bellerin wins the yellow prize by hacking down Fraser. 30 mins: One might indeed... 29 mins: Half chance for Arsenal, as Sanchez finds Ramsey nicely just inside the area, he spins and shoots, but it takes a slight deflection and goes just wide. 28 mins: Coquelin’s hammy is confirmed as banjaxed, so Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain comes on for him. Presumably that’ll be Ramsey slotting deeper into midfield, the new man on the wing and Iwobi back to No.10. 27 mins: Angus Macaskill isn’t best impressed with Xhaka: “Yes, he’s a good passer but he has no pace and repeatedly gives away fouls. Both these defects in evidence in conceding that penalty. He just doesn’t command midfield like he needs to. Oh, and his first corner and free kick failed to clear the first man.” 26 mins: More woe for Arsenal - Coquelin is on the turf and holding his left hamstring, which is never a good sign. 24 mins: As pointless shoves go, that Xhaka one was reminiscent of Emmanuel Eboue bundling Lucas over back in 2011. Now that was a funny afternoon. 22 mins: What a few minutes that was. Sanchez tries to get Arsenal back into it, shooting from the left side of the area but way over the bar. He and Ramsey have a wee argument about it for a short while, as frustrations reach the surface. He slips it down the middle, and a particularly hungry cat has been thrown among some very jumpy pigeons. My days! Fraser dashes across the edge of the box, and Xhaka chooses the exact and only moment/yard he was actually in the area to shove him over. Brainless stuff, and up steps Wilson... 16 mins: Bellerin gets sucked a long way inside and leaves absolutely acres for Daniels to wander around in. Stanislas hoys over a terrific pass from the right flank, Daniels controls, neatly sidesteps a scrambling Bellerin like a man carefully rounding a giddy teenager on a scooter, then slips a finish inside Cech’s near post. Lovely goal, if preventable from an Arsenal point of view. Now then. 14 mins: Two separate people have sent in the same dictionary definition to suggest that ‘obligated’ is actually OK. So let’s nip that in the bud now before we get bogged down in squabbles about language. Let’s all just be nice to each other, eh? 12 mins: Big shout for a Bournemouth penalty as Wilson chases a ball that Cech comes out for, the striker goes down but referee Oliver isn’t impressed. Replays suggest that a) Cech got enough of a touch on the ball to suggest the official was correct, and b) Wilson’s knee caught Cech in the temple, in a not dissimilar way to Stephen Hunt’s all those years back. We take the piss out of that scrum cap, but you can see why, psychologically at least, Cech keeps it. He seems fine, by the way. 10 mins: 9 mins: A thud as the ball whacks into Cech’s chest, from a 25-yard shot by Stanislas which swerved and curved and the keeper did well to cling to. 8 mins: Early word for all you formation dorks/Arsenal fans out there: Ramsey seems to be at No.10, initially at least, with Iwobi on the right. 7 mins: A missive from pedrantists’ corner: “Please tell them ‘Muricans that the English word is obliged, not obligated. Yours in pedantry, David Acaster.” 5 mins: The first proper shot arrives as King takes aim from range, but drags his effort wide of Cech’s goal with Bournemouth colleagues watching on, frustrated. 4 mins: Arsenal inching their way into control. A Bellerin cross from the right is cleared, then the ball reaches Sanchez in the left channel, but his slipped pass looking for the run of Ramsey from deep, goes awry. 3 mins: On the whole pre-match hoopla, Matthew Sommer writes from Over There: “With all of us ‘Muricans watching, and the NFL making more headway on your side of the pond, maybe they feel obligated to make the pre-match spectacle more exciting. Future improvements to the Premier League will also include fake hand-clapping noises, “Get Loud” flashing across the big screen during penalties, and deafening music pumped through the loud speaker during any pause in the action. Oh, and more cheerleaders. The “Old Trafford-ettes” should be very popular.” 2 mins: Bournemouth try to launch the first real attack, but Harry Arter’s attempt at a booming cross from the left simply dribbles into Cech’s grasp. 1 min: And we’re away as Bournemouth, kicking from right to left, begin proceedings. The lights are back up, hands have been shaken, players are loose - football is imminent. Dipping the floodlights and putting on some sort of seizure-inducing strobe show seems to be a thing in the Premier League now: Crystal Palace were at it a few weeks ago, now Bournemouth are trying it out too. Apologies for being a silly old buffer, but what happened to just being happy with watching the football? Ian Copestake seems to think Wenger has been at the George RR Martin: “Arsene’s command of English has always been exemplary, even while retaining that unmistakeable heavy accent of the recently arrived. So when he pondered “if the Premier League masters the fixtures,” I feel his diction has now been tainted by him gorging on fantasy fiction during the two hours celebration time he was allotted. Expect his post match presser to be littered with sage pronouncements such as “a team needs rest as a sword needs a whetstone, if it is to keep its edge.” On the absence of Afobe, Howe explained that while he has told DR Congo that he’s not keen on playing for them in the Africa Cup of Nations, the necessary paperwork and clearance hasn’t come through, so rather than unleashing some sort of administrative hellscape, the striker isn’t involved tonight. Wenger says he wants to bring some “fresh legs” into the team, without disrupting the balance of the side. He also praises Bournemouth’s “constructive philosophy”, which is one of those things that just seems like a collection of noises rather than a meaningful statement. More concrete is the news that Ozil is still in bed with whatever sniffles have laid him low recently. So still no Mesut Ozil for Arsenal, and Theo Walcott isn’t back either. However, Shkodran Mustafi does return to the heart of the defence, while Aaron Ramsey is in for Lucas Perez and Francis Coquelin replaces Mohamed Elneny in the enforcer role. For Bournemouth, obviously there’s no Jack Wilshere for admin reasons, while Benik Afobe is also missing, presumably injured. Bournemouth Boruc; Francis, Cook, Ake, Daniels; Arter, Gosling; Fraser, Stanislas, King; Wilson. Subs: Federici, Mings, Adam Smith, Brad Smith, Surman, Ibe, Mousset. Arsenal Cech; Bellerin, Mustafi, Koscielny, Monreal; Coquelin, Xhaka; Ramsey, Iwobi, Sanchez; Giroud. Subs: Ospina, Maitland-Niles, Gabriel, Holding, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Perez, Reine-Adelaide. Referee: Michael Oliver (Ashington) If everything Arsène Wenger has been saying of late is true, his players will arrive at the Vitality Stadium tonight on their hands and knees, gasping and exhausted, sucking at a passing oxygen cylinder and trying to summon every last drip of energy so they can drag themselves onto the pitch to face Bournemouth. Wenger is unhappy with the fixture compiler, see, the mysterious force who has decreed his men only have two days rest since their last game, against Crystal Palace. “In 48 hours we go into a game with a big handicap on the fixture and I have to find fresh legs,” Wenger said after the Palace win. “In 20 years it is the most uneven Christmas period I’ve seen. The difference in rest period is unbelievable in terms of all the teams. It’s more we have sold the rights to TV for a lot of money so we have to accept TV chooses the games. But some teams have more luck than others.” Oh! An arch reference to the ‘luck’ of some unnamed teams! Could he possibly be talking about Chelsea, who played a day before Arsenal at the weekend, and this midweek play a day after? We think he might be! Oh Arsène. “Honestly I don’t really know if the Premier League masters the fixtures,” he added, wryly no doubt. In truth, Wenger has a point: the fixture list around this time of year clearly is absurd, and you don’t need to be no weird Dutch egg on Twitter to know that playing two games in such a short space of time, given the speed at which football is played these days, is pretty dangerous injury-wise. And when Wenger and Sam Allardyce - not exactly football’s version of Bert and Ernie - are of the same mind, it’s probably correct. Yet Wenger has more important things on his mind, surely. Specifically, staying in touch with a Chelsea juggernaut that is in danger of careening down the tracks and out of sight. They’re already five points ahead of Liverpool in second and nine in front of Arsenal in fourth - so the mathematicians among you will have surmised that should Wenger’s boys lose tonight and Chelsea win tomorrow, that’ll be a 12-point gap and we’re only just past the halfway point of the season. It’s not an exaggeration to say that a couple of adverse results this week and their title challenge is away with the wind. If you think it isn’t already. Standing in their way tonight, Bournemouth. A decent wee team who have a nagging consistency problem: should they defeat Arsenal, then it’ll be the first time they have won consecutive games this season, and the first time they manage it since March. Which isn’t to say they haven’t been playing well: the 3-0 defeat to Chelsea wasn’t flattering to Eddie Howe’s men, for example. Howe, of course, is the man some expect to succeed Wenger, and a small mutual appreciation society has opened, taken subs and sent out the badges in the run-up to this game. Howe, though, at least did a passable job of feigning surprise when asked about such things recently. “That’s news to me!” he said. “It’s strange to hear this because I’m actually engrossed in the job here.” File that one alongside all those comedians who say they don’t read their reviews. Still, should be a good one tonight. Tune in.

Sam Drinkwater, a 26-year-old who received his licence a matter of weeks ago, has a perfect record at Cheltenham, having sent out Tour Des Champs to score on the New Year’s Day card there, beating placed horses from the stables of David Pipe, Paul Nicholls and Colin Tizzard. “The phone’s been going quite a bit,” Drinkwater says, reflecting on his triumph at the yard bought by his family in late 2015 to support his ambition. A former jockey whose time in the saddle was ended by injury, Drinkwater sold his home, and his parents sold theirs, as resources were pooled to buy the stables. With them came 100 acres of Worcestershire land, previously used by an event rider and surprisingly tranquil considering they sit in the angle between the M5 and the M50. “Dad’s always been mad keen on racing,” Drinkwater says. “The family have been a massive support through this. If you’d seen mum and dad on New Year’s Day … I had to give them that, because otherwise, none of it would have been worthwhile.” Early success is important, also, for commercial reasons. Drinkwater has 10 horses, several owned by family members, and hopes to attract at least as many more. “I just needed Tour Des Champs to do well to try to get the owners in. So the pressure was on, really.” Drinkwater has saddled a total of seven runners but it already seems clear he knows what he is doing. The first of his two successes came on Boxing Day while the eyes of the racing world were on Kempton but his were on Sedgefield, where the heavily backed Working Title won easily under his brother, Joe. Like the Grand National-bound Tour Des Champs, Working Title is a veteran who long ago proved he had talent but has not always been able to express it. Drinkwater’s ability to keep such horses sweet and sound will be tested at Hereford on Wednesday, where Working Title runs again. The trainer fancies him. “It’s a very bad race. He’s got 12st 5lb but Joe takes off 7lb and he’s used to carrying 12st 7lb in point to points, so I can’t see that stopping him. It’s just if there’s an unexposed one lurking&nbsp;…” Being a thoroughly modern trainer, Drinkwater planned the layout of his gallops by using Google Maps, seeking a route that would provide the greatest possible climb from the land available. “It’s not like a mountain that you find at some of the top yards,” he says, but it appears to be serving him well. Having installed one surface, he had the confidence to rip it up and lay another, more testing version last summer, to give his horses more of a test. Asked to name a horse worth looking out for, Drinkwater says he is excited about Sergeant Brody, a half-brother to a Cheltenham Festival winner, The Package, and likely to be fitter next time than when making his hurdles debut recently. “He was quite an anxious type of horse when he came over from Ireland. It’s taken him a long time to mellow and chill out, so I didn’t want to gun him at home and get him lit up on the track. He could be quite nice.” Drinkwater seems keen to work out what is going on in his charges’ heads and believes the key to his future success lies in keeping them happy and relaxed. He credits the trainers Tom Lacey, Fergal O’Brien and Nigel Twiston-Davies as his main influences. Asked if he was always determined to have his own yard, Drinkwater recalls he “hated” horses until the age of 10. “There was a girl down the end of the road that I quite fancied and I remember her trotting her horse up the road. I said ‘Can I have a go, please?’ And so she chucked me up.”','https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/03/tour-des-champs-sam-drinkwater','Tour Des Champs success serves notice of trainer Sam Drinkwater’s potential',389,'sport'),('uk-news/2017/jan/03/terrified-mother-frances-cappuccini-died-c-section-advice-dismissed-inquest','A mother lost half of her blood and died after midwives disregarded advice that she give birth via a caesarean section, an inquest has heard. Frances Cappuccini was terrified of giving birth to her second child, according to her husband, and went into hospital in labour apparently certain she wanted the C-section recommended by her consultant obstetrician. After the procedure was delayed, however, and after a serious error relating to the treatment of her placenta, the 30-year-old bled heavily and died in intensive care. “Frankie was terrified,” Tom Cappuccini said on Tuesday at the inquest in Gravesend, Kent. “She was very certain she wanted me to make sure she had a C-section on arrival. “I put my trust and Frankie’s trust in the people that were there. They disregarded previous medical advice and we were made to feel small and insignificant. In hindsight I wish I had never agreed.” The inquest heard the expectant mother, from Offham in Kent, booked an elected C-section for 10 October 2012 at Tunbridge Wells hospital following an obstetrician’s advice at nearby Maidstone hospital. But she went into labour two days before, arriving at Tunbridge Wells hospital at about 8.30pm, where she explained she did not want a natural birth or epidural. The primary school teacher had suffered a placental tear while giving birth to her first child, Luca, four years previous. But midwives and doctors allegedly had “almost a smirk across their face, almost laughing”, saying a decision should not be made based on “pain and fear”, and allegedly said there was no reason she could not give birth naturally. After 12 hours in labour, she was rushed for a C-section at 8.30am, when surgeons made the serious error of leaving a large piece of placenta in the uterine cavity. She was feeding her son for the first time when she felt blood “flowing between her legs”, the inquest heard. She died from a cardiac arrest. Tom Cappuccini said: “I had the opportunity to kiss her and tell her how much I loved her. She said: ‘I love you and if anything happens make sure you look after the boys.’” The family’s lawyer, Neil Sheldon, told the coroner, Roger Hatch: “If the C-section had been undertaken in an elected basis promptly on arrival at hospital, possibly by a different surgeon, then that basic error may not have been made.” He asked the midwife Julie Ann Michaud: “You have a competent, intelligent, articulate adult patient who has come in and expressed a clear wish for a certain type of treatment. Why was that not the end of the matter?” Michaud, who described Frances Cappuccini as coming in with a feeling of “impending doom”, and denied talking her out of the C-section, said: “She was a lovely lady to look after.” Mike Atkins, representing Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS trust, said the error that occurred could have been made regardless of when the surgery took place. The inquest was originally halted in 2014 when the NHS trust made legal history by becoming the first to face corporate manslaughter charges. A judge dismissed the case at the Inner London crown court in February 2016. The inquest continues.','https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/03/terrified-mother-frances-cappuccini-died-c-section-advice-dismissed-inquest','\'Terrified\' mother died after C-section advice dismissed, inquest hears',390,'uk-news'),('commentisfree/2017/jan/03/the-guardian-view-on-ivan-rogers-resignation-a-loss-at-a-crucial-time','The unexpected and abrupt resignation of Sir Ivan Rogers from his post as Britain’s ambassador to the European Union is a blow for Britain. He was widely regarded as having the right experience, deft touch and nous to navigate the shoals and shifting currents of continental politics that would buffet the British ship of state as it left its European berth. In going early Sir Ivan will have not helped Theresa May with her Brexit plans. Although he was going to leave by October, his exit – ahead of key elections in France and Germany – means the UK has lost one of its top negotiators just as we were meant to get down to the serious business of leaving Europe. Sir Ivan was an insider’s insider. He was the government’s top Europe adviser at David Cameron’s side throughout Britain’s EU renegotiation, where some accused him of pusillanimity in the face of Brussels intransigence. In an email to colleagues Sir Ivan says it’s best to go before article 50 is invoked. Personal contacts and networks cultivated over decades will be lost. He was also a seasoned Westminster operator described by Ken Clarke, under whom he worked in the Treasury, as an “excellent British diplomat”. But such a recommendation, coupled with his cautious style, earned him the ire of Brexiters. While Mrs May consulted him on Brexit strategy, Sir Ivan’s relations with some of the prime minister’s team had reportedly begun to deteriorate in recent months. Last month Sir Ivan’s advice to Downing Street was leaked. In it he suggested it could take a decade for the EU to agree and ratify a comprehensive trade deal with Britain. Pro-Brexit MPs accused Sir Ivan of being a “gloomy pessimist”. The Daily Mail reported that “knives were out” for him. Sir Ivan may have found it hard to blow up bridges he had built with European neighbours. But we are in dangerous territory if we as a country allow the people we ask to bat on our behalf to be silenced because of a perceived viewpoint. What if the thought settles that, if the UK doesn’t get the deal Brexiters want, it will be the diplomats who get blamed? Do we risk being pushed into a hard Brexit for fear for speaking truth to power? Feelings are running high: a former Treasury chief tweeted that this was a “wilful and total destruction of EU expertise”. The government needs to quash the idea Sir Ivan paid a price for telling ministers unpalatable truths. There has to be room for civil servants to offer blunt, unvarnished advice to ministers without the fear of being seen as too pro-EU and defeatist. Sir Ivan pointedly called on colleagues to “challenge ill-founded arguments and muddled thinking” and deliver “disagreeable” messages “to those who need to hear them”. There is a structural problem with Sir Ivan’s present role: it has a dual reporting line to both Brexit secretary David Davis and foreign secretary Boris Johnson. The Institute for Government warned that “this will need to be managed carefully to avoid confusion and conflict”. The advice went unheeded but thought will need to be given to it to avoid future turbulence. This is the time for Mrs May to stamp her authority over the way Brexit is being run. Silence is not a strategy. There need to be options for MPs to discuss and an internal analysis so that ministers have a robust basis for the political choices they will need to make. All this when, as Sir Ivan notes, we are short on multilateral negotiating experience but Europe is not. Bizarrely the appointment of Sir Ivan’s replacement will tell us more about the kind of politics, diplomacy and trade that Britain will seek in the negotiations with the EU than Mrs May’s gnomic utterances. Sir Ivan’s successor will need a deep insight into the way Brussels works and have the trust of European capitals. He or she will also need the confidence of the prime minister. The message that Downing Street will send with the appointment of Britain’s person in Brussels will be critical: not just to Whitehall but to the rest of Europe as well.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/03/the-guardian-view-on-ivan-rogers-resignation-a-loss-at-a-crucial-time','The Guardian view on Ivan Rogers’ resignation: a loss at a crucial time | Editorial',391,'commentisfree'),('commentisfree/2017/jan/03/the-guardian-view-on-new-year-resolutions-fitter-happier-more-productive','A very rare thing is happening this week: hundreds of millions of people across the world are undertaking a massive economics experiment. True, hardly any of us think of it as such. Instead, we pledge to lose weight, give up the demon weed or just to get along with our mothers-in-law. But each of these New Year resolutions are exercises in attempting to change what we do – and as such are voyages deep into social science. Your pledge to lead a healthier and happier life is terrain on which the economists have firmly planted their flag. The US professor and economics blogger Tyler Cowen claims: “Understanding economics can help you make better decisions and lead a happier life.” Wander into any bookshop and the economics section will be full of paperbacks promising to explain how and why single people choose to get married, send children to expensive private schools or deal drugs. Perhaps titles such as Freakonomics and the Undercover Economist can be accused of being pop. But consider the late Gary Becker, who received the Nobel prize for economics in 1992 for extending “the sphere of economic analysis to new areas of human behaviour and relations”. His trademark was to look not at “the economy” but to train his microscope on matters of daily life – racial discrimination, child-rearing, even suicide. Economists are often accused of treating humans as perfectly rational and far-seeing. That is a little unfair – but only a tad. As Michelle Baddeley, professor of economics at University College London, writes in her new book: “Most economists describe people as mathematical calculators – able easily and accurately to add up the money costs and benefits of their choices in pounds and pence, dollars and cents – and without worrying about what others around them are doing.” That can’t be said of Becker, who kicked off his Nobel lecture with these words: “I have tried to pry economists away from narrow assumptions about self-interest.” Becker looked for the rationality that underlay phenomena such as racism: this was part of what made him such a controversial figure. But, however imaginative his approach, it is of only limited use in determining why we break our resolutions – or, put another way, why we don’t do what we know we should. Economists do study decision-making and indeed resolutions. Much of what they say is of great help in fighting January’s ground war of noble spirit versus weak flesh: announce your commitments, perhaps attach a financial incentive to observing them. But what economists are less good at is providing a convincing explanation of why the majority of us break our resolutions – why we fail. Those explanations are best provided by psychology and sociology – the award in 2002 of the economics Nobel to psychologist Daniel Kahneman for his (together with Amos Tversky) seminal work on “human judgment and decision-making under uncertainty” is an implicit acceptance of the limits of economics. There’s nothing necessarily wrong with that. Mainstream economics struggles to integrate behavioural insights into its models. The gulf may be too big – and it is best to stop trying to bridge it but instead acknowledge the limits of economics. In his General Theory, John Maynard Keynes often delves into psychology: the “beauty contest” of investment, the “animal spirits” needed for entrepreneurialism. These and other subjects he left as areas of “uncertainty” rather than attempting what today’s bankers would do and quantify them as risks. This is a more limited economics, but also a more honest form. Almost a decade after a crash that so few of them foresaw, economists would do better to own up to what they don’t know rather than chucking in their tuppen’oth into subjects outside their ken. So when, as seems statistically likely, you break your January resolution, take this&nbsp;crumb of comfort: you and millions of&nbsp;others have proved again the need for a more modest economics.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/03/the-guardian-view-on-new-year-resolutions-fitter-happier-more-productive','The Guardian view on New Year resolutions: fitter, happier, more productive | Editorial',392,'commentisfree'),('us-news/2017/jan/03/talladega-college-marching-band-trump-inauguration-alabama','The marching band of Alabama’s oldest private, historically black liberal arts college has accepted an invitation to perform at Donald Trump’s inaugural parade, organizers said. Talladega College’s band will march at Trump’s inauguration on 20 January, although other historically black schools such as Howard University, which performed at Barack Obama’s first inaugural parade, have said they will not be marching at the event. “We were a bit horrified to hear of the invitation,” said Shirley Ferrill of Fairfield, Alabama, a member of Talladega’s Class of 1974. “I don’t want my alma mater to give the appearance of supporting him,” Ferrill said of Trump on Monday. “Ignore, decline or whatever, but please don’t send our band out in our name to do that.” Ferrill began an online petition this weekend requesting the band withdraw from the parade. On Tuesday morning, it had more than 500 signatures. “For Alabama’s oldest historically black college to give him a stamp of approval, I say no, and that is why I put the petition out there,” she later told the Guardian. Another petition was started in support of the band playing in the inaugural parade, AL.com reported. “We believe that this parade is not about politics, it’s about seeing firsthand the process of a transition. Its not to support of no political party its about the experience that the students will obtain,” the petition reads in imperfect grammar. “We are not one-track thinkers and believe everyone is entitled to the own beliefs. However we are in support of The United States of America.” Some 93 people have signed the petition so far. The move has lit up Talladega College’s social media sites with a sharp debate about the band’s decision to participate in the parade. Some voiced strong opposition, while others support the band’s participation. “After how black people were treated at Trump’s rallies, you’re going to go and shuck and jive down Pennsylvania Avenue? For what?” Seinya SamForay of Chicago told the Associated Press. “What they did is a slap in the face to other black universities.” SamForay was among dozens of people commenting on the school’s social media sites. The Presidential Inaugural Committee announced Friday that the Talladega College Marching Tornadoes was among 40 groups, including high school bands and military organizations, scheduled to perform in the parade. Some members of the Marist College band in upstate New York, also scheduled to perform at the inauguration, say they won’t participate, a school spokesman said on Monday. Ron White of Atlanta, a 1997 graduate of another historically black college, Fort Valley State University in Georgia, said he questioned why band members from Talladega “should be playing all these patriotic tunes for someone who has degraded us.” At the same time, though, White said he respects the office of the president and he hopes that Talladega’s band does well. “What they should do in my opinion is play that national anthem the best way they’ve ever played it in their life, because you’re basically saluting the country,” White said in an interview. The nation’s historically black colleges and universities instill in students the idea that “ignored behavior is condoned behavior”, said Reese Walker of Memphis, who marched in the band at Mississippi Valley State University. That’s one reason he doesn’t think Talladega College should participate. The Guardian called and emailed the college’s public affairs office, the office of the president and reached out to the school band via Facebook A Facebook page for “The Great Talladega College Tornado Marching Band” wrote on 22 December that the invitation was a “monumentus [sic] achievement for not only just the College and the band program but, for the entire state of Alabama! Keep us in your hearts and prayers as we vow to make you all proud!!” The post has a mix of positive and negative comments. The college was founded in 1867, by the descendants of the slaves who helped to build its first building, according to historical documents on the college’s website. The decision to march in Trump’s inaugural parade has also sparked controversy at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, New York. The band will be marching, but some of its members will be staying home, school spokesman Greg Cannon said Monday. “They don’t want to have anything to do with the inauguration or President Trump and we respect that, and that’s their right,” Cannon said. “We’re not looking to put anybody in a spot that conflicts with their personal beliefs,” he added. About six to eight Marist band members among more than 100 have said they won’t perform, Cannon said. He said there won’t be any repercussions for those students, and they will still have a place in the band when it returns from Washington DC. On Monday British singer Rebecca Ferguson said she would accept an invitation to perform at Trump’s inauguration on condition she be allowed to sing the anti-lynching anthem Strange Fruit.

Wafula Strike, a British wheelchair racer and a board member of UK Athletics, has called for companies to be fined if they don’t provide the facilities for disabled people that legislation requires. Fellow Paralympic athletes, including the TV presenter and wheelchair basketball player Ade Adepitan, backed her call for change. Adepitan told the Guardian that he too had been forced to urinate in a train carriage when the disabled toilet was not working. He acknowledged that it was slightly easier for men to improvise than women. “I have had to pee into a bottle in the past when the accessible toilet wasn’t working,” he said. “I would carefully arrange a coat over my knees under the train table and pee into a bottle held underneath my coat.” He said that he endured one particularly agonising train journey after returning from filming in India in 1999 suffering from a stomach upset only to discover there was no working disabled toilet. “Having to hold on until I got off the train was just terrible,” he said. “Not having accessible toilets available has happened to me more times than is tolerable. “A lot of these companies are just paying lip service. Really they are just taking the mickey. It’s a standing joke with me and my friends who are also wheelchair users when we go to a restaurant or bar and see that the disabled toilet isn’t usable because it is being used as a storeroom. There was one place we used to go to in Chiswick where they used to store bicycles in the disabled toilet.” He supported Wafula Strike’s call for fines to be imposed on organisations failing to provide suitable accessible facilities. “If there is no punishment and no fines nothing will change. The biggest problem is the people who are enforcing the rules who don’t do enough to enforce them, and the able-bodied public who use disabled toilets and park in disabled parking bays. Companies need to be attacked in their pockets and by naming and shaming them if they don’t provide the right facilities.” Adepitan said that the whole issue of travelling with a disability was a minefield. “When I was about 15 there were no accessible buses for me and my mates who also used wheelchairs to travel on,” he said. “So we went to High Street North in East Ham and blockaded the road with our wheelchairs for several hours, demanding accessible buses. It worked and a few months later the 101 bus was introduced which was an accessible bus. “I think what Anne has done should be like a beacon and a message to other disabled people not to be afraid to speak out. She’s right that we don’t speak out enough. We are entitled to everything that everyone else is entitled to.” The Paralympic athlete and wheelchair user Dzaier Neil also supported Wafula Strike’s call for sanctions for companies and organisations that fail to provide equality of access to people with disabilities. “I think things are just getting worse,” she said. “Getting round at all as a disabled person is a challenge. Getting on a bus is very difficult and some London boroughs have their own disabled badge systems so that the universal blue badges can’t be used in those areas if you’re not a resident in the borough.” Wafula Strike said she had been overwhelmed by tweets of support since going public. “The sad thing is the number of people who have contacted me since I went public and said that what happened to me on the train also happened to them,” she said. “One woman whose job is a psychologist said that she gets dehydrated when she travels by train because she is scared to drink anything at all in case there is no toilet available on the train. “I’ve learnt that if you speak up, the world does listen. As disabled people our voices can be weak, but I’m optimistic that now our voices are being heard and we will see change.” Her MP, Robert Halfon, described her treatment as a “totally unacceptable set of events for the 21st century”. Sarah Evans, and employment lawyer at Slater and Gordon, said: “It would be interesting to see if the fines that Anne has proposed would encourage compliance among organisations. “Disability discrimination is not just against people with physical disabilities but also those who suffer from mental illness. As practitioners we are aware that disability legislation doesn’t always work. “The onus in legislation is on the disabled person getting their rights enforced rather than the employer. In the workplace it is more difficult for employees to bring disability discrimination cases now than it used to be because of the fees regime introduced into the employment tribunal. This makes it less likely that individuals will pursue their rights.” She said that while things were better for people with disabilities than they were 20 years ago there was still a way to go before equality was achieved. “The obligations on employers are quite low – all they have to do is make reasonable adjustments for people with disabilities.” Faryal Velmi, director Transport for All, an organisation that provides advice for disabled travellers in London, said: “The humiliation that Anne went through is unfortunately a regular occurrence for disabled and older people travelling on our railways. “Transport for All has heard of many scandalous stories similar to hers and we know of people who have stopped travelling by train altogether after losing their confidence. “Anne’s case is another example of how we are treated as second-class citizens when travelling. Train companies that make handsome profits for their shareholders need to invest resources in ensuring that accessible toilets – and indeed all toilets facilities – are kept open and maintained for all customers.”','https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/03/transport-providers-come-under-pressure-improve-disabled-access-anne-wafula-strike-ade-adepitan','Transport providers come under pressure to improve disabled access',394,'society'),('books/2017/jan/03/costa-book-awards-deliver-for-baby-boomer-winners','It is a list of guaranteed to gladden the hearts of anyone who thinks they have left it too late to write their first book. Baby boomers, including Sebastian Barry, Keggie Carew, Francis Spufford and Alice Oswald have swept the board of category winners for the 2016 Costa book awards. Celebrating books across five categories – novel, first novel, children’s fiction, poetry and biography – the Costa awards pit the winners of each category against each other for the overall book of the year award, to be announced this year on 31 January. Spufford, 52, who won the first novel award for Golden Hill, a vivid evocation of 18th-century New York described by the judges as a “dazzlingly original tale [heralding] a bold, invigorating new voice in fiction”, said cowardice had kept him from tackling fiction despite his award-winning career in other genres. “I had the sense of fiction as the form in which you are most likely to expose your inadequacies in human experience and understanding,” he told the Guardian. Joking that publishing a novel in his early 50s was “more selfish than a midlife crisis”, Spufford said older novelists had advantages over younger rivals. “By now, you contain really quite a lot of distilled experience and that is to your advantage over people 20 years younger. But you do have to be able to remember what it was like to be younger than you are now.” Carew, who has already made her mark as a fine artist, scooped the biography award with her debut Dadland, a memoir-cum-detective story about her father, Tom Carew. She said her late start as a writer was “a case of arrested development”, adding: “It is a debut book, but it is the book for me. I have a shed-full of stuff, but I always knew this was [the one] I was supposed to write.” Described by the judges as “hilarious and heartbreaking”, Carew’s memoir follows her quest to uncover the truth about Tom as he descends into dementia. A law unto himself, she discovered that the man in whose “gravitational field” she grew up had been a Bulldog Drummond-style action man. Serving as a member of the elite Special Operations Executive, he had worked behind enemy lines in France and Burma during the second world war. The 59-year-old said Dadland had taken years to write. “I stopped at one point and threw the first draft away. I had a really clear idea of what I wanted to do, but it was like grappling with a wild octopus bringing all the strands together.” Asked what advice she would give others starting out as writers, she advised: “I would say, ‘Don’t do it, it’s hell!’” Though Carew was the oldest of the first-timers on the list, she was not the oldest overall: Irish novelist Sebastian Barry, now 61, took that accolade, winning novel of the year for Days Without End, about two teenage comrades - one Irish and one American - who get caught up in the civil and “Indian” wars. The novel, praised in the Guardian as “a work of staggering openness; its startlingly beautiful sentences … so capacious that they are hard to leave behind, its narrative so propulsive that you must move on”, puts Barry in the running for his second overall Costa win. The Secret Scripture was Costa book of the year in 2008, and even before the category winners were announced, the Dublin-born playwright and novelist was bookies’ 2-1 favourite to take the overall prize for 2016 at the end of the month. “It knocks your socks off every time, even in your 60s,” he said when it was shortlisted in November. “Winning the Costa changed my life. I was able to send my kids to university with that prize. To be at the cadet stage again, that is so exciting.” Children’s book winner Brian Conaghan, who won with The Bombs That Brought Us Together, offers hope to unpublished writers with piles of rejection slips from literary agents and publishers, having received more than 200 refusals for his debut The Boy Who Made it Rain, which was published in 2011. His next book, When Mr Dog Bites, was shortlisted for the Carnegie medal. Years as a frustrated unpublished writer had strengthened him, Conaghan told the Scottish Book Trust last year. “I spent years getting rejection after rejection - basically being told my work was rank rotten – so I’m pretty immune to reviews good or bad,” he said. His latest book was described by Costa judges as “a necessary take on modern life in extraordinary circumstances”. Alice Oswald, 50, completed the five category winners, taking the poetry award with her seventh collection, Falling Awake. It explores life’s losing struggle with the gravity of nature and is designed to be read aloud. “She finds words for encounters with nature that ordinarily defy language,” wrote Observer reviewer Kate Kellaway. All five writers receive £5,000 and are now in the running for the Costa book of the year, worth £30,000 and announced on 31 January. • This article was amended on 2 February 2017.

About 2,500 members of BA’s mixed fleet – which is predominantly made up of younger and lower-paid cabin crew – will walkout for 48 hours from next Tuesday after the company’s latest offer was rejected. BA said it would “plan to ensure that all our customers travel to their destinations” despite the strike, adding that it would publish details of its contingency plans on Friday. Some flights are expected to be cancelled. The mixed fleet accounts for about 15% of BA’s total cabin crew. A two-day walkout scheduled for Christmas was suspended after talks between the Unite union and the airline. But after the union members again rejected the offer, Unite called a strike before the mandate from a ballot expires, a deadline the union said the airline refused to extend. Unite accused BA of “needlessly seeking conflict”. It said the airline was blocking meaningful talks and was seeking to unpick the progress made in talks at the conciliation service Acas before Christmas. Unite national officer Oliver Richardson said: “British Airways is needlessly provoking strike action by refusing to extend the mandate of the strike ballot and allow meaningful talks to take place. “Instead of listening to why its mixed fleet cabin crew rejected the offer negotiated at Acas, British Airways has sought instead to try and bully a workforce of young men and women who are trying to eke out a living on poverty pay.” He added that the union remained hopeful that a negotiated settlement could be achieved. A BA spokeswoman said: “We are extremely disappointed that Unite has once again chosen to target our customers. “We are now focused on protecting our customers from this unnecessary and completely unjustified action. “Our proposal for our mixed fleet cabin crew reflects pay awards given by other companies in the UK and will ensure their reward levels remain in line with cabin crew at our airline competitors. It is also consistent with pay deals agreed with Unite for other British Airways colleagues.” She added that the airline was continuing its dialogue with unions and cabin crew, saying: “We remain focused on resolving this issue as quickly as possible.” All new cabin crew at BA are recruited to the mixed fleet branch, which was set up in 2010 on lower pay and conditions than existing crew, stoking one of Britain’s most prolonged and bitter strikes of recent years. Average pay, including allowances, is around £16,000 a year for the crew, according to Unite, a figure disputed by BA which said all were paid at least £21,000 after bonuses. Discontent has been exacerbated by high executive pay and large profits at the airline, with its parent company, IAG, forecasting annual profits of €2.5bn (£2.3bn), largely driven by BA.','https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/03/british-airways-cabin-crew-to-go-on-strike-next-week-in-pay-dispute','British Airways cabin crew to go on strike next week in pay dispute',396,'business'),('music/2017/jan/03/coachella-2017-lineup-beyonce-radiohead-kendrick-lamar','Beyoncé, Radiohead and Kendrick Lamar have been announced as headliners for this year’s Coachella festival.

Kelly, 46, made headlines during the 2016 election season, first for raising the hackles of Donald Trump, who responded with crude jokes at her expense, and then for joining the two dozen women, led by former Fox anchor Gretchen Carlson, who accused the network’s disgraced former chairman Roger Ailes of harassment. Ailes denies all charges of sexual misconduct. In her Facebook post on Tuesday, Kelly said: “I remain deeply grateful to Fox News, to Rupert, Lachlan and James Murdoch and especially to all of the FNC viewers, who have taught me so much about what really matters.” NBC News head Andy Lack has reportedly offered Kelly a role that will radically change the broadcaster’s news agenda: a daytime news and talkshow, a weekly news program on Sunday evenings and a regular role in NBC’s politics and event coverage. It will also leave a void in Fox’s heretofore invincible primetime lineup: Kelly’s 9pm weeknight show is key to the network’s primetime ratings dominance. Kelly’s move was first reported by the New York Times. Kelly was the second-most popular on-air personality on Fox News behind flamboyant commentator Bill O’Reilly. She was seen as a counterpoint to the network’s signature talk-radio-on-TV style programming. Kelly’s feud with the US president-elect began in August last year during the presidential primaries, when she questioned him robustly during a debate. Trump later told Fox rival network CNN that Kelly had had “blood coming out of her wherever” during the questioning and that he didn’t “respect her as a journalist”. Ailes backed Trump over Kelly, whose only commentary on the incident was a brief statement on her own program: “I will not apologize for doing good journalism.”Trump also publicly took Ailes’s part during his ouster. In November, Kelly revealed details of Ailes’s alleged harassment, claiming that he repeatedly tried to kiss her, in her memoir Settle for More, which debuted on bestseller lists. She also took aim at Trump and her colleagues in the book, saying that others at the pro-Trump network had tipped off the president-elect to critical questions during primary debates hosted by Fox. As the company settled with Gretchen Carlson for $20m late last year, Ailes’ abrupt departure created chaos among the disparate conservative factions whose first allegiance had been to Ailes himself, a longtime TV impresario much admired in Republican circles and a former media fixer for Richard Nixon. In the wake of the subsequent instability, Murdoch empire scions Lachlan and James looked to Kelly for the network’s future, promising her a reported $20m annually to re-sign and stay with the company through the transition. Kelly’s contract ends in July. In a statement Fox chairman Rupert Murdoch thanked Kelly for her “12 years of contributions to FOX News”. “We hope she enjoys tremendous success in her career and wish her and her family all the best,” he said.','https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/jan/03/megyn-kelly-leaving-fox-news-to-join-nbc-news','Megyn Kelly leaving Fox News to join NBC News in multiple roles',398,'media'),('sport/2017/jan/03/brock-osweiler-starting-quarterback-oakland-raiders','Brock Osweiler has the chance to make amends for a disappointing regular season after the Texans confirmed he would start at quarterback in Saturday’s playoff game against the Raiders. Osweiler, who signed from the Broncos on a massive $72m, four-year contract in the offseason, started the season with high hopes but struggled badly in Houston, throwing more interceptions than touchdowns. He has a pass completion rate of just 59%. The 26-year-old Osweiler was benched for Tom Savage in the week 15 victory over the Jaguars after he threw two interceptions in the first half. Savage started the game against the Titans on Sunday, but was carted off the field with a head injury, and remains in concussion protocol. Osweiler came in early in the second quarter and threw 21-of-40 for 253 yards and a touchdown. He also ran for a one-yard touchdown late in the fourth quarter. Savage was 5-of-8 for 25 yards and a fumble before he got injured. “I thought Brock did some really good things on Sunday with his team-mates,” Houston coach Bill O’Brien said on Tuesday. “He almost brought us all the way back. He did a nice job and we have a lot of confidence in him that he’s going to go out there and play well on Saturday.” Houston are chasing their first playoff victory since 2012.

Trump’s picks reveal a penchant for military brass, political outsiders, Wall Street titans and ... white men. The picks do not betray a particular faith in the value of prior government experience. Here’s the list so far: State: Rex Tillerson Tillerson, 64, outgoing chairman of ExxonMobil after 41 years with the energy giant. Has a history of close business ties to Russian president Vladimir Putin, who bestowed the Order of Friendship on Tillerson in 2013. He signed a 2011 agreement giving his energy company access to the huge resources under the Russian Arctic in return for giving the giant state-owned Russian oil company, OAO Rosneft, the opportunity to invest in ExxonMobil’s operations overseas. Climate change skeptic. According to regulatory filings, Tillerson retains a huge financial interest in the energy company, owning $151m in company stock. He may face questions from senators over the potential benefits to ExxonMobil from US foreign policy if sanctions imposed on Russia after its annexation of Crimea were lifted. Senators from both parties have also raised concerns about Tillerson’s lack of government experience and close ties to Putin. Read further. Defense: James N Mattis Mattis, 66, retired marine corps general. Led troops to combat in both Afghanistan and Iraq and rose to top military commands. Stepped down as commander of US central command in 2013. Hawkishness especially on Iran put him at odds with the Obama administration. Has called for a “new security architecture for the Mideast built on sound policy … Iran is a special case that must be dealt with as a threat to regional stability, nuclear and otherwise”. Only three years out of active duty, would require a congressional waiver of a federal law requiring a seven-year cooling off period for defense. Nicknamed “Mad Dog”. Read further. Homeland security: John F Kelly Kelly, 66, retired marine corps general. After a 45-year military career, Kelly stepped down in January 2016 as commander of the US southern command, a role in which he was responsible for US military activities and relationships in Latin America and the Caribbean, including the controversial detention facility at Guantánamo Bay. Has warned about border security. His son Robert, a first lieutenant in the marines, was killed in combat in Afghanistan in 2010, making Kelly the most senior US officer to have lost a child in the “war on terror”. Read further. CIA director: Mike Pompeo Pompeo, 52, a third-term congressman from Kansas. After the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013, Pompeo falsely claimed that US Muslim organisations and religious leaders had not condemned terrorism. He called those at the CIA who participated in torture “heroes, not pawns in some liberal game being played by the ACLU and [former intelligence committee chair] Senator [Dianne] Feinstein”. Opponent of closing the detention facility at Guantánamo Bay, a vocal critic of the Iran nuclear deal and a supporter of NSA bulk data collection. Has called for “the traitor Edward Snowden” to be executed. Read further. Treasury: Steven Mnuchin Mnuchin, 53, campaign finance chairman. Former Goldman Sachs, hedge funder and Hollywood producer (Sully, American Sniper, The Legend of Tarzan). Son of Goldman Sachs employee, Yale grad. Swooped on doomed IndyMac bank as it sunk in the 2008 housing crash, acquired it and scored when the federal government bailed out the bank. They call him the “foreclosure king”. Democratic senator Sherrod Brown said: “This isn’t draining the swamp – it’s stocking it with alligators.” Announced he would oversee “the largest tax change since Reagan” and said his “No 1 priority is tax reform”. Read further. Attorney general: Jeff Sessions Sessions, 69, US senator from Alabama in his fourth term. Former US attorney, state attorney general. An immigration hardliner who was an early Trump adopter, becoming the first senator to back the eventual winner. Sessions’ last confirmation hearing, for a federal judgeship under Ronald Reagan in 1986, was derailed when former colleagues testified that he used the N-word, called a black assistant US attorney “boy” and joked that he thought the Ku Klux Klan were “OK until I found out they smoked pot”. Has emphasised “law and order”, seen by some liberals as a coded phrase for discriminatory policing of minorities. Read further. US trade representative: Robert Lighthizer Lighthizer, 69, a former deputy US trade representative in the Ronald Reagan administration. Trump’s pick is intended to add muscle to US trade policy, particularly with regard to China. Lighthizer, in his current incarnation as a Washington trade lawyer with a top-flight corporate clientele, has testified before Congress that the US-China trade deficit is “a major threat to our economy” and recommended “a much more aggressive approach in dealing with China”. “Bob Lighthizer is very smart, very strategic and totally fearless,” a Washington attorney who has worked with him for three decades but asked not to be named told Reuters. “You can expect him to use every tool available to create leverage to get China and anyone else to stop the cheating. He is no fan of the [World Trade Organization].” Director of National Intelligence: Dan Coats Coats, 73, first elected to Congress in 1980 and just concluded a term as a senator from Indiana. Former US ambassador to Germany. A former member of the senate intelligence community, but has no especially deep background in intelligence issues. Has “swung back and forth between government service and lobbying, the type of Washington career that Trump has mocked,” the AP noted. Labor: Andrew F Puzder Puzder, 66, restaurant executive operating fast-food chains including Carl’s Jr and Hardee’s.

In his address to the Woodford folk festival, he depicted the states as representing “the meanderings of British explorers across the Australian continent more than 200 years ago”. In Hawke’s version of history, “lines were drawn on a map and jurisdiction and governance followed”. His conclusion is unambiguous: “The simple fact is the states should be abolished.” The actual simple fact it is that Hawke’s narrative is nonsense. The states were not created through the whims of explorers, and they form the basis of Australia’s constitutional existence. Whatever the claims of efficiency that underlie the desire for abolition – predicated on the belief that centralisation inherently reduces costs and creates better outcomes – there are good reasons to dismiss the idea. Australia had no states 200 years ago, just one British colony: New South Wales, which encompassed much of the continent. The total grew to six between 1825 and 1859. Britain claimed Western Australia in 1827. The other four, plus New Zealand, were excised from NSW. Some colonies were created for administrative convenience and to realise settlement ambitions. Others achieved separation after campaigns that brought together settlers from all social classes. Aboriginal peoples, in a too-familiar story, were ignored. Victoria’s separation is the most famous, divorcing NSW in 1851. Queensland in 1859 was the last new colony on the Australian continent. New England, northern Queensland, the Riverina, and other regions also sought separation. They either proved too small in area or population, or ran ineffectual campaigns. These movements were a big deal, successful or not. Many regions trace their identities, rivalries and political divisions back to them. Separatists created names and symbols, founded media outlets, and defined regional boundaries. New colonies met real needs; they were not the haphazard lines of explorers. They grouped people with common interests that were under-appreciated in distant capitals. The borders are not flawless, but they continue to contain coherent communities. Each colony stood separate from the others, and Britain devolved almost all responsibility for domestic affairs to their parliaments from the 1850s. On 1 January 1901 the six colonies federated as the Commonwealth of Australia. Both the constitution and the Australia Acts 1986 protect state identity. The states and the commonwealth share sovereignty. At federation the states conceded only those responsibilities necessary for federal governance. More have drifted since but blurred distinctions do not negate state sovereignty. State governors, for example, have separate relationships to the Crown; they are not the governor general’s delegates. If the states disappear, whence the commonwealth? The federation only exists because the states exist to comprise it. Transforming Australia into a unitary polity would be complex, requiring potentially unworkable methods to merge the states. The constitution describes an indissoluble federal commonwealth, the exact implications of which are contested. It is no coincidence that agitation for abolition is loudest in NSW and Victoria. They have the least to lose. All states must consent via referendum, and anybody who thinks they will is dreaming. South Australia and Tasmania would fear neglect; such concerns already animate their politics. Queensland and WA assert their sovereignty fiercely – WA attempted to leave the federation in 1933. A state hostile to abolition might even claim the sovereign right to convene its parliament if a national referendum passed. This would be much more absurd than anything existing now. And if abolition were achievable, its desirability remains an open question. Municipal councils would expand in territory and power, losing the accessibility and local character prized by many. Abolition is an impractical proposal that should be put to bed. Australia is a federation of states and will remain so. The real debate is how to make the federation work best, not its extinction.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/04/bob-hawkes-narrative-on-abolishing-the-states-is-nonsense','Bob Hawke\'s narrative on abolishing the states is nonsense | André Brett',401,'commentisfree'),('lifeandstyle/2017/jan/03/no-evidence-sugar-free-diet-soft-drinks-aid-weight-loss-study','Soft drinks made with artificial sweeteners, such as diet colas, do not help people lose weight and may be as big a part of the obesity problem as the full-sugar versions, academics have said. A paper by researchers at Imperial College London and two universities in Brazil contends that artificially sweetened beverages, often called diet drinks, are just as big a problem as those containing sugar. There is no evidence they help people lose weight, they say, possibly because people assume they can eat more because their drinks are low in sugar. The report says the combined factors of what goes into artificially sweetened drinks, how they are consumed, and their environmental impact mean that “far from helping to solve the global obesity crisis [they are] a potential risk factor for highly prevalent chronic diseases”. Sugar-sweetened drinks, including sports beverages, have been identified as one of the major causes of obesity. Many countries, including Mexico and France, have introduced sugar taxes to try to reduce consumption, and the UK plans to do so next year. Many manufacturers are looking to boost sales of drinks containing artificial sweeteners in order to escape the levy. Such products already account for 25% of the global soft drinks market. Prof Christopher Millett, senior investigator at Imperial’s School of Public Health, said: “A common perception, which may be influenced by industry marketing, is that because ‘diet’ drinks have no sugar they must be healthier and aid weight loss when used as a substitute for full-sugar versions. However, we found no solid evidence to support this.” The paper, published in the journal PLoS Medicine, is a commentary on the research done so far into artificially sweetened beverages promoted as healthier alternatives and the impact on weight. It says the evidence does not suggest they help with weight loss, although they probably do not cause people to put on weight. Some studies show no weight loss; others show a small loss, but those studies were not always well done and were often funded by the soft drinks industry, the authors say. Maria Carolina Borges, the first author of the study, from the Federal University of Pelotas, in Brazil, said: “The lack of solid evidence on the health effects of ASBs [artificially sweetened beverages] and the potential influence of bias from industry-funded studies should be taken seriously when discussing whether ASBs are adequate alternatives to SSBs [sugar-sweetened beverages].” The paper argues that “given their negligible nutritional benefits and potential detrimental health impacts”, the environmental impact of manufacturing artificially sweetened drinks should be taken into account. It takes 150-300 litres of water to make one litre of drink, it says, and there is considerable solid waste and cumulative chemical pollution. Prof Carlos Monteiro, a co-author, from the University of São Paulo, said: “Taxes and regulation on SSBs and not ASBs will ultimately promote the consumption of diet drinks rather than plain water, the desirable source of hydration for everyone.” The British Soft Drinks Association dismissed the paper. Its director general, Gavin Partington, said: “Contrary to the claims made in this article, scientific research shows that low-calorie sweeteners, such as those found in diet drinks, help consumers manage their weight as part of a calorie-controlled diet. “At a time when we are trying to encourage people to reduce their overall calorie intake it is extremely unhelpful that products that contain no sugar, let alone calories, are demonised without evidence.” He added: “It’s worth bearing in mind that the UK soft drinks sector is the only category in which sugar is consistently falling year on year – over 17% since 2012.” Global beverage companies have been investing in soft drinks, flavoured water, juices and ready-to-drink tea and coffee containing artificial sweeteners in response to the obesity crisis and the outcry over sugar. The World Health Organisation has said sugar should not be more than 10% of people’s energy intake, and preferably lower than 5%. On Tuesday the supermarket chain Sainsbury’s announced a 13% cut in the sugar content of its own-brand cereals. The government has asked food manufacturers to reduce the sugar content of their products by 5% by the end of this year. Sainsbury’s said it had also removed all illustrated characters from its cereal boxes as part of a commitment to responsible marketing to children. Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: “Our extensive evidence review showed swapping to low or no sugar drinks goes some way to managing calorie intake and weight. “It’s especially so for young people as they consume three times the amount recommended, mostly from soft drinks. However, maintaining a healthy weight takes more than just swapping one product for another. Calories consumed should match calories used, so looking at the whole diet is very important.”','https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jan/03/no-evidence-sugar-free-diet-soft-drinks-aid-weight-loss-study','No evidence sugar-free soft drinks aid weight loss – study',402,'lifeandstyle'),('australia-news/2017/jan/04/heartless-core-autistic-man-chased-centrelink-debt-collectors','A call from a private debt collector was the first 21-year-old Jack Rogerson learned of his $3,000 debt to Centrelink. Rogerson, who is autistic, was confused and unsure of how to explain himself. He began preparing to pay the debt recovery firm Dun &amp; Bradstreet, which has a $10.8m contract with Centrelink to chase down welfare recipients for years-old debts. But before doing so he mentioned the call to his mother, who intervened. Nicole Rogerson, who is the head of Autism Awareness Australia, said finding out that her son was being “heavied” by debt collectors was a huge wake-up call. She fears others with an intellectual disability are at risk of paying money they may not owe. “I’m so concerned for families who are a lot more vulnerable than we are,” she said. “Jack’s at least got two parents and we can work this out for him. It will be horrible having to deal with Centrelink but at least we can do it, and we will because it’s the right thing to do. “This hard line of the government is just heartless to the core.” Her son’s debt related to three months when he was on a disability benefit, just before he began working as a chef’s apprentice. He was not working while claiming from Centrelink during those three months, and his mother said the debt was false, but she and her son were lucky enough to be in a position to fight it. The family’s circumstances appear consistent with others who have complained about Centrelink’s new automated compliance system, which relies on data-matching reported income with information held by the Australian Taxation Office. The system, in some cases, is averaging a person’s yearly income across the 26 Centrelink fortnightly reporting periods, making them ineligible to receive benefits at any point. Centrelink staff appear to be aware of the problem. In an operational webpage providing guidance on what documents are acceptable to verify income, Centrelink says: If employment is for a part of a year only, averaging over 12 months will not result in a correct result if the customer should have received a full rate at other times of the year. Dun &amp; Bradstreet is one of three debt collection firms being used by Centrelink. The other two appear to be Probe Group and Australian Receivables, which are both on $2.5m contracts. The government continues to defend the system. The social services minister, Christian Porter, said on Tuesday it was working “incredibly well” and gave individuals a fair chance to respond when discrepancies were detected. “What you’re saying to me is that if people over-respond, or if people find it inconvenient, then the response to that from a government should be to not do it,” Porter said. “Now, if we don’t do it, that is $4bn worth of taxpayers’ money that got wrongfully paid that can never be recouped. “I think that this is about as reasonable a process as you could possibly derive.” Other advocates fear that the new system may be particularly difficult for those with a disability. Advocacy for Inclusion’s chief executive, Christina Ryan, said some people with a disability may not be able to read the letters sent by Centrelink. “It’s particularly concerning for people who have no real resources on many levels to actually respond,” she said. “And the part that worries me is that this is how people can be bullied into paying a debt that they don’t actually have and causing themselves significant financial hardship.”','https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/jan/04/heartless-core-autistic-man-chased-centrelink-debt-collectors','\'Heartless to the core\': autistic man chased by Centrelink debt collector',403,'australia-news'),('sport/2017/jan/03/johan-goosen-racing-92-legal-action','Racing 92 are launching civil and criminal actions against the South Africa centre Johan Goosen, claiming breach of contract after the 24-year-old left Paris last month saying he was retiring from the game and returning home to take up a job as a commercial director. The French champions issued a strongly worded statement saying they found it inconceivable a player would end his playing career while at his peak. There have been reports in France that if the Montpellier owner, Mohed Altrad, who has made his fortune in scaffolding, succeeds in taking over Gloucester he will look to sign the 13-cap Goosen, who would not be able to join another French club for 18 months because Racing hold his registration to play in the Top&nbsp;14. Racing said Goosen, who was named the French league’s best player of the year last season, is still employed by the club. “He remains bound to the club by a contract lasting four years,” the club said. “His residence, company car, locker and place in the dressing room all remain at his disposal. “In response to his behaviour Racing&nbsp;92 is forced to initiate several legal proceedings aimed at enforcing its rights and redressing the harm done to the club. Racing&nbsp;92 believes the club is a victim of blatant fraud which Johan Goosen, his associates and various advisers must answer for in court.” The club said various civil proceedings would be taken out to recoup advance image rights payments and compensation for not fulfilling his contract – Goosen has not been deregistered for the European Champions Cup, which resumes next week – and a complaint would be lodged with a French employment tribunal seeking compensation for “significant damage to the club”. Racing’s statement concluded: “A criminal complaint will also be filed, as the open-ended employment contract produced by Johan Goosen and signed by one of his friends and business associates appears to constitute a phoney document, given it is not conceivable a player puts an end to his sporting career while at its peak and accepts a position in a South African company for a salary 10 times less than what he was earning as a rugby player at Racing&nbsp;92 (around £400,000 a year). “Full light must be shed on the responsibility of the various people who advised Johan Goosen in taking this aberrant and fraudulent strategy, and to this extent, there are grounds for wondering how Johan Goosen is being supported financially given the numerous commitments and investments he has to meet.” It is the second strongly worded statement issued by Racing this season after the club rounded on various sections of the media after the appearance of players, including the former New Zealand fly-half Dan Carter, before a panel following a drugs test last year.','https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/03/johan-goosen-racing-92-legal-action','Racing 92 launch legal action against Johan Goosen over Springbok’s departure',404,'sport'),('business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/jan/03/richard-cousins-exit-from-tesco-board-is-a-mystery','Richard Cousins’ arrival as a non-executive director of Tesco was greeted with much fanfare in October 2014. It came soon after the supermarket group confessed to a £263m overstatement of profits. A beleaguered board required reinforcement and Cousins was a perfect heavyweight appointment. He is the successful no-nonsense boss of Compass Group and came with his own crisis-fighting experience, having been recruited by the contract caterer after a 2006 scandal involving a UN contract. Nobody was surprised when Tesco bumped Cousins up to be its senior independent director (SID) last April. Now he has resigned from the board with immediate effect. Why? No one wants to offer a proper explanation, which is feeble. Non-executive posts can run for 10 years. If the senior person in the role has quit after two, shareholders expect better than a brush-off. They, after all, paid Cousins’ £115,000 fees last year and the SID is meant to have a direct connection with the owners. Cousins, it might be said, is the resigning type. Five months before joining Tesco’s board he left Reckitt Benckiser’s, saying the role was consuming too much of his time. That is unlikely to be the reason this time. If it was, it would be stated, as would any other innocuous cause. Shareholders must assume a serious falling out. In as far as anything can be read into the Tesco chairman John Allan’s vague scripted remarks, a clash of some variety seems likely. Allen thanked Cousins “for his strong contributions to the deliberations of the Tesco board”. Did he mean too strong for the tastes of the chief executive, Dave Lewis? The loss of a single non-executive director, even a senior one, is not a disaster, but Cousins’ departure comes at an intriguing moment. Under Lewis, Tesco has been rightly praised for halting its loss of market share. The restoration of customer-first trading principles, however, has done little for the share price, which had a good 2016 but is still roughly where it was when Lewis arrived, also in 2014. Nor is there even a promise of when dividends will restart. Maybe Cousins, like some Tesco shareholders, was frustrated by the slow pace of recovery. In praise of ‘Fat Cat Wednesday’ The beauty of the High Pay Centre’s “Fat Cat Wednesday” calculation is that the methodology is easy to understand and the result striking. Last year the median chief executive of a FTSE 100 company earned £3.97m, which was about £1,000 an hour – if one makes a few generous assumptions about how many long hours and weekends were worked and how few holidays were taken. So it takes about 28 hours, or two and a half working days, to reach £28,200, the average earnings for a UK full-time employee. We should not be surprised by the result, because it roughly tallies with the 129:1 pay ratio that prevailed between FTSE 100 chief executives and the average worker in the same firms in 2015, the last year in which it is possible to make informed estimates. Expressing the numbers in terms of hourly earnings merely brings the bald data to life. Opponents of compulsory publication of pay ratios for individual companies will probably hate the exercise. They keep telling us that pay ratios are too crude and they would probably say the same about Fat Cat Wednesday. After a couple of decades of discontent over boardroom pay, however, a touch of coarseness is no bad thing. Twenty years ago, the pay ratio of workers to bosses was less than 50:1. The increase has happened in part because executives’ pay schemes, stuffed with annual bonuses and medium and long-term incentive plans, have become so complicated. Crude measures at least cut through the self-serving corporate noise about “pay for performance” and give a real-world readout. Theresa May, a declared fan of the mandatory publication of pay ratios, should take note. The prime minister should resist the corporate lobbying against the proposal and insist on the fullest possible disclosure. Pay ratios alone will not reverse inflation in boardroom pay, but they do tell a tale in a way that strikes a chord and require companies to explain their thinking on pay to the outside world. Cherry-picked takeover target The world of industrial cranes and cherry pickers has never seen a takeover scrap like it. Little old Lavendon, a company on few investment radars a couple of months ago, has been the subject of an extraordinary tit-for-tat bid battle between TVH of Belgium and Loxam of France. The first bid was at 205p a share in November, but on Tuesday TVH upped the stakes to 261p with its third increased offer. The Lavendon share price, at 266p, says Loxam will be back. All this for a company whose shares were 140p before the fun started. Brexit and the weakness of sterling only partly explain the action. It is now clear that Lavendon was grossly undervalued by the market. Credit is due to M&amp;G for sitting on its 18% stake throughout the saga. Others have sold out to TVH, which now has a 20% stake, but M&amp;G has stuck with its holding and now, if it wishes, can scoop top price.','https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2017/jan/03/richard-cousins-exit-from-tesco-board-is-a-mystery','Richard Cousins\' departure from Tesco board is a mystery',405,'business'),('us-news/2017/jan/03/donald-trump-new-years-eve-2017-joseph-cinque-mob','Donald Trump rang in 2017 at a New Year’s Eve bash at his Mar-a-Lago estate with Joseph Cinque – reportedly a convicted felon who goes by the nickname “Joey No Socks”. Cinque, a longtime acquaintance of Trump’s, can be seen grinning on stage as the president-elect reads off a list of accomplishments he intends to achieve in office. In a video of the speech, which was obtained and published by the Palm Beach Daily News, Cinque, wearing a tuxedo, claps and cheers loudly – even pumping his arms in the air when Trump pledges to repeal the Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act. On Trump’s other side, a man awkwardly holds what appears to be a gilded statue of a bald eagle. Cinque runs the American Academy of Hospitality Sciences, a company whose primary action is to bestow Star Diamond awards, “the most prestigious award of true excellence in hospitality”, according to its website. Often on the receiving end of these coveted awards: Trump. According to an analysis by the Associated Press, more than a dozen Trump golf courses, hotels, casinos and private clubs have been awarded the Star Diamond. As recently as last May, the Associated Press reported, Trump was listed on the group’s website as an “ambassador extraordinaire”, and in a 2009 video tribute to Cinque, Trump said: “There’s nobody like him. He’s a special guy.” Trump’s relationship with Cinque is well documented on the company’s website, which includes videos featuring photographs of him with Trump posing with various awards over the past several years. One company video features a montage of photos set to Frank Sinatra hits, including one of Cinque posing with Trump and former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani in what appears to be a boardroom. The video also features photos with Bill Clinton, Muhammad Ali and a number of beauty pageant queens. When asked about him in May, Trump told the Associated Press that he did not know Cinque well and was not aware of Cinque’s reported criminal conviction. “If a guy’s going to give you an award, you take it,” Trump said. “You don’t tend to look up his whole life story.” The Trump transition team did not respond to a request by the Guardian to clarify the nature of the president-elect’s relationship with Cinque. The American Academy of Hospitality Sciences has also been contacted for comment. A New York Magazine profile from April 1995 described Cinque as a “small-time mobster, a scam artist and an art fence” who “used to be friends with John Gotti” – the former boss of the Gambino crime family. The profile, titled The Preppy Don, went on: “In most cities, such qualifications might be an impediment to Cafe Society, but New York plays by its own set of rules.” The profile says he was arrested in 1989 on felony charges when police retrieved a “gallery’s worth of stolen art from his apartment”, including two prints by Marc Chagall that were valued at more than $20,000 apiece that had recently been stolen from New York’s Center Art Gallery. A contemporaneous news report by UPI said that despite obtaining a warrant, Cinque wouldn’t allow the police to enter his “posh apartment” overlooking Central Park. Officers broke down the door with a battering ram and discovered an “art lover’s paradise”. Cinque pleaded guilty to the felony charge and didn’t serve time in prison, according to New York magazine.

But it seems the communal custom is dying out, with television ratings on Christmas Day last month falling to their lowest level on record. The programme that drew the most viewers was the BBC’s Christmas special of Call the Midwife, with the drama transported to South Africa as the nuns and nurses tried to save a hospital from closing down. Although 9.2 million people tuned in, according to the consolidated ratings that include online streaming, it was the smallest audience number for the most watched show on Christmas Day since ratings began in 1981. Heidi Thomas, the show’s creator and writer, said: “We are always so proud to be part of BBC1’s Christmas Day schedule, and absolutely delighted that so many people joined us on this year’s journey to South Africa.” Overall, the BBC dominated the battle for Christmas ratings. BBC1 had eight of the 10 most watched shows on 25 December, while in contrast, ITV, suffering from the absence of a Downton Abbey Christmas special, had only Coronation Street and Emmerdale in the top 10. The second most popular festive programme was the BBC comedy sitcom Mrs Brown’s Boys, which attracted 9 million viewers. It was followed by the Strictly Come Dancing festive special, which had an audience of 8.9 million, a testament to the show’s revived popularity this year. The Christmas episode saw the Kiss FM DJ Melvin Odoom triumph alongside his professional dance partner, Janette Manrara. Another major draw was the Great Christmas Bake Off, as viewers watched judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood, and presenters Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc, together on the BBC for the final time before the show moves to Channel 4. This year’s Queen’s speech was watched by 7.7 million people, up from 7.2 million last year. Seemingly gone are the days when Wallace and Gromit: A Matter of Loaf and Death drew a viewing figure as high as 16.2 million, in 2008. Last year was only the second year on record when no programme drew more than 10 million viewers, and the viewing figures are a far cry from the 1980s, when the average audience for festive TV was 18.5 million. The single biggest Christmas TV audience in history was in 1989, when 21.8 million tuned in for the UK premiere of the film Crocodile Dundee. Nonetheless, the BBC’s dominance of the Christmas TV ratings rounds off a successful year for the broadcaster. Thanks to the massive popularity of the Great British Bake Off and Strictly Come Dancing, the BBC aired 31 of the 40 most watched television shows of 2016. Bake Off drew 16 million viewers, including those who watched on catch-up services, while David Attenborough’s Planet Earth II had an audience of 13.1 million, making it the most watched nature programme in 15 years. Another BBC success of the festive period was the new episode of Sherlock, which pulled in 8.1 million viewers on New Year’s Day, making it the day’s most watched show. It was also a successful night for the BBC in the United States, with the Doctor Who Christmas special breaking the record for the highest number of viewers for BBC America, a total of 1.7 million.

A travelling salesman named Ray Kroc, played in the forthcoming biopic The Founder by Michael Keaton, sells milkshake machines to restaurants all over the US. Then he discovers an extraordinary little place in California called McDonald’s, run by the McDonald brothers, who have revolutionised the fast-food business with menus limited to burgers, fries and soda, walk-up counters, huge grills and fryers for speedy, short-order volume. In a blinding flash, Kroc sees how the brothers can franchise their operation around the country. They could be an American church, as ubiquitous as decent people’s houses flying the stars’n’stripes. When we saw Ray in his scuzzy hotel room, listening to a self-motivation LP on a portable record player, we could have guessed he would have corporate-imperial ambitions. Might The Founder come to be seen as the first example of Trump-era cinema? After all, poor Ray, with his how-to-win-friends-and-influence-people LP, would be a prime candidate for Trump University. And it wasn’t long ago that McDonald’s was shorthand for evil big money in the cinema. In 2004 Morgan Spurlock made a documentary called Super Size Me, about Big Mac gluttony and the profit motive. But The Founder is basically sweet on a great American adventure. It’s the Birth of a Salesman. In Andrea Arnold’s American Honey, Shia LaBeouf plays Jake, a guy who recruits rootless teens to sell semi-fraudulent magazine subscriptions. He models his trousers and braces explicitly on Donald Trump. He’s not a thousand miles away from fiction’s greatest Trump fan, the serial killer Patrick Bateman in Bret Easton Ellis’s novel American Psycho. If you think there is no such thing as Trump cinema, consider this: the president-elect’s controversial treasury secretary nominee (and former Goldman Sachs honcho) Steven Mnuchin is a hugely powerful movie investor, with executive producer credits including Mad Max: Fury Road, Collateral Beauty, Inherent Vice, Sully, The Lego Ninjago Movie, Midnight Special, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and many more. Mnuchin even has an acting cameo as a banker in Warren Beatty’s forthcoming Howard Hughes film, which has the very Trumpian title of Rules Don’t Apply. (Mnuchin is a producer on that, too.) So Mnuchin really is Trump cinema. He has technically stepped back from showbiz, handing over his RatPac-Dune company to fellow producers Brett Ratner and James Packer, but there’s nothing to stop him returning. Writers with anti-Trump movie projects might well thoughtfully bear in mind how much they could annoy a powerful Hollywood producer who is also treasury secretary. In his banking days, Mnuchin was known as the “foreclosure king” for buying up bad mortgages and evicting homeowners. So perhaps the film he should have produced was Ramin Bahrani’s 99 Homes, with Michael Shannon as the sinister realtor making cash out of the home-loan crisis. Waiting for Trump to trickle down to the cinema in a larger sense could take a while. Even if The Donald scores two terms, he could be gone before anything comes through the pipeline. But the point is that cinema has always been in tune with Trump. It’s an intensely capitalist business, mythologising capitalism, famously run by (and often celebrating) charming/horrible male monsters letting their id run riot. Billy Bob Thornton did so in Bad Santa 2; Robert De Niro will be a grumpy older comic in Art Linson’s The Comedian. The cinema screen has long been populated by nobodies making it big, or somebodies making it small, but gaining emotional victories along the way: it’s full of success stories and satirical nightmares about male idiots fluking their way to the top. A naive, learning-impaired gardener called Chance mouths banal platitudes that get mistaken for profundity and take him to the heart of political power. A goofy lookalike of the US president called Dave is called upon to impersonate the ailing C-in-C permanently, despite being hilariously unqualified and unsuitable. A star newsreader has a breakdown live on TV and incites everyone to yell: “I’m as mad as hell and I’m not going to take it any more!” A rackety Broadway producer stages a crass, pro-Hitler musical that needs to fail to conceal his profits from the taxman, but it becomes a terrifying success. A plutocrat with aspirations to high office bullyingly promises a special prosecutor to get his opponent, “Boss” Jim Gettys, locked up, but also has an enigmatic wound, deep in his soul, relating to something called Rosebud. Look for Trump motifs in the cinema and they are everywhere. But the man himself is everywhere as well. Actors from Alec Baldwin to Johnny Depp have derisively played him, though not on the big screen: the hair, the red tie, the suit, the snuffly voice. Yet this is how Trump has been playing himself and promoting his celebrity brand. He has done loads of movie cameos, generally as living shorthand for the glitzy razzmatazz of New York City – films such as The Job (in which America’s future grabber-in-chief asks Denis Leary if he is “banging” Liz Hurley) and Two Weeks Notice (he has an acid exchange with Hugh Grant). Politics meshes with Hollywood. They are arguably two wings of the same eternal display of power and prestige – liberalism coexisting uneasily with conservatism. Joe Kennedy (father of JFK) was briefly involved in the movie business in the 1920s, and did not trouble to conceal his antisemitism when he said to a colleague: “Look at that bunch of pants-pressers in Hollywood making themselves millionaires. I could take the whole business away from them.” Conversely, and in fine Joe Kennedy style, Donald Trump contemptuously took the whole business of the Republican party and then the presidency away from the “establishment”. Interestingly, Rupert Murdoch, owner of 20th Century Fox, Fox News and perhaps soon Sky TV, is nowadays a restrained, almost mandarin figure compared with Trump, despite having presided over the populism that was to create him. You could, of course, find a lot of Reagan or post-Reagan cinema – anything with a decent, aw-shucks guy winning out in the end. Forrest Gump is an example (though the rhyme with Donald Trump is unsettling), and I would say also Sully, despite the Mnuchin connection. But it strikes me that quasi-Trump cinema is something different: harsher, more dyspeptic. When Daniel Day-Lewis’s oilman is seen in Paul Thomas Anderson’s There Will Be Blood fanatically hacking away with a pickaxe, and later locked in a strange twilight of mega-rich unhappiness and eccentricity, it is a very Trumpian narrative arc, but perhaps not Trump cinema, exactly, because the man himself isn’t seen as a winner. Perhaps closer is The Social Network, written by Aaron Sorkin and directed by David Fincher, an unbridled capitalist success story about the creation of Facebook, the network that was to mobilise millions of Trump supporters outside the establishment “mainstream media” and of course spread fake news – a development unguessed at in the film. Again, the comparison isn’t exact. Mark Zuckerberg is supposed to be an intimidatingly smart Harvard guy, and the point about Trump is that he does not have these elitist credentials; he is the friend of the dumb. We talk about post-truth; how about post-satire? Sacha Baron Cohen’s creation Borat was allowed to say and do outrageous things, on the understanding that he was horrible. Donald does them unsatirically. Broad comedy in Hollywood now often includes outrageous stuff: drugs, booze, inappropriate behaviour. Hollywood loves Horrible Bosses. Trump campaigners, Trump supporters and Trump activists relentlessly trolling people online might see themselves as comedians, as Will Ferrell wild men. But in the final analysis, Trump is anti-comedy, as shown by the grisly troll Milo Yiannopoulos, who incited online abuse against Ghostbusters star Leslie Jones. Trumpism has the anarchism of Hollywood comedy without the humour or talent. We arguably come back to Peter Finch in Network in 1976, playing the TV star who is promoted as a celebrity ranter, telling people to scream out of their windows that they’re as mad as hell. Those were the days when people could only shout out of their windows. The host of The Apprentice got them to shout into their smartphones and laptops, their screams of futility and alienation amplified and recirculated on social media, and converted into votes. A season of Trump cinema must start with a 40-year anniversary showing of Network.','https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/03/why-a-film-celebrating-mcdonalds-is-the-perfect-start-for-trump-cinema','Why a film celebrating McDonald\'s is the perfect start for Trump cinema',409,'film'),('music/2017/jan/03/parekh-singh-the-pop-princes-at-the-forefront-of-indias-new-wave','Something is buzzing, so Jivraj Singh unplugs a wire from one box and plugs it into another. “Try that?” he says. A note plays, but the buzz can still be heard, and so more wires need to be replugged, until all unwanted scratches of sound vanish. “We spend around 95% of our time trying to eliminate noises,” says Nischay Parekh, sitting behind the synths. Together, they are Parekh &amp; Singh, a dream-pop duo from the eastern Indian city of Kolkata. Ocean, the pair’s debut album, features none of the stereotypical sitars and tablas that dominate India’s music scene. Instead guitarist, vocalist and synth-player Parekh and percussionist Singh produce music that sounds distinctly un-Indian, as though it could have been produced in any part of the world. Rehearsals always start like this, the pair tell me, as they set up the bedroom-turned-practice-chamber in Singh’s family home in an upmarket Kolkata neighbourhood, where abandoned colonial mansions squat among new high rises. Listening to their album, released by UK indie label Peacefrog, you could never pick apart the many layers of instrumental tracks that produce their effortlessly crisp, neo-psychedelic sound. But watching them in the flesh reveals the feat of assemblage, as guitars, synths, drums and various other musical toys and gadgets work together to produce their light, whimsical melodies. “We’re putting out 24 tracks of sound at the same time,” says Parekh. “That’s 12 tracks each. Our music doesn’t sound very electronic, but we use a lot of the same tools electronic musicians use. Because it’s only two of us, we have to use technology.” Singh steps in: “No, technology uses us.” Parekh &amp; Singh: the name sounds more like a law firm than a pop band, but it suits the pair, who wear brightly coloured tailored suits on stage and in their Wes Anderson-style music videos. Similarly, their air of well-behaved schoolboys seems more suited to an office than to the booze-fuelled parties of India’s nascent indie music scene. Parekh, 23, is the performer and dreamer, switching from keyboards to guitars and vocals, as they start to rehearse for a couple of gigs. He introduces each song with a small story: Ocean’s title track is about navigating difficult relationships; Newbury St is about homesickness; and Je Suis Le Pomme Rouge – inspired by his unsuccessful attempts to learn French through an app – tells the story of the troubadour English king, Richard the Lionheart. After two semesters at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, Parekh dropped out and returned to Kolkata to write and produce his own music. His mother, Sumona, lived in America in the 1970s, and fell in love with the music of Frank Sinatra, the Beatles and the Mamas &amp; the Papas. When she returned to India, she married into a very conservative family, but wanted her son to grow up with the worldview she had benefited from. So, when he was a young boy, she would have her cassette player on all day, blasting everything from Marvin Gaye to Geri Halliwell, singers who had never really been heard in India. Singh often missed school to spend long weekends away with his musician parents, who toured the country performing covers of rock songs. He would sleep on stage next to the band’s drummer as his mother belted out the songs. Despite this, young Jivraj did not want a career in music. “I always wanted to be a documentary-maker and was much more interested in the visual arts, until college. Then I started playing the drums and realised it was just natural for me to make music.” Together, Parekh and Singh represent a new type of Indian: well-travelled, educated and fashionable, with tastes that have expanded beyond classical folk music or the mass appeal Bollywood song-and-dance numbers to include a western indie repertoire. But despite the international influence, the dreamlike quality of their music and videos is firmly rooted in their hometown of Kolkata, a city frozen in time after decades of communist rule, where shops close not at the end of the day, but whenever the owners decide they’ve done enough to deserve a hot meal and a nap, where strangers stop each other for casual roadside conversations. Their pastel-coloured suits are handmade by local family firm Barkat Ali &amp; Sons, who established themselves making uniforms for Indian soldiers during the second world war. Their first video, for I Love You Baby, I Love You Doll, was shot in an old palace just outside the city. For Parekh, Kolkata was always central to his music. On the single Philosophize, he sings: “I’ve got a New York state of mind / In Indian standard time.” He says: “I liked living in America, and I liked not being in India. But I knew I had to come back if I wanted to make music. Because all the music I like, and I listen to, has always come from the musicians’ hometowns.” The pair went to the same school, La Martiniere for Boys, but a six-year age gap meant they only met as teenagers, through friends. Now, they barely spend a day apart. As they prepare for two concerts, one in Kolkata, the other to an audience of thousands in Pune, the two shuttle between each other’s homes, packing kit, rehearsing scores, and continually teasing each other. Although they’ve been making music together for six years, things only really took off at the beginning of last year when, after a late-night gig in Kolkata, Parekh fired off a round of emails to record companies. “I sent an email with an mp3 of our song Hello to eight or nine companies,” he says as we hurtle through the city’s narrow, palm-lined streets. “People always tell you that’s the one thing you should never do, that it’ll never work, but then two days later we got an email back.” Within weeks, Parekh &amp; Singh had signed a contract and started shooting the video for I Love You Baby. With a budget of just $5,000, the shoot required a lot of DIY: the pair set about scouting locations, getting new suits tailored, and recruiting people to help. “That’s the advantage of working in India,” says Parekh. “You can do a lot with a little. In New York or London, shooting a video like the one we made on that kind of budget is impossible.” The video clocked up more than 200,000 views – a lot for an indie band in India. Emails started flooding in from such countries as Russia, where the band had never expected to find fans. Suddenly, it felt as though they had outgrown India, where their music reaches only a small network of young, urban music fans. At the NH7 weekender festival in Pune, the crowd sways as the sun dips below the horizon. Parekh &amp; Singh’s set includes favourites from the first album and a handful of new songs. A ripple of excitement spreads through the audience as I Love You Baby, I Love You Doll comes on. Afterwards, over a drink, the pair discuss their plan to tour the UK, hoping to make some contacts at the festival who can help. They know they still have a long way to go to win audiences in the west. “I want to play to new crowds, to new cities,” says Parekh. “That’s how you keep the music fresh and interesting.” India has long been a land of dreamers, but generations of indie musicians – Singh’s parents among them – have had to content themselves with playing to niche local audiences. However, the emergence of bands such as Parekh &amp; Singh, who a decade ago would have struggled to get noticed by a foreign label, is a mark of progress – not just for India, but also for the west, which no longer seems so fixated on sitars and tablas. “I did take sitar lessons once,” says Parekh. “And Jivraj can play the tabla. But we just decided to do something different. And so we did.” • Ocean is out now on Peacefrog Records.','https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/03/parekh-singh-the-pop-princes-at-the-forefront-of-indias-new-wave','Parekh & Singh, the pop princes at the forefront of India\'s new wave',410,'music'),('uk-news/2017/jan/03/avian-flu-found-in-backyard-flock-in-welsh-village-pontyberem','A 3km protection zone has been placed around a Welsh village after a backyard flock of chickens and ducks was found to have avian flu. The birds were infected by avian influenza H5N8, which has previously been discovered on a turkey farm in Lincolnshire and a wild duck in Llanelli, south Wales. Christianne Glossop, the chief veterinary officer for Wales, said the small flock at a property in the village of Pontyberem, Carmarthenshire, had been culled. Restrictions were already in place to try to stop the spread of avian flu across mainland Britain, with keepers ranging from large-scale farmers to those with a few chickens or ducks in their garden instructed to keep them away from wild birds. The imposition of a protection zone around Pontyberem means keepers will additionally have to keep records of visitors and of the movement of all poultry and eggs. A 10km surveillance zone has also been introduced. Glossop said: “It is extremely important that birdkeepers practise the very highest levels of biosecurity. Even when birds are housed there remains a risk of infection and keepers of poultry and other captive birds should ensure every effort is made to prevent contact with wild birds. The movement of poultry should be minimised, and clothing and equipment should always be disinfected.” She added: “If you are concerned about the health of your birds you should seek advice from your veterinary surgeon. If you suspect that your birds are showing signs of the disease, you should immediately report it to your local animal and plant health agency office.” The Welsh government’s cabinet secretary for the environment and rural affairs, Lesley Griffiths, said: “This case of avian influenza H5N8 in a backyard flock near Pontyberem in Carmarthenshire follows the findings of infection in wild birds and a confirmed case in Lincolnshire. “It serves to reinforce the need for all birdkeepers, particularly backyard flock keepers, to adhere to the requirements set out in the prevention zone, remain vigilant for signs of disease and practise good biosecurity at all times.” The Welsh government said the advice from Public Health Wales (PHW) was that the risk to public health from the virus was very low and the Food Standards Agency had made clear that avian flu did not pose a food safety risk for UK consumers. It said thoroughly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, were safe to eat. Members of the public are encouraged to report dead wild waterfowl (swans, geese or ducks) or gulls, or five or more dead wild birds of other species in the same location, to the Defra helpline on 03459 335577.','https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/03/avian-flu-found-in-backyard-flock-in-welsh-village-pontyberem','Avian flu found in backyard flock in Welsh village',411,'uk-news'),('society/2017/jan/03/as-the-train-empties-i-worry-ill-be-forgotten-uk-disability-facilities','An award-winning Paralympic athlete, Anne Wafula Strike, has spoken out about being forced to wet herself on a train without an accessible toilet. Wafula Strike, a disabilities campaigner, was on a three-hour journey when the accessible toilet was out of order. Despite feeling humiliated, Wafula Strike said she felt she had to speak out to expose some of the injustice faced by people living with disabilities. “People with disabilities don’t want perfection, we just want the basics and to have our independence. But lack of access and inclusive facilities make us feel as if we are an afterthought,” she said. We asked people with disabilities about their experiences of access to toilets, transport and other public facilities. Here is a selection of our readers’ responses. Chloe Timms, 28, Kent: I’ve had to beg people to find someone to help me get off the train I am a wheelchair user and was born with spinal muscular atrophy. I am a recent masters graduate in creative writing, currently writing a novel. Public toilets are out of the question for me because they don’t suit my needs – if I want to go out for the day then I have no choice but to hang on. Unfortunately it’s a way of life now. A large toilet with a changing table and ceiling hoists are the answer to many disabled people’s prayers, however they are a rare sight. Most toilets just have grab rails and adjustable sinks, though an initiative called Changing Places is campaigning to change this. A lot of hotels also might meet the box tick of “accessible” but rarely have completely suitable facilities, meaning trips are a military operation of organisation. I look for hotels with ceiling hoists – of which there are [fewer] than 20 in the entire country. Assistance at train stations is also hit and miss. Some stations are good at having staff there ready and waiting with a ramp but other stations are less good. It’s stressful because I mostly travel alone. There are times I’ve had to beg members of the public to find someone to help me get off the train, as even though I’ve booked well in advance there is no one waiting with a ramp to get me off the train. I worry, as the train empties and I’m left alone, that I will be forgotten about. Station accessibility is still a huge issue for old Victorian stations. My local station is inaccessible on one side meaning I have to travel a further five miles by car to use the train. Shona Louise, 19, Hull: the space was occupied by people and luggage I was recently on a train to London. As a powerchair user I have worries every time I use public transport because of the possibilities of what could go wrong. When boarding the train we found that the space was occupied by people and luggage, luckily they moved without too many dirty looks. Once I got into the space the train filled up around me. Some time into the journey I needed to use the toilet but a quick look round the corner showed me that it wasn’t going to be possible. The train was so packed. Luckily my boyfriend had his crutches with him and I can walk a little so I had to make my way there like that. Without my ability to walk a little and his crutches though I dread to think what would have happened. Rachel George, Cornwall: even attending hospital and doctors’ appointments is difficult I am the mother of a child with disabilities and I am actively campaigning – and writing about my efforts – for better toilet provision. Facilities for disabled people are often well below what is needed. Legislation is old and people hide behind meeting the minimum required standards. My son is able to use the toilet but needs a hoist to lift him from his wheelchair and a changing table to lay him down on to sort clothes and switch to his toilet sling before hoisting him to the toilet. Very few places have these facilities and I’ve been working to change that. We no longer use public transport, last time we needed to use a bus we couldn’t get on because there was a pushchair in the wheelchair space. The second bus came but also had pushchairs in the wheelchair space. Luckily we were able to get on the third bus but this should not happen. My son cannot stand up at all, pushchairs can be folded. A lack of accessible toilets also makes public transport really hard. We need to cut down travel time as much as possible in order to make the most of our time away from home. At our local zoo we cannot get the powered wheelchair inside the disabled toilet and close the door. Even if he could stand, it would be no use to him. We can’t easily go out for meals, or visit the theatre or tourist attractions. Even attending hospital and doctors’ appointments is difficult. These facilities are vital to hundreds of thousands of people in this country. Yragael Drouet, 41, London: my friends had to lift me up stairs into a restaurant I am a 41-year-old man living in Hackney, London, who uses a manual wheelchair full-time due to spina bifida. As I do not drive I use public transport frequently. Most of the time things work fine. People vacate the wheelchair space when asked on buses and people move on other forms of transport. However, sometimes it goes disastrously wrong. For instance, on New Year’s Eve my partner and I were on our way back home via Woodford, north-east London. Woodford [tube] is accessible on both platforms but you have to access the southbound platform via an underpass. Now, this is normally fine but on this occasion the gates to that platform where closed with only an intercom. I pressed [the button for the] intercom but the disembodied voice didn’t understand my situation. I lost the connection. So I sent my partner to find someone who eventually came to open the gate. There was little or no consideration of what Transport for London would do if a disabled passenger wanted to use the southbound train on their own. Without a non-disabled person there would have been great difficulty. Restaurants can also be hard to access. We went out for dinner last night and the place we ate at had two big steps. My friends had to lift me up them but without their help it would have been impossible to get in. The legislation isn’t strong enough – just as it isn’t on public transport – to protect people with disabilities. Tricia Williams, 66, South Yorkshire: I’ve ended up stuck in aisles or knocking down displays when Christmas shopping I have fibromyalgia, asthma and osteoarthritis – this means it’s variable how far I can walk. I fall over easily and use a mobility scooter. Going shopping is always an interesting experience, particularly coming up to Christmas. At this time of year a large number of shops fill their aisles with extra displays which makes it hard to move around. I have ended up stuck in aisles before or knocking down displays. I never do this deliberately but I rarely regret it given how hard they are to navigate. Not being able to find a dropped curb also makes life harder. In Lincoln recently I detoured a quarter of a mile up the road before I could cross because of this. I couldn’t find a single place to get over the road. It was pouring with rain at the time too and I ended up 20 minutes late for appointment. Going anywhere requires a lot of planning. I usually look up routes first on [Google] Street View.','https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/03/as-the-train-empties-i-worry-ill-be-forgotten-uk-disability-facilities','\'I worry I\'ll be forgotten on the train\': our readers\' experiences of accessible facilities',412,'society'),('environment/2017/jan/03/do-david-attenboroughs-programmes-help-or-hinder-the-natural-world','It takes a brave man to take a shot at a national treasure, and they don’t come any more treasured than David Attenborough, so hats off to Martin Hughes-Games for bravery (Why Planet Earth II should have been taxed, 2 January). But I fear he’s wrong. He says programmes like Planet Earth II lull us “into a false sense of security” as wildlife species are decimated across the globe. That is almost certainly correct, but one thing we’ve learned from last year’s EU referendum is that ordinary people just don’t listen to “experts” lecturing them about unfolding, manmade disasters. Planet Earth II, with its beauty and grandeur, and, yes, entertainment value, takes a subtle approach worthy of the most sophisticated advertising campaign: it says, look at this marvellous planet, do you really want to allow its destruction? Peter Lyth Hockerton, Nottinghamshire • At last, someone has dared to say it. I&nbsp;strongly agree with Martin Hughes-Games with reference to the series Planet Earth I and II. Presenting these programmes was a man who has integrity, presence and an attractive air of authority. People admire him and listen to him. Sir David Attenborough was (and is) in an almost unique position to tell it as it is, not how we would all like it to be. These nature programmes were brilliantly produced with extremely skilful photography and, yes, it was great entertainment. But unfortunately it told a very cosy story with scant allusion to what is really happening. Ignorance, greed, unsupportable population growth of our species and a curious assumption that we can trash the planet without consequences. There is only one point on which I would disagree with Hughes-Games. In 100 years’ time, I don’t believe anyone will be thinking or caring about wildlife. By then, it may well be apparent that the journey towards our own extinction had begun in earnest. Probably far too late to exit la-la land. Carol Knight Tisbury, Wiltshire • Martin Hughes-Games’ claim that Planet Earth II has done nothing to further global conservation gets to the heart of the problem with the BBC Natural History Unit, that its programmes are made with money, ratings and global sales in mind rather than conservation. It is a sad fact that in over 50 years of making wonderful wildlife programmes, it has never made a globally successful big budget series about our destruction of the natural world, despite the unit generating huge profits for the BBC. This has been a big disappointment to the global conservation movement who regularly bring the issue up privately but are reluctant to criticise the BBC publicly. In September the BBC appointed Julian Hector as the head of the unit, a producer who has made his name making very traditional wildlife programmes but who also made the Ivory Wars with Panorama, a hard-hitting programme about the decline of the elephant. It is exactly this type of unique partnership that the BBC Natural History Unit now needs to invest in, and to make it happen conservation organisations should write to Hector in support of Hughes-Games’ idea of a “conservation tax” on its programmes. Nicholas Milton Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire • Congratulations to Martin Hughes-Games for putting his head above the parapet in criticising the wonderfully produced and fascinating Attenborough series as “escapist wildlife fantasy”. I&nbsp;have been a professional biologist for 40 years, but am still not sure what “wildlife” is. I think it harks back to Rousseau and romantic ideas of primitiveness. There was just about no ecosystem unaffected by humans before anthropogenic climate change came as a “double whammy”. I have also occasionally criticised the philosophy behind these series to my biologist colleagues, and am generally faced with disbelief. My criticism is different. The programmes follow the Animal Planet view of biodiversity and nature, where living things are almost entirely made up of large animals and land plants. The vast majority of the genetic biodiversity on earth is microscopic, and the former view is overwhelmingly widespread but completely skewed. Of the dozens of major groups of living things, animals are one and land plants are part of another. I would like to offer two sets of New Year challenges. First, to David Attenborough and his team, to produce a similarly wonderful series on Microscopic Life on Earth. Second, to top billionaire entrepreneurs and futurologists (Mr Branson and Mr Musk, are you listening?). We can now buy simple “digital microscopes” for about £100 that can easily view insect parts. Within the next couple of years can you make widely available a digital compound microscope for less than £50, which can view single-celled organisms? Every home should have one. That can be followed a few years later with a home DNA sequencer, so that the 2027 Christmas party game can be: how many different types of living things do you have in your kitchen/plantpots/toenails/pond? John J Bolton Professor of biological sciences, University of Cape Town • So Martin Hughes-Games has gained publicity for himself by traducing David Attenborough: how shabby. Having just watched Islands on DVD, I hardly recognise the picture Hughes-Games gives. The subtext throughout David Attenborough’s commentary is the fragility of all ecosystems and, in the case of an island crab population decimated by ants, he actually states in so many words that humans have introduced the problem and will have to find the solution. . Joanna Bazley London • Martin Hughes-Games cites humankind’s insatiable need for space as the prime factor behind wildlife extinctions. It was a pity that neither his article or your accompanying story on the same day linked it with humankind’s equivalent need for contraception to be freely available. Impoverished countries cannot become better off while their birthrates are too high. Some of our own reluctance to accept refugees surely has to do with our own loss of countryside and wildlife. We should look to see, first, whether planned cuts to local authority finding threaten our own family planning services; second, whether all charities serving third world countries include it where relevant; and, thirdly, how much more international aid could be given to it and maternal and child health services. It is not often that so many problems could be eased by one, and such an easily provided, solution. Helen Haran St Albans, Hertfordshire • Martin Hughes-Games makes an important point about the “fantasy” view of the natural world. I would like to add two points. If programme-makers are going to adopt a more realistic and pessimistic tone at times, then please also tell us what we as individuals can do to help. I can no longer watch natural history programmes because I feel hopeless and helpless, which isn’t a very productive situation. I’d also like to make the rather obvious point that it’s not just cheetahs and giraffes that we should worry about. Each&nbsp;time we in the UK turn grass, soil and woodland into brick and concrete we&nbsp;too leave less room for the bees, rooks, moles and their food supplies. Neil Blessitt Bristol • Martin Hughes-Games is extremely critical of the BBC production Planet Earth II for not emphasising the disastrous worldwide mass extinction taking place. He makes the extraordinary claim that these programmes are “a significant contributor to the planet-wide extinction of wildlife we’re presiding over”. There is no scientific evidence to support this statement. Others claim that such amazing programmes can increase people’s interest in conservation but Mr Hughes-Games says that “the scientific evidence shows this is nonsense”. The idea that blame for the complex issue of destruction of habitat and the loss of species can be attributed to TV wildlife shows is in itself a profoundly unscientific concept. This is at best, speculation on his part. In fact, most wildlife productions over the past few decades have more than emphasised the depressing loss of our natural world. So why does it continue? Perhaps just giving people depressing statistics about this disaster has not been helpful. Making them feel guilty, miserable and helpless may in fact demotivate and cause loss of interest. It seems to me that to enable people to act, they need to be inspired and Planet Earth II certainly achieved that. After the inspiration, you can then start to mobilise. Only with positive messages can we turn this around.

Many of these agreeable places to live were destroyed by the dismemberment of our industrial sector, or submerged by building on every plot of land until they disappeared into an urban mass. How many decayed or decaying homes remain in the abandoned towns of old industrial areas of Britain? The nation would be better served if our energies were devoted to recovering abandoned industrial sites, renovating repairable existing properties, or clearing away what is derelict and building on recovered land. The problem with the Tory plan is that it is the product of the old mining culture. Work out a seam and move on, leaving an industrial scar nobody wants. The Tories and the developers are not building a new Britain. They are mining what is left of Britain’s agricultural heritage. Martin London Henllan, Denbighshire • If they are to be more than commuter dormitories, the 14 new garden villages need to be designed to accommodate home-based work. There is currently a widespread blindness to this working practice and its social and spatial consequences. Layers of ideology and policy, compacted over a century, have pushed it into the shadows. Building to meet the needs of this rapidly growing population would increase neighbourhood connectivity and stimulate the local economy. It would also contribute to the environmental credentials of the new settlements by reducing commuting and intensifying the use of the overall building stock. Dr Frances Holliss London Metropolitan University • I am delighted that one of the government’s garden villages, which is already under construction, is being built at Longcross, near Chertsey. No doubt prices will be similar to those at nearby Virginia Gate, where terraced houses are available from £899,995. This will make such a difference to people such as the nurses and care assistants at St Peter’s Hospital, also nearby, who struggle to find somewhere to live. Robert Walls Camberley, Surrey • It is right that Deenethorpe garden village in Northamptonshire will have a village green. Every garden village should have a village green, but it must&nbsp;not be merely in name. The green must be registered under the Commons&nbsp;Act 2006. Then it is protected for ever and local people have rights of recreation there. A small recompense for local residents who must suffer new development.

But his first “drawback” – that “the Treasury hates any form of earmarked taxation” – is not quite right. What the Treasury objects to (stating awkward facts, as usual) is that hypothecating an existing tax to a particular programme will put an unacknowledged extra burden on other programmes (actually or potentially). The problem with this proposal, as with any referendum, is that a “vote for change” lands the government with the further question: what change? In this case, what new tax? Indirect tax (VAT) is regressive. A straight proportionate increase in income tax looks unfair to low earners and harms incentives to work; but a steep increase in direct tax on rich individuals, or companies, will drive them to base their money, or themselves, abroad. This leaves a progressive tax on the value of fixed assets (land and buildings) – for example a reformed council tax; but how much would a government dare to tax “ordinary” property owners when house prices are already so high? Alan Bailey London • As this winter is indisputably showing, the NHS is slowly dying, and no doctor or nurse can save it. The cure can only be ministered by the British people. As the year turns they must decide whether or not they believe, as they did in 1948, that “illness is neither an indulgence for which people have to pay, nor an offence for which they should be penalised, but a misfortune, the cost of which should be shared by the community” (Aneurin Bevan). If they do, they should indicate through their elected representatives that they are willing to open their wallets and pay the cost through increased taxation. If they do not, they should accept that our health system, the envy of the world, will perish, leaving behind the country’s poorest and most vulnerable.&nbsp; Dr Nicolas Suarez Bristol • At 2pm on New Year’s Eve I phoned Shropdoc, the out-of-hours GP service in Shropshire. I was staying near Clun and my grandson had a severe cold and agonising ear ache. I was told to expect a call from a GP within three hours. In fact they didn’t call until nearly midnight – far too late for anything to be done. Compared with how it once was, the GP service is frighteningly inaccessible and unreliable. The government’s seven-day proposals are completely unachievable without the appointment of thousands of GPs, but these are needed right now to make the current service effective.

Mohammed Yassar Yaqub, 28, was shot dead through his windscreen when armed police swooped on his white Audi sports car on a slip road of the busy motorway in Huddersfield on Monday night. As the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) launched an investigation into the shooting, friends paid tribute to the young father they described as “no angel”. His family’s lawyer released a statement saying: “Mr Yaqub’s family are in shock and are distraught. They would ask the media to respect their privacy at this difficult time. “The family are fully aware that the incident that led to the death of Mr Yaqub is currently being investigated by the IPCC and they do not wish to make any further comment at this stage.” Police said the incident was “related to information received about criminal possession of a firearm” and was not terror related. There were five arrests – three at the scene and two in a simultaneous “related stop” of another vehicle in Bradford, police said. IPCC investigators said “what appears to be a non-police issue firearm” was found in Yaqub’s vehicle after he was shot. A postmortem examination is due to take place on Wednesday and the coroner has been informed, the watchdog said. IPCC commissioner Derrick Campbell added: “My thoughts are with Mr Yaqub’s family and all those affected at this difficult time. Though in its early stages, this investigation is making good progress but will be complex. We will be working hard to establish exactly what happened and would ask for patience while our investigation continues.” The shooting sparked protests by a group of demonstrators on Tuesday night, closing off a busy road in Bradford. Police vans were called when protesters, many wearing scarves or balaclavas to hide their faces, hurled abuse at officers. One demonstrator said: “We are here to let people know what goes on and to show we are upset about yesterday’s killing by the police.” A few missiles were thrown at the dozen or so police vehicles that had blocked the roads around Leeds Road. Officers in riot gear were called as the protest moved towards Bradford city centre. A spokesman for West Yorkshire police said the protest began to disperse at about 10.30pm, adding that there was “minimal disorder” and no arrests. The force added in a statement: “Police empathise with the heightened tensions and engaged with protesters to appeal for calm. They are continuing working with members of the community, partners and local officers to maintain community cohesion and police relations.” The shooting follows a recent surge in gun crime in West Yorkshire, including an incident on Christmas Day when a police officer was fired upon while taking a witness statement outside a nightclub in Bradford. The officer was not injured in the incident, which is not believed to be connected to the shooting of Yaqub. Witnesses described an “absolute hive of police activity” as armed officers swooped on the white Audi near junction 24 of the motorway at about 6pm on Monday, boxing in Yaqub’s vehicle before firing at least three shots through his windscreen. The police investigation continued on Tuesday as armed officers searched a number of properties across Bradford and Huddersfield, including Yaqub’s family home where about 20 grieving relatives and friends had gathered to pay their respects. At least five police vehicles arrived in the surrounding streets, including a dog van, and officers with guns were positioned at the front and back of the house before leaving about 30 minutes later. The force said it was cooperating with an IPPC investigation into the shooting. Two neighbours said Yaqub’s house had been shot at in a drive-by incident last year. A family friend said he had been targeted two or three years ago with shotgun pellets. “It’s a bit of a shock, really,” said Melanie Heyer, who said she had CCTV installed outside her front door after the incident. “Two men with shotguns came to his house to try to shoot him last year. It was after school and there was kids everywhere.” Another neighbour, who declined to be named for fear of reprisals, said there had been a “load of police” on the street after the alleged shooting last year. “It’s all drugs related,” he said. “It’s getting commoner and commoner unfortunately.” Yaqub, who was regularly seen with high-performance sports cars outside his family home, was acquitted seven years ago of attempted murder in the Huddersfield suburb of Birkby. Aged 21 at the time, he was accused of being one of the gunmen in a drive-by shooting in September 2009. The case against him at Bradford crown court was dropped in May 2010 due to a lack of evidence. Friends paid tribute to the father of two on social media on Tuesday. Saima Khan said: “So sad, my heart goes out to his parents.” Brigid Harbour said: “Very sad for his family.” Another friend wrote: “You were no angel but you were still one of the good guys and did not deserve this.” Sam King posted on Facebook: “May Allah grant him the highest rank in Jannat-Al Firdous, Ameen Mohammed Yassar Yaqub, 27, from Huddersfield was killed by the police yesterday, whatever the reason, this was wrong to do, and didn’t deserve, leaves behind his family and friends. Sad news.” Pictures from the scene of the shooting appeared to show a silver Audi that had been boxed in by a silver Mercedes E-class on the junction 24 slip road. The Audi appeared to have three distinct gunshot marks on the driver’s side of the windscreen. Gemma Wilson, a Conservative councillor who was in the area at the time, said five or six police cars appeared to be acting as a barricade on Ainley Top roundabout, off the M62. “I was coming back at 6.15pm from the cinema with the kids and you could hear the police cars’ sirens as you approached,” she said. “The police cars on the roundabout seemed to be being used as a barricade but I’m not sure … There seemed to be some other unmarked cars as well, parked up, but I’m not sure whether they were involved in the operation or not. It was an absolute hive of police activity.” People had initially believed the incident was a lorry or bus crash, Wilson said, but she added: “It didn’t look like a normal car crash. We just had a gut feeling that something was wrong. “An hour later I walked to the supermarket and the traffic was absolutely awful, you could see a sea of blue flashing lights. The traffic this morning is getting quite bad on the first working day after Christmas as well, so it’s going to hit the area quite badly.” Shahnaz Malik, 54, a foster carer whose house overlooks the scene, said she was “absolutely petrified, terrified” because the incident had taken place so close to her home. “It was like time stood still, everyone was just stood in shock. The police and the cars had come to an absolute stop,” she said. “Police were looking into the car and then the ambulance arrived in a matter of minutes. I didn’t hear the gunshots. It looks like there’s some things dragged out of the car, like a bag that’s been emptied.” She added: “It’s a little village and a very tightknit community, but we haven’t had a chance to speak about it yet.” Rahul Tandon, from Halifax, told BBC Radio Leeds he was stopped by police on the exit slip road of junction 24. “As we pulled off the motorway we could see a lot of police vehicles, a lot of flashing lights,” he said. “We were basically the first car that was stopped by police and we just waited and waited. “Over the next 10 to 15 minutes there was frenetic activity as more and more police vehicles arrived. At about 6.15pm to 6.20pm policemen were running up the slope to an ambulance and beckoning them to come quickly.” The incident was the fifth fatal police shooting in England and Wales in the past nine months and the first involving West Yorkshire police since December 2010. A spokesman for the force said on Monday night: “Around 6pm this evening during a pre-planned policing operation near to the M62 in Huddersfield, a police firearm was discharged and a man has died. “The slip roads east- and westbound at junction 24 of the M62 remain closed. An immediate referral has been made to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, who are in attendance in West Yorkshire, and West Yorkshire police are fully cooperating with their investigation.” Mark Burns-Williamson, the West Yorkshire police and crime commissioner, said he was being kept updated by the chief constable. “The Independent Police Complaints Commission have now launched an investigation following a mandatory referral to them and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this stage until more details are known,” he said.','https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/03/man-shot-dead-by-police-on-m62-during-planned-operation','M62 shooting: man killed by police during planned operation',416,'uk-news'),('world/2017/jan/03/why-inside-is-out-for-rural-indian-toilets','Dr Smita Yadav argues that “inside toilets may not suit Indian villagers” for a variety reasons (Letters, 29 December).

The referees list for the cup games was drawn up before Monday’s match at the London Stadium, when Dean dismissed Feghouli in the 15th minute. The West Ham player was desperately unlucky and his manager, Slaven Bilic, suggested that if anybody was to have been sent off following the flashpoint it should have been Jones. West Ham ended up losing 2-0 and have appealed against the red card. A Football Association commission is expected to rule on that on Wednesday. There are no plans to demote Dean for the cup tie at White Hart Lane, although he could, in theory, still face censure in the Premier League, as the panel has yet to assign referees for the next round of fixtures.

It sparked an outcry over racism in sport, with politicians and the then French and British prime ministers condemning the attack. Only two of the accused attended the criminal trial in Paris for aggravated racist violence. The other two were tried in their absence. The four were ordered to pay the victim €10,000 (£8,500) in total. The French state prosecutor said the trial was a defining moment in anti-racism cases and a “clear-cut example” of racism: it was rare to have such an unabashed violently racist incident that was brazenly accompanied by the chanting seen in the video footage. Souleymane Sylla, the 35-year-old Parisian salesman who had been trying to get home on the Métro when he was repeatedly pushed out of the carriage by Chelsea fans shouting racist chants, told the panel of three judges his life had been “shaken up” by the violence. He had had to stop work for different periods, did not use the Métro for nine months and had been on medication, he said. Outside court Sylla, a father of four, told the Guardian: “I am glad to see justice done.” He said he had not been afraid to face the convicted men in court. “I have been waiting for justice for two years.” Joshua Parsons, 22, from Dorking, Surrey, who lost his London finance job after the incident, described himself in court as a trainee scaffolder. He was convicted of racist violence and given an eight-month suspended prison sentence. Parsons admitted in court that he had repeatedly pushed Sylla out of the carriage but said it was not a racist act and that he had not chanted racist songs. Speaking via an interpreter, Parsons said he had arrived in Paris the night before the match, slept in a hotel near the Gare du Nord and spent from midday to 6pm in a bar where he had five alcoholic drinks. He was on the way to the Chelsea-PSG match when the incident took place. Parsons told the court the Métro was packed and the atmosphere was “hot and hostile”. He said Sylla was “bigger than me” and when the commuter tried to get on the carriage “I pushed back”. He said the pushing was not related to the colour of Sylla’s skin. “The only time I knew the skin colour was when I saw the video afterwards,” he said. Questioned by the state prosecutor, Parsons said that after he pushed Sylla the first time, he chanted “Chelsea, Chelsea, Chelsea,” and after he pushed him a second time, he chanted “Fuck the IRA”. He said the chant “We’re racist, we’re racist and that’s the way we like it” was shouted in another carriage; he did not sing it and he “did not like that chant”. Parsons said: “I’m very sorry for Mr Sylla but I wasn’t racist in any way.” Parsons’ lawyer said his life had been affected by the “total hysteria” of the media, members of which had arrived at his home after he was identified as one of the fans in the video. Parsons, who once posed for a photograph with Nigel Farage, said journalists had come on to “my land” and rung his grandmother’s doorbell every half an hour. He said he had lost his finance job in Mayfair, London, and had briefly moved to Cornwall where he retrained as a scaffolder. His lawyer said Parsons’ entourage described him as a “well-brought-up boy” and two former dormitory friends from his boarding school, who were not white, had testified that he was not racist. James Fairbairn, 25, a civil engineer from Kent, who also appeared in the Paris court, was convicted of racist violence and given a six-month suspended sentence. He was accused in court of having made a hand gesture towards Sylla, in which he pointed his finger towards his face and neck to indicate that Sylla’s skin colour was the reason he was being pushed off the train. He was not accused of pushing Sylla. Fairbairn denied making a hand gesture towards Sylla and said: “I haven’t done anything racist in any way.” Two other men, William Simpson, 37, from Ashford, and Richard Barklie, a former police officer in the Northern Ireland RUC, were not present in court. They were each given 12-month suspended prison sentences. Both had answered a questionnaire for the French investigation in which they had denied racist violence. The pleas in court by Parsons and Fairbairn that they had not been guilty of a racist act were brushed aside by the prosecutor, Julie Duwez, who said the trial had become a major political and media event. She thanked the British police for their close cooperation with the investigation. Sylla’s lawyer, Jim Michel-Gabriel, told the court the crime was the definition of “hatred and unashamed racism”. The court was shown the video that ran on the Guardian website soon after the incident in February 2015, as well as longer CCTV video footage from the Métro system that showed the incident. Duwez told the court that the violence was such that Sylla’s “feared he would die”. After the incident, all of the men except Fairbairn were banned from Chelsea and England football matches for the maximum of five years by a UK magistrates court. Fairbairn was given a three-year banning order. Chelsea declined to comment but are understood to be satisfied with the verdict. When the men were handed football banning orders in July last year, Chelsea separately banned them for life from Stamford Bridge and from buying tickets, saying their behaviour was “abhorrent, against all of the club’s values and falls way below the standards the club expects of supporters attending our games”. It said at the time: “The club will continue to take action against supporters we feel behave in an antisocial manner and will cooperate with the relevant police authorities in any future investigations. Chelsea FC is proud of its diversity, which runs throughout the club – from our owner to our multicultural playing squad and backroom team, the staff and our fans.”','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/03/chelsea-football-fans-convicted-of-racist-violence-in-paris','Chelsea football fans convicted of racist violence in Paris',421,'world'),('business/2017/jan/03/richard-cousins-resigns-tesco-board-directors-compass-group','Richard Cousins, the chief executive of the catering group Compass, has abruptly left his position as senior independent director of Tesco just days before Britain’s biggest retailer unveils its Christmas trading figures.

But sources close to the supermarket chain said the most probable reason for him quitting was a clash with the rest of the board, particularly the Tesco chief executive, Dave Lewis. John Allan, chairman of the retailer, said: “On behalf of the board, I would like to thank Richard for his strong contributions to the deliberations of the Tesco board over the last two years and particularly for his insights and invaluable advice as we have delivered an unprecedented level of change across the business. We wish him well for the future.” Deanna Oppenheimer will replace Cousins as the senior independent director. Oppenheimer, who led Barclays high street banking operations in Europe, has been on the board of Tesco for almost five years. Shares in Tesco fell 1.35, or 0.65%, to 205.5p on Tuesday. The share price remains below the 230p level that it was at when Lewis took over in September 2014, although since then he has uncovered a £326m gap in the company’s finances owing to the accounting scandal. Tesco also posted an annual pre-tax loss of £6.4bn, one of the biggest in British corporate history. The company is scheduled to a publish a trading statement on the vital festive season – the busiest period of the year for food retailers – on 12 January. Cousins has led Compass for almost 11 years, but this is not the first time he has left a non-executive position unexpectedly. In December 2013, the health, hygiene and home products group Reckitt Benckiser announced Cousins would step down as a non-executive director because he was “assuming an increasingly day-to-day operational role as chief executive of Compass” and this would “impact on his ability to devote sufficient time to his role as a non-executive director of RB”.','https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/03/richard-cousins-resigns-tesco-board-directors-compass-group','Richard Cousins makes shock departure from Tesco board of directors',422,'business'),('sport/blog/2017/jan/03/bradford-bulls-rugby-league-liquidation-rfl-championship','It was perhaps the opening few words of the Rugby Football League’s statement regarding the liquidation of Bradford Bulls which struck the most telling chord of all. “While this is terribly disappointing and sad,” they said, “it is not an entirely surprising development given the scale of debt incurred by the previous management of the club and the debilitating level of financial commitment already entered into for 2017.” However, this was not the result of a few months of off-field troubles for the former Super League champions, more the culmination of years of mismanagement for a club who blazed a trail for so many following rugby league’s switch to summer in 1996. At the height of what was dubbed Bullmania, it was not uncommon to see 20,000 people inside Odsal. When the Bulls played what proved to be their final game in October, there were only 3,518 present. It was a telling indictment of how far the club had fallen. Those who have played a part in dragging a club who were world champions only 11 years ago to its knees should be ashamed. Three administrations in four years, relegation from Super League in 2014 and a failure to subsequently gain promotion have all combined to lead the club to their lowest point – but what now? The RFL has already confirmed that a new club should be formed within the coming days and will take the old entity’s place in the Championship this season, albeit with a 12-point deduction and severely reduced central funding. On a dark day for rugby league and the city of Bradford, that is at least a rare glimmer of light in all of this. Encouragingly, the RFL has already fielded several expressions of interest about starting a new club – and with that, there is hope. Any new company will start debt-free – rather than facing the £1.2m-plus the previous company owed to creditors – and it also has an opportunity to cut its cloth accordingly. In many ways, it is a blank canvas and the RFL will ensure only those with the club’s best interests at heart are afforded this opportunity which has now presented itself. Placing the new club straight back in the Championship as opposed to the bottom tier, League&nbsp;1, is a decision which will naturally be seen as controversial by some. But replanning fixture lists – which for League&nbsp;1 clubs include the newly introduced transatlantic trips to Toronto – was unfeasible, say RFL sources. Thousands of Bradford fans had bought season tickets on the assumption they would get Championship rugby – how would they be refunded? These are all problems which led the RFL to its decision, rightly or wrongly. But as encouraging as a new start for rugby league in Bradford could be, it is a process which will be intertwined with difficulties in its infancy. How, for starters, do the prospective new owners begin to build a squad capable of competing and overhauling a 12-point deduction this season? All the players are now free agents and many will sign elsewhere. Some, it is believed, already have and clubs already spending the salary cap will be given special dispensation to bring in former Bradford players. This is not a plan which can be carefully executed over a period of several months: Bradford are due to start the new season at Hull Kingston Rovers in four weeks. Will their coach, Rohan Smith (who should emerge through this process which a huge amount of credit for the way he has handled it), decide he wants to stay? That should be any new owners’ priority: keeping the highly regarded Australian would be a significant building block from which to start. However, that only addresses the problems on the field – which have to be solved with around £100,000 less central funding than the club were expecting for 2017. The RFL will offer the new club a chance to stay at their Odsal home on the same terms as the previous club, but there are myriad issues for new owners to solve to have a fully functioning professional club up and running in just a few weeks, as well as the business-related practicalities of starting a new company from scratch. For the good of the sport, this will hopefully not be the end of rugby league in Bradford, more the closing of a catastrophic chapter. History has taught us that clubs can reform and rebuild; Bradford did it themselves in 1964 after all. This, perhaps, is an opportunity for change and for a forward-thinking owner to start afresh but it will not be an easy road for whoever decides they want the sizeable task of trying to restore one of rugby league’s biggest names.','https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2017/jan/03/bradford-bulls-rugby-league-liquidation-rfl-championship','Bradford Bulls’ fate was down to years of mismanagement of a trailblazing club | Aaron Bower',423,'sport'),('uk-news/2017/jan/03/british-pair-found-dead-in-cambodia-married-on-christmas-day-mother-robert-wells-imogen-goldie','A couple who were found dead in a guesthouse in southern Cambodia on Sunday had married on Christmas Day, the mother of one of the couple has said. The bodies of Robert Wells, 36, from Sunderland, and his wife, Imogen Goldie, 28, from Camberwell, south London, were found in the seaside resort of Sihanoukville on New Year’s Day. The couple are believed to have killed themselves on Goldie’s birthday, which was the day before. Wells’s mother, Collette, who lives in Newbiggin-by-the-Sea, Northumberland, said when she spoke to her son for the last time he told her about the wedding and how in love he was. “They were on holiday and he rang me on Boxing Day to tell me they were married on one of the Cambodian islands,” she said. “He told me he loved her so very much, she meant the world to him and he would do anything for her. Unfortunately that was the last I heard.” Goldie was a singer-songwriter. Wells had worked in a call centre in Longbenton, North Tyneside, and also in IT in Manchester and London. They met in 2014 and in October 2016 decided to go travelling until “the money ran out”, said his mother. Collette Wells said she did not receive official notification of her son’s death and was only able to confirm it by phoning the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. She said she was devastated as a result of his death and had received little information despite alleged details of the deaths being published in the media. It has been reported that an alleged suicide note was found in the guesthouse that referred to mental health struggles and to a feeling that they had both been let down by the NHS. Goldie’s mother, Diane, set up a crowdfunding page to enable her to go out to Cambodia to cremate her daughter. On it she wrote: “This cruel system failed both my daughter and her husband, Robert, leaving them to find solutions to their mental health issues by their own hands. Will you help me bring my baby back home please?” By Tuesday, she had already exceeded her target of £5,000. Laura Lola High wrote on the page: “I am thankful your daughter was in my life, I didn’t know her well, but we were very close for a short period of time, she made some of my darker days much brighter. Xxx” Wells’s mother has also set up a crowdfunding page to raise money to go to Cambodia. She wrote: “My only son travelled to Cambodia and married his true love on an island on Christmas Day. They were both found dead of an apparent double suicide on New Year’s Day. I am desperate to get out there to cremate him and bring his ashes home.” She exceeded her target of £3,000 by Tuesday. Wells said she was devastated to have not even seen a photograph of her son’s wedding, although the couple shared an image of their intertwined hands with matching tattoos on their ring fingers. Friends of the couple left tributes on social media. Siouxsie Wild wrote on Facebook: “Just hearing about Robert Wells and Imogen. Such tragic news RIP. I hope you find peace together.” A Foreign Office spokesman said: “We are in contact with local authorities following the deaths of two British nationals in Cambodia and are ready to support their families at this extremely difficult time.” In the UK and Ireland the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.

The club are resigned to losing Sadio Mané to Senegal’s involvement in the tournament this month, but understood the situation with Matip was different. He has not played for Cameroon in more than a year after a disagreement with the national team, while still a Schalke player, and said as long ago as September that he did not wish to be considered for the Africa Cup of Nations. Liverpool actually thought Matip had retired from international football, but if so the Cameroon coach Hugo Broos did not appear to get the message and named him in his squad. The German‑born defender still has no intention of joining Cameroon in Gabon but Broos has indicated he may ask Fifa to invoke sanctions. If the ruling body suspects Liverpool of influencing the player’s decision or preventing him from joining up – something the club are adamant is far from the case – they could prevent him playing domestic games for the duration of the tournament. Matip has been on the sidelines over the festive period with an ankle injury but Liverpool expect him to be ready for a return soon. They would be surprised were Fifa to take action against the player, for they were under the impression that Cameroon had accepted the fact of his retirement some time ago. Speaking on the subject last month Jürgen Klopp said he was relaxed about the situation. “The players make these decisions by themselves, there is nothing the club can do,” the Liverpool manager said. The West Bromwich Albion right-back Allan Nyom also told Broos he wanted to stay at the Hawthorns to keep his place in Tony Pulis’s side.','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/03/joel-matip-liverpool-cameroon-africa-cup-of-nations-hugo-broos','Liverpool standing firm in Joël Matip Africa Cup of Nations row',425,'football'),('film/2017/jan/03/lindsay-lohan-mean-girls-2-stars-franchises','You have to feel for actors from time to time. (Well, you don’t have to at all, but it’s a new year and we’re still feeling benevolent.) There’s the finest of lines in a career between feeling overly defined by a successful role and feeling entirely undefined once that role’s cultural currency plummets – and once you’ve crossed it, it’s awfully difficult to pry your way back into the popular imagination. As much as we criticize certain big-name stars for clinging to the predictable comforts and rewards of franchise cinema, it’s hard to argue with its strategic benefits. Take Renée Zellweger: after a six-year absence from screens (longer for the vast majority that didn’t see her whimsical country-and-western disability drama My Own Love Song), what better way to jump-start a comeback than a third outing as the still beloved, still beleaguered everywoman Bridget Jones? A dozen years after The Edge of Reason, US audiences may have demurred, but elsewhere – not least in the UK – Zellweger and Bridget Jones’s Baby were embraced like old, long-absent friends. However the star’s other new projects turn out, she clearly still has a fallback role. At this stage, Zellweger is hardly the only participant with something to gain from prolonging Bridget’s diary, even if Hugh Grant thought it was time to call it a day. But what happens when an actor’s enthusiasm for reviving a career-high franchise isn’t quite matched by anyone else’s? Thus do we enter a perilous subdivision of vanity project, one in which sequels and reboots become less an act of fan service than a drive for self-preservation – one no less difficult than trying to make “fetch” happen. Which brings us, unhappily, to Lindsay Lohan. Once the brightest and most relatable of Hollywood’s mid-2000s teen pack, the actor presently known as “troubled” has earned fewer headlines of late for her work than for her broken promise to switch on Christmas lights in the small English town of Kettering – a variety of scandal generally unfamiliar to 30-year-old Hollywood starlets. Given her absence from cinema screens since Paul Schrader’s thoroughly greasy 2013 indie The Canyons, you can hardly blame Lohan for taking to the rearview mirror and casting her mind back to 2004, when the fast, fizzy, ultra-quotable Mean Girls set the bar for a generation’s high school comedies. Lohan’s performance as the misfit newbie in a shark pool of classroom cliquery remains her easiest, breeziest star turn; she clearly agrees, as she’s so desperate to play Cady Heron (at least) once more that she’s written her own script treatment for a sequel. “I have been trying so hard to do a Mean Girls 2,” she said in a CNN Facebook Live interview last week, conveniently (and not unreasonably) overlooking the existence of a 2011 television film with that very title. Trouble is, original Mean Girls screenwriter Tina Fey isn’t quite so eager. “I know Tina Fey and Lorne Michaels and all of Paramount are very busy. But I will keep forcing it and pushing it on them until we do it.” Those well acquainted with Lohan’s sometimes recklessly impassioned tweets should understand that this is no minor threat. Lohan’s one-woman campaign brings to mind misty memories of another actor’s attempts to reignite a dormant franchise with behind-the-camera input. As early as 2007, Sharon Stone was fuelling talk of Basic Instinct 3 – with a view not only to playing the bisexual icepick murderer Catherine Tramell again, but to directing the entire unrequested vehicle. We have yet to find to find out whether Stone was merely in stubborn denial of the fascinatingly all-encompassing failure of 2006’s abject Basic Instinct 2: Risk Addiction, or thought she could improve on director Michael Caton-Jones’s bungled handling – and let’s face it, she probably could. The rumor gets a fresh airing every few years, but Lohan would be wise to view it as a cautionary one. Yet it says much for the industry’s persistent gender imbalance that the attempts of past-peak actresses to reanimate career-making roles are so often treated as futile folly, while their male counterparts frequently get the green light for equally absurd proposals. Having written his own breakthrough part with Rocky 40 years ago, Sylvester Stallone thinks nothing of keeping fusty franchises going entirely on his own steam: Rocky V in 1990 was already pushing it, but writing and directing Rocky Balboa 16 years later and persuading MGM to back it was a feat of startling devotion to one’s own brand, if little else. Poetic justice came last year, when Stallone and Balboa were demoted to an admittedly Oscar-nominated supporting presence in Ryan Coogler’s Creed, an urgent, red-meat boxing drama that asserted itself as the best film in the Rocky, er, universe, without a scrap of writing or directing input from Sly himself. Meanwhile, even the franchise’s lowest points were higher than 2008’s Stallone-directed Rambo, a grim, desultory return to the jungle for the actor’s grizzled Vietnam vet, arriving a whopping 20 years after Rambo III and betraying every one of them. Vin Diesel, meanwhile, may yet prove to be Hollywood’s king of endlessly extended action gruel – not so much for the Fast and Furious series, for which demand remains globally clamorous even at the seven-film and 16-year mark, but for the considerably more against-the-odds achievement of bringing two far less actively invited properties back into play. Does anyone remember the xXx films – a less formally dressed James Bond reworking firmly rooted in the nu-metal era and aesthetic of the early 2000s – quite as fondly as Diesel does? We’ll find out this year, when Xander Cage pummels us back into submission in the prosaically titled xXx: Return of Xander Cage (no time or breath for definite articles here), while Diesel’s tirelessly slogging sci-fi antihero Riddick is also due to test audiences’ loyalties (or simply memories) with a fourth go-round. (Let’s not even dignify the mooted possibility of a Last Witch Hunter sequel with our consideration before we absolutely have to.) At this rate, Lindsay Lohan isn’t looking quite ambitious enough: she should strike with a proposed Parent Trap re-up while the iron’s cold.','https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/03/lindsay-lohan-mean-girls-2-stars-franchises','Lindsay Lohan\'s Mean Girls sequel: when stars take franchises into their own hands',426,'film'),('sport/2017/jan/03/horse-racing-tips-wednesday-4-january','Hereford 12.55 That’s Gonna Sting 1.25 Miss Night Owl 1.55 Nesterenko 2.25 Working Title 2.55 Keeper Hill 3.25 Strong Pursuit 3.55 Bobble Emerald Lingfield 1.10 Dreaming Of Paris 1.45 Par Three 2.15 Believe It 2.45 Alhajjaj 3.15 Snobbery 3.45 Skylark Lady Newcastle 1.35 Touch Of Paradise 2.05 Cajmere 2.35 Bollihope 3.05 Testa Rossa 3.35 Rock Warbler 4.05 Lotara Wolverhampton 4.15 Synodic (nap) 4.45 Kingthistle 5.15 Auberge Du&nbsp;Lac 5.45 With Pleasure 6.15 Sheer Intensity (nb) 6.45 Athassel 7.15 Oor Jock','https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/03/horse-racing-tips-wednesday-4-january','Horse racing tips: Wednesday 4 January',427,'sport'),('commentisfree/2017/jan/03/ive-left-twitter-unusable-anyone-but-trolls-robots-dictators-lindy-west','I deactivated my Twitter account today. It was more of a spontaneous impulse than a New Year resolution, although it does feel like a juice cleanse, a moulting, a polar-bear plunge, a clean slate (except the opposite – like throwing your slate into a volcano and running). One moment I was brains-deep in the usual way, half-heartedly arguing with strangers about whether or not it’s “OK” to suggest to Steve Martin that calling Carrie Fisher a “beautiful creature” who “turned out” to be “witty and bright as well” veered just a hair beyond Fisher’s stated boundaries regarding objectification (if you have opinions on this, don’t tweet me – oh, wait, you can’t); and the next moment the US president-elect was using the selfsame platform to taunt North Korea about the size and tumescence of its nuclear program. And I realised: eh, I’m done. I could be swimming right now. Or flossing. Or digging a big, pointless pit. Anything else. Twitter, for the past five years, has been a machine where I put in unpaid work and tension headaches come out. I write jokes there for free. I post political commentary for free. I answer questions for free. I teach feminism 101 for free. Off Twitter, these are all things by which I make my living – in fact, they comprise the totality of my income. But on Twitter, I do them pro bono and, in return, I am micromanaged in real time by strangers; neo-Nazis mine my personal life for vulnerabilities to exploit; and men enjoy unfettered, direct access to my brain so they can inform me, for the thousandth time, that they would gladly rape me if I weren’t so fat. I talk back and I am “feeding the trolls”. I say nothing and the harassment escalates. I report threats and I am a “censor”. I use mass-blocking tools to curb abuse and I am abused further for blocking “unfairly”. I have to conclude, after half a decade of troubleshooting, that it may simply be impossible to make this platform usable for anyone but trolls, robots and dictators. Surprisingly, none of that is the reason I left. I still loved Twitter – the speed of information, the breadth of analysis, the jokes, the gifs, the fortifying albeit intermittent solidarity, the chance to vet your instincts against those of people much smarter and better informed than you. Every day, people on Twitter – particularly people of colour, trans activists, disabled activists and sex workers – taught me how to be a better person and a better neighbour, a gift they persisted in dispensing even (always) at great personal cost. I still believe, at least in the rear-view mirror, in Twitter’s importance as a democratising force – facilitating direct, transparent access between the disempowered and the powerful, the marginalised and the ignorant. But I’m leaving anyway, for a while. I hate to disappoint anyone, but the breaking point for me wasn’t the trolls themselves (if I have learned anything from the dark side of Twitter, it is how to feel nothing when a frog calls you a cunt) – it was the global repercussions of Twitter’s refusal to stop them. The white supremacist, anti-feminist, isolationist, transphobic “alt-right” movement has been beta-testing its propaganda and intimidation machine on marginalised Twitter communities for years now – how much hate speech will bystanders ignore? When will Twitter intervene and start protecting its users? – and discovered, to its leering delight, that the limit did not exist. No one cared. Twitter abuse was a grand-scale normalisation project, disseminating libel and disinformation, muddying long-held cultural givens such as “racism is bad” and “sexual assault is bad” and “lying is bad” and “authoritarianism is bad”, and ultimately greasing the wheels for Donald Trump’s ascendance to the US presidency. Twitter executives did nothing. On 29 December, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted: “What’s the most important thing you want to see Twitter improve or create in 2017?” One user responded: “Comprehensive plan for getting rid of the Nazis.” “We’ve been working on our policies and controls,” Dorsey replied. “What’s the next most critical thing?” Oh, what’s our second-highest priority after Nazis? I’d say No 2 is also Nazis. And No 3. In fact, you can just go ahead and slide “Nazis” into the top 100 spots. Get back to me when your website isn’t a roiling rat-king of Nazis. Nazis are bad, you see? Trump uses his Twitter account to set hate mobs on private citizens, attempt to silence journalists who write unfavourably about him, lie to the American people and bulldoze complex diplomatic relationships with other world powers. I quit Twitter because it feels unconscionable to be a part of it – to generate revenue for it, participate in its profoundly broken culture and lend my name to its legitimacy. Twitter is home to a wealth of fantastic anti-Trump organising, as well, but I’m personally weary of feeling hostage to a platform that has treated me and the people I care about so poorly. We can do good work elsewhere. I’m pretty sure “ushered in kleptocracy” would be a dealbreaker for any other company that wanted my business. If my gynaecologist regularly hosted neo-Nazi rallies in the exam room, I would find someone else to swab my cervix. If I found out my favourite coffee shop was even remotely complicit in the third world war, I would – bare minimum – switch coffee shops; I might give up coffee altogether. Apparently that sentiment is in the air because, as I was writing this column, I came across a post by my friend Lauren Hoffman, a writer for Vulture and Cosmopolitan: “I’ve made many real/good friends on Twitter but I guess if I met all my friends working at, like, the mall and the mall became a tacit endorsement of fascism I would keep the friends but stop going to the mall.” Keep the friends. Ditch the mall.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/03/ive-left-twitter-unusable-anyone-but-trolls-robots-dictators-lindy-west','I’ve left Twitter.

Each person devours, on average, 1,996 lbs – or nearly a ton – of food per year. The enormous effort to satisfy that big appetite creates significant environmental impacts, from fertilizers leaching into our water supplies and overfishing to massive die-offs of bees from pesticides and habitat loss. Our eating habits come with tremendous social costs, too. More than 70% of the adults in the US and about a third of children are overweight. The medical cost of treating people who are grossly overweight, or obese, reached $147bn within the past decade. Increasingly, businesses from farms to retailers are under pressure to reduce the environmental and social impact of growing produce and processed food. Here are five challenges we face in 2017 and beyond. How to persuade farmers Making a strong business case to farmers that changing their farming practices, such as moving away from conventional fertilizers and pesticides, is hard. That switch can be costly and time consuming, and cause them to tussle with government regulators or customers. And there are no guarantees that their investments will pay off. The struggle to convince more farmers to switch to organic farming is a prime example. Market research shows that consumers want to buy more yogurt, cereal and other food made with organic ingredients, a market that reached an estimated $13.4bn in the US last year from $12.8bn in 2014. But only about 1% of cropland nationwide has received the organic designation because farmers aren’t convinced that the three years required to show the results of changing their use of pesticides and other practices is worth the financial investment. “Your farm is your financial life, and when you decide you’re going to change the way you’re doing your business, you’re kind of putting it at risk,” Chris Garibaldi, a cherry farmer in California, said in a story about initiatives by General Mills and Kashi to encourage farmers to go organic. “The grocery stores don’t give a crap whether you’re in the transition to being organic. All they care about is are you certified or not.” Organic farming also typically produces 10% to 20% less yields than conventional methods, making it seem an unattractive option. John Reganold, a soil science professor at the Washington State University, argues that farmers will make more money even with smaller crops because their organic produce can command higher prices. He also points to several environmental and social benefits, from preserving the rich soil quality to keeping farm laborers healthy. Reganold believes organic farming should play an important role in feeding the world’s population that is expected to reach 10 billion by 2050: “In a time of increasing population growth, climate change and environmental degradation, we need agricultural systems that come with a more balanced portfolio of sustainability benefits.” The trouble with antibiotics Taking a dose of antibiotics and finding out that it has no power to make you feel better is scary. That scare has become a big public health issue with the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, or superbugs. That has shined a spotlight on the use of antibiotics in raising chickens, cattle and other livestock because antibiotics are often used to prevent illnesses rather than treat them, and the drugs are also given to animals to make them grow faster. The widespread use of these antibiotics over the years has prompted the federal government to try to limit the use of antibiotics that are developed to treat humans. That has pressured meat producers and restaurants to sell meat raised with minimal or no antibiotics, including McDonald’s, In-n-Out and Chick-fil-A. And, after receiving an “F” by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) last September for the company’s lack of commitment on antibiotics, Burger King announced last week that it will start using chickens raised with a minimal use of antibiotics designed for humans. So far, this movement to cut antibiotics use is taking root mostly on chicken farms, as Sasha Stashwick and Lena Brook from NRDC point out in this opinion piece. But beef, pork and turkey producers will need to get their act together and follow suit. Illegal bounty from the sea Americans love seafood, consuming nearly 5bn lbs of it in 2015 and importing as much as 90% of the edible sea creatures they buy. Shrimp, canned tuna and salmon are the top choices. While this can create great economic opportunities, it also leads to poaching, slavery and other problems. The good news is consumers are demanding more sustainably caught and produced seafood than ever before, prompting big retailers such as Walmart, McDonald’s and Whole Foods to sell fish that’s been sustainably caught. These changes in preference have forced fishing fleets and seafood wholesalers to change how they catch fish, reduce bycatch and treat laborers fairly. In the tuna-rich waters off Palau, for example, the Nature Conservancy has dispatched scientists to show fishermen the benefit of using fishing hooks that can reduce catching unwanted or protected species. Palau, Soloman Islands and Asian countries also plan to experiment with using artificial intelligence to identify illegal catch. Coming up with alternatives to conventional fish food is another major industry wide effort to preserve a healthy fish population. Fish farming is a major source of seafood – the World Bank predicts that nearly two-thirds of the fish consumed by 2030 will be raised rather than wild caught. Fish farms usually use feed made with wild-caught fish. They will also see more options for feed that’s made with insects like black soldier flies. Fake meat diet It’s no secret that producing meat leaves a high carbon footprint. While eating less meat is an obvious approach to minimize that impact, asking Americans to, say, give up burgers and chicken nuggets might be as difficult as getting President-elect Donald Trump to announce that climate change is real. The challenge of feeding the omnivores among us has prompted entrepreneurs who, armed with hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital, have created meat alternatives using plant-based building blocks or cultured animal cells and tissues. One of those startups, Impossible Foods, debuted its burger in restaurants in New York and California this year. The fanfare attracted not only meat lovers but also vegetarians such as Mary Catherine O’Connor, who has not eaten meat in 30 years. In her essay about trying the Impossible Burger, she talked about her mixed emotion at taking her first bite: “As I took my second and third bites, I started to wonder if eating this Impossible Burger would flip some long repressed caveman switch in my brain, making me crave meat again.” As she pointed out, to make a real dent in cutting our greenhouse gas emissions, we will need McDonald’s to give the meatless burger a shot.','https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jan/03/challenges-sustainable-food-2017-organic-farming','Will 2017 be the year we get serious about sustainable food?',429,'sustainable-business'),('fashion/2017/jan/03/optimism-chic-the-look-of-2107-what-to-wear','Most Januarys are broadly similar. The lunchtime wait in line at M&amp;S to exchange that dodgy Christmas gift cardigan, the treadmills jammed with runners trying to remember how to work the controls, the Dry January martyrs making a massive song and dance about every Diet Coke in the pub. But this particular January feels tangibly different. Seldom has a new year begun with a zeitgeist united in such bloody-minded optimism. The social media mood on New Year’s Day was a curious mix of blitz spirit (“We can do this!”) and VE Day demob-fever (“We did it!”). The afterburn of 2016 is being felt in our collective determination to bring a better year into being through sheer force of will. Last year had more than its fair share of obscure buzzwords – from Kondo to post-truth to hygge – but the first of this year is one that everyone can rally around. Optimism is so hot right now. This is big picture stuff, but style is part of it, because on an individual level even big picture stuff gets expressed in small ways. Profound statements are posted on Instagram, and liked by your immediate family. And what you wear to face 2017 is a statement, too. In Susie Boyt’s book My Judy Garland Life, she writes that one of the lessons she learned from her heroine is that “Glamour is a moral stance.” Dressing to cheer and brighten the world in 2017 – whether by red lipstick or a Choose Life T-shirt – is a generous act. And so it is that the look of 2017 has a different slant to what went before. More cheerful, more colourful, more outward looking. With the benefit of hindsight, the athleisure trend that dominated the first half of 2016 seems to signify not simply the wholesome, healthsome vibe it represented at the time, but something about self-obsession and a brazenness about celebrating the shallows of humanity, which played out on a meta scale later in the year. The across-the-board embrace of optimism chic as we begin the new year is also fashion’s way of getting back on to the front foot. From Christopher Bailey backing the remain cause to Anna Wintour campaigning for Hillary Clinton, the industry was at its most overtly political in decades last year, and ended on the losing side. But instead of retreating into default black – being jaded and aloof, and taking refuge in style as classic tropes rather than engaging with fashion in the here and now – fashion has come out on the doorstep for 2017 in glorious technicolour. So: here’s what to wear, now that positive thinking is the new black. Accessorise with a cost-effective lunchbox of leftovers and that shiny new gym card. Rainbow stripes Don’t think we need spell out the symbolism here. The item that encapsulates the new optimism best of all is the Gucci rainbow sweater, which became a modern classic after it appeared on the Gucci runway, and shortly thereafter on Alexa Chung, in 2015. If you have the funds to buy this sweater, do it. Gap’s Happy Stripe is a cheap and cheerful alternative at a fraction of the price, now sold out online, although you could – optimistically! – try your luck on a sale rail. A La La Land dress The first iconic style image of 2017 is Emma Stone dancing with Ryan Gosling in a yellow dress, in the poster for Oscar-buzz movie La La Land. Mary Zophres, the film’s costume designer, has said that she wanted the brightly coloured dresses of the film to “evoke some kind of emotion that lands in the subconscious or conscious”. The dress is not a high-fashion yellow, but the yellow of canaries and squeezy mustard and those light-up hexagons on Blockbusters, and this is exactly what makes it jolly. Eighties nostalgia The second series of Stranger Things won’t arrive till later this year, but the look will be everywhere long before that. The fashion obsession with the show that saw the cast hanging out at Louis Vuitton HQ at Paris fashion week has fuelled a fuzzy nostalgia for 1980s dressing as remembered through Spielberg-tinted glasses. Think: varsity jackets over check shirts, backpacks with baseball caps and oversized denim jackets over floral dresses, as seen at the Topshop Unique show. Kitten heels The February issue of British Vogue, out this week, praises the return of the kitten heel. After almost a decade in the long grass, the mini-heel is back as a serious fashion option this year. The most prized options will be those with the Dior-branded ribbon slingbacks, or Manolo Blahnik’s collaboration with Vetements in jewel-coloured satin, but the options will be endless. The surprisingly impressive boost a kitten heel gives to your silhouette, combined with walkability, will put a spring in your step. And the name is perfect for a new year of cheer: goodbye killer heels, hello kitten heels. The hot shoulder The ubiquity of the off-the-shoulder trend in 2016 belied the fact that those clothes were more challenging to wear than they looked. A top that relies on your upper arms being pinned to your sides makes it tricky to drive, or cook, or dance. This year, the lady-shoulder will be a focal point once more, but this time padded, pointed, ruffled or possibly all three. Shown at its finest on the Balenciaga catwalk, this is a look that is about women taking up more room, rather than being encouraged to take up as little as possible. In a Trump world, a woman in a power shoulder takes on a newly subversive quality. Sunflower prints The splashy sunflowers on the Dolce &amp; Gabbana SS17 catwalk are set to make these the most fashionable of flowers. Having been overlooked in favour of more elegant blooms in recent years, the flower that turns en masse to face the sun channels the chipper positivity of the season. The colour ‘kale’ What’s in a name? Everything. What was once “army green” has been rebranded for a harmonious, vegan-friendly year with the name of Beyoncé and Gwyneth’s favourite superfood. With Pantone pushing green as the shade of the season for its associations of rebirth and renewal, the case for a new winter parka just got stronger.','https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/jan/03/optimism-chic-the-look-of-2107-what-to-wear','Optimism chic – the look of 2017',430,'fashion'),('books/2017/jan/03/use-john-berger-language-of-images-view-trump-polar-bears-kim-kardashian','John Berger, who died on Monday, wrote and said a lot of smart things, but he will be remembered longest for his 1972 BBC television series and book Ways of Seeing. The TV series belongs to the pixellated past, but the brilliantly designed book published alongside it by Penguin, with boldly montaged illustrations and stark, pithy text, is a bestselling modern classic. As Berger put it, we are visual animals who see before we learn to read and, even as adults, get our most basic orientation in the world with our eyes, which makes images extraordinarily powerful. Works of art are simply images among other images. It is a nostalgic lie to see them as lofty spiritual creations. A painting of a naked woman that was made by Titian 500 years ago is just as much about sex and power as a piece of modern pornography or a titillating poster. The advertising industry loves to claim the aura of “art” for its imagery. That is no surprise given that oil painting was essentially, for much of its history, a way to visually “own” women, commodities and land. In 1972, Berger wrote that we are free to see images in collages of our own making. Think of a pinboard where you stick your own favourite pictures, of all sorts, from magazine photographs to postcards of famous paintings. This is your own image world, in which you find your own meanings. It offers utopian possibility. Or, in Berger’s inspiring words: “For the first time ever, images of art have become ephemeral, ubiquitous, insubstantial, available, valueless, free. They surround us in the same way as a language surrounds us … If the new language of images were used differently, it would, through its use, confer a new kind of power. Within it we could begin to define our own experiences more precisely in areas where words are inadequate. (Seeing comes before words.)” Seeing comes before words – and after them. When you have lost the power to speak, when consciousness is fading, there will still be faces surrounding the bed. As in the death of a person, so in the decay of a society. The most uplifting thing about Ways of Seeing is Berger’s optimism about the age of the mass-circulating reproduced image, which, back in 1972, meant images in newspapers and magazines, on advertising hoardings and television. Now, of course, it also means on Facebook, Instagram and the internet at large. As for postcards of paintings, today we are more likely to snap a masterpiece in an art gallery on our phones. The democratisation of the image that Berger welcomed in the era when David Hockney was painting A Bigger Splash has got so much bigger and splashier. This has had some consequences Berger never guessed at. High art, which he saw as a snooty, aristocratic preserve policed by his arch-enemy Lord Kenneth Clark, is infinitely more accessible than he anticipated. Ways of Seeing quotes a range of statistics to show that only university-educated toffs went anywhere near art museums: those bleak 1970s figures now look very dated. One of the reasons art has become so popular is that artists have learned the lesson of Ways of Seeing. For my generation, the book was required college reading. It cannot be coincidence that artists such as Damien Hirst, Douglas Gordon and Jeremy Deller were to mix art and mass media in a “new language of images”. Today, audiences for every kind of art, old and new, are as vast as our appetite for images is boundless. Yet a utopia it ain’t. If the 21st-century language of images means art has never been so widely loved, it also means that vacuous, deceitful, falsely seductive, grossly manipulative images have never bombarded our semi-conscious minds so shamelessly. The democratic visual culture that Berger, or for that matter Andy Warhol, praised has given way to something much more manic, all-enveloping and violently irrational. It is hard to be optimistic about modern culture in the dawning age of Trump or to gleefully delight in the levelling power of the selfie. Or is it? What might Berger make of some of the images that define our age? Can he still offer new ways of seeing them? A statue of Saddam Hussein being toppled in Firdaus Square, Bagdhad, April 2003 Berger was strongly influenced by Marxist ideas of class struggle. In Ways of Seeing, for instance, he calls such art historians as Kenneth Clark “a privileged minority … striving to invent a history which can retrospectively justify the role of the ruling classes”. What might he see here? A statue of an authoritarian ruler is being pulled down in what looks like an image of liberation. It is a picture that evokes revolutionary hope and yet shows the toppling of Saddam Hussein’s image after the US led invasion of Iraq. Few see this as a hopeful image now. It marks the birth of a new age in which left and right often look bizarrely similar, when, for instance, the champions of Brexit can sound like French revolutionaries denouncing elitist “enemies of the people”. It might have stumped Berger, but not Karl Marx himself, who in his most subtle essay, The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon, writes that the new often wears the robes of the past. A conquest borrows the garb of liberation, a rightwing reaction dresses itself as a peasant’s revolt. Black Lives Matter demonstrators protesting at a police shooting in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, July 2016 This picture of a Black Lives Matter demonstration illuminates one of Berger’s key arguments in Ways of Seeing: that if you know your history, then you know where you are coming from. He didn’t put it quite like that – Bob Marley did – but in Berger’s more classically Marxist formulation: “A people or a class which is cut off from its own past is far less free to choose and to act as a people or class than one that has been able to situate itself in history.” In this image, the protesters use images of previous protest to locate themselves in history. Their Black Power salutes recall photographs from the 1960s. The face of Martin Luther King on a poster situates them even more self-consciously in the history of protest. These young radicals have a powerfully visual sense of history that vindicates Berger’s argument that images speak louder than words, as well as his belief that our understanding of the past frees us to act in the present. It’s worth noting that, on winning the Booker prize in 1972, Berger donated half of the cash to the Black Panthers. An explosion in a residential area as Russian aircraft bomb Aleppo, October 2016 This image of a savage bombardment of Aleppo by Russian aircraft on 4 October 2016 would surely have left Berger as speechless with rage and sadness as anyone. The contrast between the humbleness of the dwellings and the intensity of a blast that sends smoke and objects high into the empty blue air is monstrous. This image conveys the inhumanity of war with gut-wrenching eloquence. And if any insight of Berger’s matters, it is the simple human ability to learn the moral truth from images. We see, as he said, before we can speak, and for him, a war photograph or a painting by Van Gogh are both human documents whose truth exceeds words. To see the might of this bomb dropped on such a fragile-looking human community is to grasp the nature of cruelty. But Berger cannot help to explain what happens next, what to do with the insight this image gives. We have more images than compassion, more truths than solutions. If only we could see as clearly as Berger could. The smoke gets in our eyes. A polar bear on an iceberg, Svalbard, Norway, September 2016 Berger was suspicious of soft romantic images of landscape. He argued that Thomas Gainsborough’s iconic 18th-century painting Mr and Mrs Andrews, with its aristocratic couple seated in a rolling Suffolk scene of rain-pregnant clouds over bright green fields, is a celebration of ruling-class power: “They are not a couple in Nature as Rousseau imagined nature. They are landowners and their proprietary attitude to what surrounds them is visible in their stance and their expressions.” Perhaps this polar bear is a desperate successor to Mr and Mrs Andrews, its ownership of the Arctic ice evident in its stance and its expression. And yet the ice is melting around it, the world it once ruled is falling apart. Berger taught us to see the landowner’s whip behind every painted haystack, and his critical attitude to images of landscape is the more telling today when human action is destroying nature even as we lovingly photograph and film it. In fact, for all his mistrust of Gainsborough, Berger was a lover of nature and landscape who chose to live in the European countryside, chronicle rural lives and go in quest of cave art. So perhaps this bear is the last ice-age artist lamenting the coming of the plough. Kim Kardashian on the cover of Paper magazine, September 2014 “A woman must continually watch herself,” says Berger in Ways of Seeing. “She is almost continually accompanied by her own image of herself.” These words written in 1972 apply uncannily well to this image of Kim Kardashian. The queen of self-promotion has embraced what Berger saw as the oppressive demands of patriarchy. Does her self-portrayal and the hypersexualised selfie age confirm or mock his analysis of the nude? The early 70s saw a feminist intellectual revolution and Berger brought a feminist perspective on art into the mainstream. He argued that Renaissance paintings of the female nude by the likes of Tintoretto and Bronzino are just as much instruments of male power as are modern porn images. It has all got so messy since then. Perhaps every would-be Kardashian taking a saucy selfie is a self-oppressing victim of the patriarchy, but that’s a lot of false consciousness to go around. As with any severely moralising critique of modern life, you risk dismissing the people as idiots. I would argue that Berger also got Renaissance art wrong, as some of the paintings he condemns can be interpreted as sex guides that put all the stress on female sexuality (he sees Bronzino’s Venus and Cupid as an objectifying image and misses the fact that Cupid is pleasuring his mum). It all comes down to ways of seeing. Donald Trump holds two babies after a speech at the University of Colorado, July 2016 In Berger’s art criticism, it sometimes seems the worst crime in the world is to own property. He died as we enter an age when one man thinks the world is his property and that he can graduate from playing a reality-TV image of a businessman to “making deals” with all our futures. We see before we can speak, but the rise of Donald Trump (and Putin, and Brexit, and the European far right) suggests a much grimmer conclusion than anyone anticipated. In a world shaped, as ours is, by what Berger called “the language of images”, people don’t think too clearly. All those images that circulate so free and fast befuddle our brains. This image is grotesque and risible but, like a scene for Bertolt Brecht’s play The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, the grotesqueness is somehow part of the allure. Transgression is power. Berger was a moral man who wanted a better world. His art criticism, like that of John Ruskin in the Victorian age, is ultimately an eloquent argument for social justice and ethical behaviour. Oh, how far we are from the futures all the good men dreamt of. How madly the language of images hums.','https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/03/use-john-berger-language-of-images-view-trump-polar-bears-kim-kardashian','How to use John Berger’s ‘language of images’ on Trump, polar bears and Kim Kardashian',431,'books'),('football/2017/jan/03/watford-scott-hogan-offer-8m-west-ham','Watford have offered an initial £8m for Brentford’s Scott Hogan, with West Ham United also interested in the 24‑year‑old former non-league striker. Walter Mazzarri, the Watford manager, is keen to strengthen his forward line having seen his side score only 23 goals in 19 Premier League matches. He has identified Hogan as a solution, with the former Rochdale striker the Championship’s third highest goalscorer with 14 from 25 appearances. Brentford value him at more than £12m but with 18 months remaining on his contract they are expected to cash in this month. Watford’s offer contains up to £2m in add-ons and is likely to be matched by West Ham, who made an unofficial approach this week. Slaven Bilic is also keen to add to his firepower after the failure of the summer signings Simone Zaza and Jonathan Calleri to make an impact, while Diafra Sakho is injured. Newcastle had also expressed an interest in signing Hogan but it is understood the player is interested only in a move to the Premier League. Having begun his career at Rochdale, Hogan dropped out of the league in 2009 and joined the Northern Premier League Division One North side Woodley Sports.

Samantha Renke, who recently starred in high-profile adverts for Maltesers, has brittle bone disease, which means she is susceptible to injury and has to use a wheelchair. She was travelling from Preston to London on Virgin Trains on 27 December and was unable to take her seat because the disabled area she had reserved was filled with bags. The Lancashire-born actor, who lives in Shoreditch in east London, said she was travelling alone after visiting family and struggled to get on the train at Preston. When she went to take up the area she had reserved it was blocked with luggage. She told the Guardian she was then asked to move to the next carriage, where the disabled area was also filled with bags so she was asked to return to her original place. “There was no consensus at all between the staff what should be done, whether people should have to move their bags or not, it was me who had to step in and point to the sign that says there has to be disabled access in that area by law,” she said. The bags were eventually moved to enable Renke to take her place, but being surrounded by baggage there was “absolutely no way” of her getting to the toilet on the train, she said. “I couldn’t have a sip of water or a coffee. To be honest, it was so stressful I would have liked a glass of wine, but there was no way.” It comes after the Guardian revealed that the Paralympic athlete Anne Wafula Strike was left to urinate on herself because CrossCountry trains failed to provide an accessible toilet on a three-hour journey. Renke, who is a supporter of the disabled charity Scope, said the story came as no surprise. “It’s appalling, but to me it is all too familiar, it’s just our lives,” she said. “People don’t think about what those with impairments have to go through.” Renke said that, following the journey, she was left waiting on the train for 20 minutes for an accessible ramp to enable her to get off. “I ended up going to the door of the train and literally just shouting for someone to come, even the cleaners had left by that stage. It was a horrific experience from start to finish.” The journey had left her stressed and emotionally exhausted, partly due to the fact that the train was so overcrowded that she feared another passenger might fall on her and, because of her condition, cause serious harm. “It felt very hazardous. I was worried the entire time that someone might fall on me because the disabled area is just next to the toilet. Disabled people are expected to compromise, and not travel at crowded times, but I had to get back to work,” she said. She called for a fine to be imposed on people who make disabled areas inaccessible. “People aren’t scared to flout the Disability Act – there are no consequences,” she said. “We don’t have a lift? Oh well. There’s no toilet? So what?” She also called on train companies to be fined if they did not meet the requirements to meet facilities for disabled people. “Don’t put a disabled area and say disabled people have priority by law if there are no consequences if you do not. It’s just an empty promise,” she said. Renke contacted Virgin Trains via Twitter, writing: The company replied: “Not good to see Samantha. It’s worth making the train manager aware who can assist you further.” When Renke pointed out that “all staff were aware of it but seemed to be difference of opinion among them as to whether or not they should move luggage”, there was no further reply. “I was really upset,” she said. “It wasn’t even an apology.” The actor said she had faced online bullying since appearing in the Maltesers adverts, in which she tells friends about crushing a bride’s foot at a wedding, but boasts that she still managed to leave with the best man’s number. “Someone recently wrote: ‘Mutants like you shouldn’t be on TV,’” she said. “These are soul-destroying times for people with impairments. Benefits are being cut and when stories like this come out it feels very regressive, like we are going one step forward and five steps back.” The 11-times Paralympic champion Tanni Grey-Thompson said there was no consistent approach among train companies to disabled access. “Some companies only have two wheelchair spaces – one in first and one in standard. It’s variable where the toilets may be. Or if they work.” Lady Grey-Thompson said she commuted from the north-east of England to London by train about 40 weeks a year and there was not always an accessible toilet. “The reality as a wheelchair user is that you’re always having to plan ahead for toilets,” she said. “You’re always looking to see where an accessible one is; having to control what you drink.” At the very least passengers should be told if there was a working accessible toilet, for disabled and older people and children, said Grey-Thompson. But she feared train companies might try to insist that wheelchair users could only travel on trains with accessible toilets. “I could see some companies trying to do this. There has to be choice, but also some understanding from the companies,” she said. Bert Massie, the former chair of the Disability Rights Commission, which was replaced by the Equality and Human Rights Commission in 2007, said the women were brave to speak out about their experiences. “It takes courage to speak out in public about these things,” said Massie, who shared his own story about ScotAirways refusing to take him on an airplane in 2000. “But I am sure that for every person who goes public, there is an undisclosed number of people who are suffering indignity in private.” He added that things had got better, but there were still regular failings across train companies. “It is surely not an excessive request to make sure that when someone is on a long train journey, they are able to use the toilet,” he said. Phil Friend, a disability campaigner and chair of the board of trustees at the Research Institute for Consumer Affairs, which conducts research for older and disabled people, said it was difficult for people with disabilities to find out about toilet accessibility on specific trains. “The thing that is really disgraceful is that incidents like this mean that many people won’t travel, they just won’t go out,” he said. Like many people with disabilities the Guardian spoke to he had also been forced to get off a train to use a toilet, before waiting an hour for the next one. Wheelchair users point out that this often has knock-on consequences as the next train has no prior warning that a disabled person will be travelling, and there will be nothing in place to help them get on or off the train. “For Anne, a strong woman leading an active independent life, this must have had a devastating effect,” he said. “Back in the day when we travelled in the guard’s van maybe this was acceptable, but not any more.” A Virgin Trains spokesperson said: “We’re extremely disappointed to hear of Samantha’s experience. We want everyone to have an enjoyable experience on our trains and will look into this specific incident to understand exactly what happened.”','https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/03/i-feared-for-my-health-disabled-actor-tells-of-nightmare-train-journey','\'I feared for my health\': disabled actor tells of nightmare train journey',433,'society'),('business/2017/jan/03/sports-direct-chair-keith-hellawell-faces-renewed-pressure-to-resign','Sports Direct’s embattled chairman, Keith Hellawell, has come under renewed pressure to step down as a series of City investment groups said shareholders should oppose his re-election to the retailer’s board this week. The poll comes after the former chief constable lost a vote of independent shareholders in September. He faces a second ballot on Thursday to continue in his post. Paul Lee, the head of corporate governance at the Sports Direct shareholder Aberdeen Asset Management, said: “Though we welcome the positive progress the company has made over the last three months we remain deeply concerned about its governance. We are therefore again opposing the election of Mr Hellawell.” The second vote has been triggered under new rules whereby independent shareholders are ostensibly given an increased say in the running of companies in which there is a dominant shareholder. Sports Direct’s founder, Mike Ashley, owns 55% of the company, but was not allowed to vote on Hellawell’s role in the first ballot at the group’s annual meeting in September, when 53% of the votes cast by investors excluding Ashley opposed the chairman’s re-election. That result forced a second poll in which Ashley can vote. Dissenters may repeat their protest on Thursday, but company watchers believe Hellawell is likely to prevail because of the billionaire founder’s support. Apart from Aberdeen, investors including Legal &amp; General, Standard Life, Royal London and Hermes opposed Hellawell last time. Shareholder advisory bodies, which assist shareholders in deciding how to vote, also weighed into the debate. One of them, Pirc, told its clients: “It is important for the shareholders to be confident about the board’s ability to represent their best interests and not those of the controlling shareholder. This is no longer the case with the existing chairman and an oppose vote is therefore recommended.” Institutional Shareholder Services said Hellawell had overseen a “catalogue of governance and operational failures” and also advised shareholders to vote against his re-election. Rival Glass Lewis, which supported Hellawell last year but voted against Ashley’s reappointment, said: “While we acknowledge that many shareholders may choose not to support Hellawell’s re-election ... we are cognisant of the need for continuity in the leadership of the board, particularly in this period of flux.” The crisis at Sports Direct was triggered by a Guardian investigation in 2015, which revealed that workers at its giant Derbyshire warehouse were paid less than the national minimum wage. The scandal prompted a parliamentary inquiry last year, in which MPs likened the depot to a Victorian workhouse, reigniting long-held concerns about the level of control Ashley enjoys at the company. The newspaper reports also encouraged some investors to react after years of backing the board, including 76% of independent shareholders voting for Hellawell’s reappointment at the 2015 annual meeting. Aberdeen, which owns just 0.3% of the Sports Direct, said it viewed the company as having made progress by implementing an independent review into working practices and appointing the investment banker David Brayshaw as a new non-executive director. It also sees the departures of chief executive Dave Forsey and acting chief financial officer Matt Pearson as positive moves. Before the September vote, Hellawell attempted to appease disgruntled shareholders by saying he had offered to go, only for the board to refuse to accept his resignation. He said that if shareholders voted against him at the group’s 2017 annual general meeting, he would step down. Despite that offer seeming to acknowledge that he and the board accepted responsibility for the group’s situation, last month Hellawell criticised MPs, trade unions and the media for waging a campaign against the business as it reported a 57% drop in first-half profits. The results represented the latest disappointing financial statement after the company’s share price halved during 2016. The group was relegated from the FTSE 100 in March.','https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/03/sports-direct-chair-keith-hellawell-faces-renewed-pressure-to-resign','Sports Direct chair Keith Hellawell faces renewed pressure to resign',434,'business'),('us-news/2017/jan/03/donald-trump-inauguration-songs','So far, Donald Trump has just three performances lined up for his 20 January inauguration: Jackie Evancho, a former America’s Got Talent contestant; the Mormon Tabernacle Choir; and the dance troupe the Rockettes.

Shaan Taseer said the Sunni Tehreek, a grouping of clerics drawn from the Barelvi movement, was “gunning for my blood and provoking people to take my life” over a Christmas video he posted on social media in which he criticised Pakistan’s blasphemy laws. His father, Salmaan Taseer, the former governor of Punjab province, was killed amid similar controversy by one of his own police guards six years ago. The governor had infuriated hardliners with his demand for a government pardon for Asia Bibi, a poor Christian woman sentenced to death for blasphemy despite weak and contradictory evidence against her. His killer, Mumtaz Qadri, became a hero, and an estimated 100,000 mourners attended his funeral following his execution last year. The ire of the Barelvi sect, which on non-blasphemy issues is generally considered moderate, was rekindled last month after Taseer published a video expressing solidarity with people entangled in blasphemy allegations. He called for the release of both Bibi, who remains on death row, and Nabeel Masih, a Christian teenager arrested last year for “liking” on Facebook a picture of the Kaaba in Mecca, Islam’s holiest site. Taseer also demanded the repeal of what he called the “inhumane” blasphemy laws, a longstanding demand of international human rights groups who say the laws are widely abused by people who level false allegations to settle personal scores. The video prompted Sunni Tehreek to issue a fatwa, or religious edict, saying Taseer was liable for death because he had supposedly committed both blasphemy and apostasy. Police in the city of Lahore also lodged a first investigation report (FIR), a document that formally starts the process of investigating a crime, under the country’s blasphemy laws. According to the FIR, police claimed to have found the video on a USB drive left outside a police station. Mujahid Abdul Rasul, a Sunnit Tehreek cleric who demanded the police take action, said Taseer’s support for Bibi and Masih meant he “was equally involved in the crime” of blasphemy. “I don’t know why the Taseer family do this again and again,” he said. “His own father was killed for this so why is he also choosing the same path?” Taseer has not been named in the FIR, with officers at Islampura police station in Lahore claiming they had not been able to confirm if it was really him in the video. Whether or not the police pursue the matter, the mere accusation of blasphemy can be enough to incite vigilante attacks. Taseer, who lives abroad but visits Pakistan regularly, said the Sunni Tehreek was deliberately trying to provoke its supporters in the hope that someone would mimic the killing of his father, which took place in an Islamabad market on 4 January 2011. “On social media there are calls for another Mumtaz Qadri to deal with me and people are offering to be his successor,” he said. “What they plan to do is engineer another Qadri-like assassination.” Pakistan’s supreme court is due to rule on Bibi’s final appeal, which was postponed in October after one of the judges recused himself from the case.','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/03/pakistani-activist-shaan-taseer-fears-killed-like-father-blasphemy','Pakistani activist fears he will be killed like father after blasphemy fatwa',436,'world'),('science/2017/jan/03/lost-city-of-trellech-uk-archaeologist-stuart-wilson-defies-sceptics','The first clue was provided by moles. As the creatures burrowed beneath a farmer’s field close to the border between England and Wales, they threw up fragments of what appeared to be medieval pottery. Stuart Wilson, an archaeology graduate who was working in a toll bridge booth, took a gamble and bought the field for £32,000 when he could have been investing in his first house. Over the past 15 years he and a hardy band of volunteers have painstakingly unearthed what they believe are the remains of a sprawling medieval city. Wilson, 37, is preparing for an exciting 2017. When the weather improves he and his colleagues will continue their work on the site, focusing particularly on what he says is the skeleton of a moated manor house. He is applying for planning permission for an interpretation centre to tell visitors about the lost city of Trellech, and for a campsite for tourists and helpers. After facing years of scepticism from some within the archaeology community, he is now being listened to seriously. Before Christmas he was invited by Cardiff Archaeological Society to speak at Cardiff University. Wilson said his decision to buy the land had been vindicated. “People thought I was mad and really I should have bought a house rather than a field,” he said. “But it turned out to be the best decision of my life. I don’t regret it at all.” Back at the turn of the century, professional, well-equipped archeologists were trying to find the remains of the city but were focusing on the modern village of Trellech, on the Welsh side of the border between Tintern and Monmouth. In 2002 a farmer told the Monmouth Archaeological Society about the pottery that had been found in molehills on his land outside the village. “I went and took a look,” said Wilson. He investigated the site and within minutes had found what he believed was the remains of a wall. “That was a very good start,” he said. Two years later the 4.6-acre plot came up for sale and Wilson took a punt. “Much more experienced people were saying the city wasn’t there but I was young and confident,” he said. “If I was right the high street was right there in that field. It was a wonderful opportunity.” Wilson gave up his job so he could focus on the dig. Over the years he estimates that about 1,000 people have joined him, from archaeology students to intrigued people from the area. He said he had so far pinpointed eight buildings, adding: “We’re finding building after building after building.” A manor house, thought to have included two halls and a courtyard, may be the most spectacular but Wilson is fond of a well that was unearthed containing pieces of wood, bone and leather. Other features discovered include parts of jugs, cooking vessels, fireplaces and drains. One of the best finds last year was more ancient: a flint knapping kit thought to date back to neolithic times. “I’ve asked the person who found that to come again,” he said. “They are clearly lucky.” Wilson said the city was once home to about 10,000 people, perhaps a quarter of the size of London’s population at the time. He said the settlement was founded by a family called De Clare in the 13th century to manufacture weapons, armour and other military equipment. Agricultural workers were tempted into the city by the prospect of more lucrative employment. “If you’re working in the fields you are living hand to mouth every single day – it’s a really hard existence,” said Wilson. “Suddenly, a big industrial town comes here, this is a great opportunity for you. You up sticks and move to the industrial town where the opportunity is.” Most of the buildings, according to Wilson, seem to date from when the town was reorganised and built in stone after attacks by both English and Welsh forces. Evidence of the earlier town has been found below some of the buildings and occupation on the site may have started 100 years before that again, he believes. The city did not last long as a major centre. It was attacked by enemies of the De Clares and ravaged by disease. In later centuries fighters led by the Welsh leader Owain Glyndŵr targeted Trellech and it fell into ruin. Wilson’s project has not been cheap. He estimates that it may have cost as much as £200,000 over 15 years. It has been funded by individual donations, commercial activities such as “experience days”, and through an online shop selling historical documents. Wilson, who lives in a converted toilet block in Chepstow, believes that unearthing the city of Trellech will be his life’s work. “I think we’ve only found 0.1% of it,” he said. This year’s digging season will start in the spring and students and volunteers are invited to sign up to join in with key excavations in July and August. But what if Wilson’s gamble 15 years ago had come to nothing? “The field would have been a nice place to have a picnic.”','https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jan/03/lost-city-of-trellech-uk-archaeologist-stuart-wilson-defies-sceptics','Archaeologist defies sceptics in pursuit of lost city of Trellech',437,'science'),('us-news/2017/jan/03/house-republicans-drop-ethics-watchdog-trump','House Republicans were forced into a humiliating climbdown on Tuesday after Donald Trump tweeted criticism of their move to gut an independent congressional ethics watchdog. Members ditched their plan to severely weaken the independent Office of Congressional Ethics (OCE) at an emergency meeting just before the start of a new legislative session on Capitol Hill in Washington. The original rule change, carried out without warning and behind closed doors, had provoked a fierce backlash from Democrats and transparency activists when first announced on Monday night. But it was flexing of muscles by the president-elect that appeared to force Republicans to cave in. “With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it may be, their number one act and priority,” he tweeted on Tuesday morning. “Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance!” Trump added the hashtag #DTS, for his campaign slogan “drain the swamp”. His team confirmed it was the timing, not the reform itself, that had irked the president-elect. His incoming press secretary, Sean Spicer, told reporters: “He says their focus should be on tax reform and healthcare. It’s not a question of strengthening or weakening, it’s a question of priorities.” Even before Trump’s tweet, many House Republicans, including top leaders, opposed the measure and worried about its ramifications, the Associated Press reported. In addition, members of Congress were inundated with calls and complaints from the public, which may have played a part. At the subsequent emergency meeting, House majority leader Kevin McCarthy of California, who had opposed the timing of the decision, reportedly offered a motion to restore the current OCE rules which was accepted by members. The House will instead study changes to the office ahead of a deadline in August. Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a Republican, said: “People didn’t want this story on opening day.” Later McCarthy, walking through the Capitol building with an ice cream, was questioned about the climbdown. “I just thought when you look at the taskforce about the reforms that are needed, it’s better to do it bipartisan,” he said. “It was with unanimous consent.” He denied that Trump’s tweets had played a part, saying: “No, no, no. Last night these are things I told people. From a standpoint, it’s better if people see the process. I just think it’s better that full bipartisan work on it together.” Asked if the reversal had been embarrassing for the party, McCarthy told the Guardian: “No reversal on my part. Same position I had the night before.” But Representative Steve King of Iowa, who supported the measure and indeed would prefer to scrap the OCE altogether, insisted that Trump’s intervention had been crucial. “When President-elect Trump sent out his tweet, that gave license for the press and everybody else to pile on,” he said. The abrupt reversal was welcomed by Democrats – but with a note of scepticism. House minority leader Nancy Pelosi said: “House Republicans showed their true colours last night, and reversing their plans to destroy the Office of Congressional Ethics will not obscure their clear contempt for ethics in the people’s house. “Once again, the American people have seen the toxic dysfunction of a Republican House that will do anything to further their special interest agenda, thwart transparency and undermine the public trust.” Government accountability groups also expressed caution. Noah Bookbinder, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said: “The Office of Congressional Ethics is the only independent check on the House of Representatives. Without it we would return to a Congress awash in scandal. The U-turn marked a public relations disaster for the party on a day when it hoped to hit the ground running with an ambitious agenda that includes dismantling Barack Obama’s healthcare policy. Republican senator Mike Enzi introduced a resolution allowing for the repeal of Obamacare on Tuesday, his office said in a statement. The ethics office U-turn handed Trump a victory in what may prove a battle of wills over the next four years. It is not the first time that Trump, a billionaire businessman often described as an outsider who mounted a “hostile takeover” of the Republican party, has been at odds with its rank and file. His intervention came on the day that the 115th Congress convened, with Republicans in control of both chambers, hoping that the incoming president will prove willing to sign long-planned bills into law. But on the OCE issue, Trump did appear aligned with McCarthy and the House speaker, Paul Ryan, who had both urged their colleagues during the closed-door meeting to vote against the idea, arguing that it should be done later and on a bipartisan basis. Both men then appeared to defend the move on Tuesday morning – “The office is still expected to take in complaints of wrongdoing from the public. It will still investigate them thoroughly and independently,” Ryan said – only for it to collapse at the emergency meeting, fuelling a sense of confusion and chaos before Trump is even inaugurated. The OCE was conceived in 2008 to investigate allegations of misconduct after a series of bribery and corruption scandals that resulted in three members of Congress being sent to jail. The Republicans’ plan would have barred the OCE from considering anonymous tips about potential ethics violations, seen by critics as a potential deterrent to whistleblowers, and would have meant the OCE would have fallen under the control of the House Ethics Committee, which is run by lawmakers. It would have been known as the Office of Congressional Complaint Review, and the rule change would have required that “any matter that may involve a violation of criminal law must be referred to the Committee on Ethics for potential referral to law enforcement agencies after an affirmative vote by the members”, according to the office of Representative Bob Goodlatte, a Republican from Virginia who pushed for the change. Lawmakers would have had the final say on their colleagues under the change. Goodlatte expressed disappointment: “Gross misrepresentation by opponents of my amendment, and the media willing to go along with this agenda, resulted in a flurry of misconceptions and unfounded claims about the true purpose of this amendment,” he said in a statement. “To be perfectly clear, the OCE has a serious and important role in the House, and my amendment would have done nothing to impede their work or lessen the high ethical standards to which all members of Congress should be held.” During the nomination process for Ryan as speaker and Pelosi as minority leader in the House on Tuesday, many Democrats said they were voting for Pelosi because “the people’s house should be ethical, accountable and open to free debate”. One said: “We should read the bills before we pass the bills.” There were heckles from Republicans. Ryan won the election for speaker with 239 votes, while Pelosi notched 189. Republican Liz Cheney, daughter of former vice-president Dick Cheney, who won her father’s old House seat in Wyoming, sat beside her father in the crowded chamber, which included some members’ young children. Meanwhile, addressing the Senate for the first time as minority leader, Chuck Schumer, of New York, implored Trump not to abandon the promise of change that helped elect him. “Making America Great Again requires more than 140 characters per issue,” Schumer said of the president-elect’s habit of sparking outcry with a single tweet. “With all due respect, America cannot afford a Twitter presidency.” He added: “On January 20, we won’t be in reality TV – we’ll be in reality.” Vice-president Joe Biden, who also serves as the president of the Senate, presided over the swearing-in ceremony for a historic class of new senators. Among them were Catherine Cortez Masto, of Nevada, who is the first Latina senator, Kamala Harris, of California, the first Indian American senator, and Tammy Duckworth, of Illinois, an Iraq war veteran. The new Congress is among the most racially diverse in history, owing in large part to the minority party, which represents the majority of racial, gender and religious diversity. Republicans hold a 52-48 edge over Democrats in the Senate and 241-194 advantage in the House.','https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/03/house-republicans-drop-ethics-watchdog-trump','House Republicans drop rule change gutting ethics watchdog',438,'us-news'),('football/2017/jan/03/leicester-city-wilfred-ndidi-transfer-genk-nigeria','Leicester City have signed Wilfred Ndidi from Genk for £15m, subject to a work permit.

This “allowed” a few rich women to own and control their own property and assets. It was theirs in the first place, so that was nice, and we are all very grateful. As if that wasn’t enough, 109 years later, in 1991, marital rape became a crime in the UK, which was a very positive step in the right direction. We had already been completely spoiled in 1971 with the Equal Pay Act, which “allowed” equally qualified women to be paid the same as men for doing the same job. And, even though it is largely ignored, we’re all still hugely grateful for this incredibly generous gesture. There are still a couple of other minor issues that need more work (domestic violence, rape, FGM, forced/early marriage, etc etc). But the news that Tesco has reduced the price of women’s razors to bring them in line with men’s razors, which are a different colour, and presumably come with free Rawlplugs, will now be added to the “basic human rights women should have had anyway but have been made to feel grateful for” list. It shouldn’t cost a man less to shave his testicles than it does for a woman to shave her hands, especially if she’s on a zero-hours contract, and all hairy women who shop in Tesco are very grateful to Tesco for addressing this. Personally, though, I think this move creates as many problems as it solves. What if you don’t want to shave off all your hair for, say, ideological reasons, and now feel like you have to because it’s cheaper? What if you’re a hairy woman who doesn’t shop in Tesco? But shaving off our repulsive body hair isn’t the only thing for which women have been paying more for. On average, women pay 37% more for gender-marketed products, and given the gender pay gap, this is a real problem. But why just reduce the price of women’s razors, and nothing else? Why is Tesco encouraging women to have no hair? Did they find a pube in the women’s-toiletries aisle? Or are they just intimidated by real women shoppers? I don’t think this is a victory in the battle to eliminate gender-based discrimination in the high street at all, I think this is a victory for the patriarchy. Having loads of hair bursting out of my pants or swimming costume and gauging men’s reactions was my most effective twatometer, but I’m a sucker for a cheap disposable razor, so now I’ll have to think of something else.

In the US, France and many other parts of Europe, the right enters 2017 with newfound confidence while the left recoils in fear of the future, unsure how to get back on the front foot. Today’s report from the Fabian Society shows that Britain is far from immune from this, and highlights the scale of the task Labour faces across Britain if we are to win back public confidence and power. This is a time of huge change and huge challenges for progressive politics. But 2017 cannot be the year of lamenting our losses; it must be the year we turn the tide and set out a bold, ambitious vision that can rebuild and reunite Britain. A key part of that, of course, will be shaped by the Brexit negotiations. As I set out in a recent speech at Bloomberg, Labour will be at the heart of the fight for a better Brexit deal – one that puts jobs, the economy and living standards first, and argues for a more cooperative, collaborative future relationship with the EU: one that ensures Britain remains outward-looking and preserves our ability to trade in goods and services with a market of 500 million people. Above all, we will fight against a hard Brexit and the damage that would do to our economy and communities across the country. We will also oppose the divisive rhetoric of the right and seek to bring the country together around a Brexit deal that is in the national interest. The nature of the final Brexit deal really matters. It is, as I have said before, the battle of our times. Labour will provide effective opposition to hard Brexit in parliament and ensure there is the scrutiny, rigour and accountability that Theresa May is so keen to avoid. Ensuring we have the best possible Brexit deal will take time, effort and huge diplomatic skill. It also requires the prime minister to go against her form and be more open, accountable and willing to answer tough questions. So the resignation today of Ivan Rogers as the UK’s permanent representative to the EU – a highly respected figure in Brussels and Westminster – is a worrying sign. Rogers was right to emphasise the likely complexity of striking a final Brexit deal within two years, and the prime minister needs to be far more willing to hear difficult truths. Having recently met Rogers to discuss the Brexit process, I am in no doubt his early resignation will be a real loss. But while the immediate focus of the Brexit debate is on process and personalities, this cannot be the full story. If Labour is to reconnect with voters across the country and rise to the challenge of Brexit, we need to ensure that the process of exiting the EU is one part of a more comprehensive, ambitious response. We need also to comprehend and analyse the underlying social and economic causes of the referendum vote and offer a positive, progressive vision that addresses these. Among the issues our response to Brexit must tackle are: worsening economic exclusion and widening economic inequality; the absence of an effective industrial strategy to rebuild communities and provide higher-paid jobs; lack of public faith in the immigration system; a chronic skills gap that holds back too many people; and a profoundly worrying lack of public trust in a political system that concentrates power away from communities. In truth, these issues have been ignored for far too long. Even if the referendum result had been a narrow win for remain (ie 52%-48%), they would still need to be addressed. In light of the Brexit vote, Labour now has an urgent obligation to do so. We can of course be certain that Conservatives and the right of British politics have no answers to these profound challenges. Indeed, every indication is that Theresa May’s government will make these problems worse and leave Britain even more divided than it currently is. The good news for Labour is that the answers to these challenges lie in our values – solidarity, equality and social justice. Our profound and enduring commitment to human rights and internationalism will also underpin and shape Labour’s vision of Britain in the world. The bad news is that crafting these answers, and a bold project for the future, will not be easy. Indeed, this is a generational task. But, as with the best moments in our past – 1945, 1964 and 1997 – Labour should not be frozen in the face of huge challenges, but inspired to find bold, progressive solutions. That is the task the left and Labour in particular must turn to in 2017.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/03/labour-challenges-brexit-theresa-may-ivan-rogers-values','Labour can tackle the challenges of Brexit in a way Theresa May simply cannot | Keir Starmer',441,'commentisfree'),('music/2017/jan/02/kate-bush-article-1982-flexipop-hooligan','The co-founder of a cult music magazine of the early 80s has stood by the authenticity of an article first published 35 years ago, in which Kate Bush, now revered worldwide as a singer and songwriter, recalled her days as a bullied schoolgirl “with hooligan instincts”. The article, first published in Flexipop! in 1982, and now reproduced in a book of highlights of the magazine’s three-year lifespan, quotes Bush recalling the miseries of being a shy outsider at St Joseph’s Convent grammar school in Bexley, south-east London, bullied psychologically and occasionally physically. The article had been reproduced on some fan sites over the last 30 years, with caveats about its authenticity given that Bush, who returned to live performance in 2014, 35 years after her last tour, is famously protective of her private life. It quoted her saying: “I was too shy to be a hooligan but inside I had many hooligan instincts. I became very shy at school. There were people who picked on me and gave me a very hard time. It was a very cruel environment and I was a loner. “My friends used to play this game whereby they’d ‘send you to Coventry’. My friends sometimes used to ignore me completely and that would really upset me badly. I still tend to be vulnerable, but I’m much better at fighting back if people are nasty to me today. “I used to get the most terrible crushes on boys, always much older than me. And it was terrible. I used to think they were so beautiful. But I’d never get anywhere with them. Just the old fantasy trip of getting off on someone, was what it was about. “My life as a teenager was interesting and difficult. And it was important, because it stirred up all sorts of things in me. But I was very lonely. And even after I left school, there were times when the loneliness became desperate.” A spokesman for Bush said, when doubts about the authenticity of the piece resurfaced: “We have no further comment at this point.” Barry Cain, a music writer and publisher, was a co-founder in 1980 of Flexipop! which often extracted far more startling revelations than Bush’s from a string of pop stars. He insisted the piece was genuine, written in the first person but based on an interview. “All the artists featured in Testament Of Youth were interviewed at the time and the articles were all written in the first person. The piece in the book is a straight reproduction from the magazine and when it originally appeared there were no complaints whatsoever. In fact, we were even provided with a photo of Kate at her school. The Testament Of Youth series included highly personal interviews with the likes of Paul Weller, Simon Le Bon, Boy George, Kim Wilde, Siouxsie, Adam Ant etc.” Cain said he had been racking his brain to remember who carried out the interview: “It could have been any one of a number of people who were around in the office. But there were no problems at all with it, and we even got the photograph from her record company of the time, EMI. “The thing is people forget what they said 34 years ago – and then it comes back and bites them in the bum.” The only change he made in reproducing the article for the book was to correct Bush’s birthday, which they originally got wrong - “fact checking wasn’t our strong point,” he said. The book, complete with a new version of one of the magazine’s famous flexies, floppy plastic records that had to be weighed down with a coin to lie flat on the turntable, was first published 18 months ago, in a limited edition sold only through the website, which sold out. Reprinted a month ago, it is now selling across the world: Cain said he took orders on Tuesday from New Zealand and the United States. The Kate Bush piece appeared four years after her first No 1 chart hit, Wuthering Heights. Her homemade demo tape was turned down by numerous record labels before EMI signed her, and she released her first album, The Kick Inside, in 1978, at the age of 19. She went on to win Brit, Grammy and Ivor Novello awards for her writing and performing, and was awarded a CBE in the 2013 New Year honours list. Cain said he was surprised at the controversy over what he regarded as an innocuous piece compared with some of their other work. Flexipop! was banned by WH Smith for three issues after a photoshoot with a rockabilly band in the grime of the old King’s Cross railway land used animal carcasses from an abattoir. Cain said he had to give an assurance that there would be no more scenes of “gratuitous violence and cannibalism” to get it back on the shelves. This article was first launched on 2 January 2016. It was updated and relaunched on 3 January 2016.','https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/02/kate-bush-article-1982-flexipop-hooligan','Kate Bush had \'hooligan instincts\' in her youth, 1982 article reveals',442,'music'),('politics/blog/live/2017/jan/03/corbyn-labour-fabian-society-report-saying-labour-needs-pact-with-other-parties-to-win-election-politics-live','Sir Ivan Rogers has announced that he is resigning early from his post as Britain’s ambassador to the EU. He had been due to go in October, but he revealed today that he will stand down within the next few weeks. Some Brexiteers view him as an incorrigible Europhile who sabotaged David Cameron’s attempts to achieve a far-reaching EU renegotiation (see 2.08am) and the news of his departure has been warmly welcomed by those pushing for a “hard” Brexit. By contrast, pro-Europeans like Nick Clegg (see 2.18pm) and Lord Mandelson (see 2.49pm) have said that his premature exit is a blow for the government and that it suggests ministers are having problems accepting unpalatable expert advice. Rogers has not said why he is quitting early but no one is challenging reports saying that he clashed with ministers who wanted him to be more positive about Brexit. There is nothing particularly unusual about governments wanting the top civil service jobs to go to people who are at least not hostile to their political aims and it is conceivable that a more pro-Brexit replacement could help Theresa May’s government get what it wants (once it actually decides what it wants.) But May cannot take credit for forcing him out because his departure seems to have taken Number 10 by surprise. And it is also questionable whether there is anyone at all in the Foreign Office, or in the civil service generally, with the knowledge and experience to replace Rogers who would be pro-Brexit enough for the hardcore anti-Europeans putting pressure on May. Jeremy Corbyn has rejected a Fabian Society report saying Labour needs to think about forming partnerships with other anti-Tory parties because it has no chance of winning the next general election on its own. (See 9.14am.) Steve Hilton, David Cameron’s former head of strategy and a leave supporter during the EU referendum, has accused Theresa May of adopting a closed, “mean-spirited” approach to Brexit. Speaking on the Word at One, he said that he and others in the Vote Leave campaign called for an “open Brexit”. But the government has taken the opposite approach, he claimed, citing as an example the Conservative conference proposals (since abandoned) for firms to have to record the number of foreigners they employ. Hilton said: What I worry about is that the tone that Theresa May has set so far is exactly the opposite of that [“open Brexit”], exactly what we don’t need; a kind of closed Brexit, a mean-spirited, narrow version of what leaving the EU should have been all about ... What Theresa May is doing, certainly again in the tone that she and her ministers have struck, is to give the impression that the UK is pulling up the drawbridge, and instead of being open to the world, being closed to people. That is bad for our economy and our society. Major City employers are expected to decide within weeks whether they need to move business out of the UK as a result of the Brexit vote, the lobby group for Paris has predicted as it sets it sights on luring up to 20,000 roles away from London. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, has now called for a “complete clear-out” of the Foreign Office. Leave Means Leave has welcomed Sir Ivan Rogers’ resignation. This is from is co-chair, Richard Tice. Sir Ivan was a remainer who consistently failed to acknowledge the benefits Brexit will bring to Britain. His claims that a Brexit deal would take ten years to secure demonstrates the pessimistic and unrealistic outlook he had for British independence. It would have been completely inappropriate for him to stay in post and obstruct the Brexit process any further. His successor must be someone 100 per cent committed to embracing the opportunities a swift, clean Brexit will bring Britain and crucially, someone independently minded who will stand up for what is best for Britain in the upcoming negotiations. And here is my colleague Dan Roberts’ take on Sir Ivan Rogers’ resignation. He says it is the latest sign that the UK is heading for a hard Brexit. George Osborne, the former chancellor, has praised Sir Ivan Rogers. His tweet is not hostile to the government, but it is implicitly critical of those in his party and elsewhere who have questioned Rogers’ professionalism. Here’s Jonathan Isaby, editor of the pro-Brexit BrexitCentral website, on Sir Ivan Rogers’ resignation. Sir Ivan was due to leave his posting in Brussels later this year in any case; would those decrying his departure not have found it more disruptive for him to have to be replaced just a few months into the Brexit negotiations? Or are they simply upset at the prospect of a UK ambassador in Brussels who accepts the referendum result and can be relied on to support the prime minister in delivering a successful Brexit? Dame Margaret Beckett, the Labour former foreign secretary, said Sir Ivan Rogers’ resignation created a “crisis” for the Foreign Office. If, as it appears, [Rogers] is lost because he gave honest advice, that is not a good precedent. I think it is a crisis for the prime minister and for the Foreign Office. It is deeply alarming. My colleague Matthew d’Ancona has written his take on Sir Ivan Rogers’ resignation. Here is an excerpt. As a former home secretary, May is perfectly well-acquainted with the nuances and complexities of the EU. But she expected and required more from the UK’s permanent representative than to be reminded querulously of the obstacles to exit. As a prime minister who owes her job to a referendum that brought down her predecessor, she wanted the top diplomat in Brussels to offer solutions – and fast. That said, Sir Ivan has long been a favourite (and useful) whipping boy for senior Tories. It suited them to roll their eyes, accuse him of going native and blame the failure of this or that negotiation upon his lack of patriotic fervour. Now they won’t have Rogers to kick around. He will be replaced quickly enough, doubtless by someone billed by No 10 as a “safe pair of hands” – code for “more competent”. May will weather this particular squall. But a troubling question will linger and loom over the Brexit talks long after Sir Ivan has moved on: what if he was right? And here is his article in full. And here is some reaction to his resignation from British MEPs. From the leader of the Labour MEPs, Glenis Willmott From the Conservative MEP Charles Tannock From the deputy leader of Labour MEPs, Richard Corbett From the Green MEP Molly Scott Cato Here is some more reaction to Sir Ivan Rogers’ departure from commentators. From Politico Europe’s Ryan Heath From the Centre for European Reform’s Charles Grant Here is the government’s statement about Sir Ivan Rogers’ departure. Jean Quatremer, the Brussels correspondent of the French paper Libération and a fierce critic of British Eurosceptics, seems to be enjoying the news that Sir Ivan Rogers has resigned. Gerard Batten, Ukip’s Brexit spokesman, has welcomed Sir Ivan Rogers’ resignation. In a statement Batten says that the government should not replace him until the European Communities Act has been repealed. Then Theresa May should consider appointing Nigel Farage to the post, Batten says. When Farage was asked about this proposal, he told the Press Association: “That’s very sweet of [Batten]. It would be lots of fun, but it’s never going to happen.” Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, told the Press Association that “a lot more” British diplomats should follow Sir Ivan Rogers and resign. I think it would be appropriate if a lot more people in that position, British ambassadors, left. The world has changed. The political establishment in this country and the diplomatic service just doesn’t accept the vote. He also said Theresa May should replace Rogers with a “firm Brexiteer”. She should welcome it with open arms and put a firm Brexiteer in the position. Somebody who recognises that the world has changed, somebody tough, so we can get on with Brexit. Lord Mandelson, the former Labour business secretary and former European trade commissioner, has described Sir Ivan Rogers’ resignation as “a serious loss” to the country. In a statement issued by Open Britain, which is campaigning for what would be seen as a “soft” Brexit, he said: In terms of knowledge and experience of the EU, Sir Ivan Rogers is second to none in Whitehall. His resignation is a serious loss for us in Brussels. I would not expect him to comment further but everyone knows that civil servants are being increasingly inhibited in offering objective opinion and advice to ministers. Our negotiation as a whole will go nowhere if ministers are going to delude themselves about the immense difficulty and challenges Britain faces in implementing the referendum decision. Nicholas Macpherson, the former permanent secretary the Treasury, has got a Twitter account. And he is using it to criticise the “wilful and total destruction of EU expertise” in the civil service. Rogers spent much of his career working as a civil servant in the Treasury. His tweet refers to Jon Cunliffe, who was the UK’s ambassador to the EU before being replaced by Sir Ivan Rogers in 2013 and who is now deputy governor of the Bank of England; Michael Ellam, who dealt with EU policy at the Treasury before leaving for a job at HSBC in 2013; and Tom Scholar, who was the prime minister’s Europe adviser before becoming head of the Treasury last year. Here is my colleague Jessica Elgot’s take on Sir Ivan Rogers’ departure. Nick Clegg, the former Lib Dem leader and former deputy prime minister, worked alongside Sir Ivan Rogers when Rogers ran Leon Brittan’s office (or cabinet, in Euro-jargon) when Brittan was the European commissioner for trade and Clegg was Brittan’s speechwriter. He says Rogers’ resignation could turn out to be a “spectacular own goal” for Brexiteers. The resignation of somebody as experienced as Sir Ivan Rogers is a body blow to the government’s Brexit plans. I worked for Ivan Rogers in the EU twenty years ago - then he worked for me and the rest of the coalition government several years later. Throughout all that time Ivan was always punctiliously objective and rigorous in all he did and all the advice he provided. If the reports are true that he has been hounded out by hostile Brexiteers in government, it counts as a spectacular own goal. The government needs all the help it can get from good civil servants to deliver a workable Brexit. In his excellent book on the EU referendum campaign, All Out War, the Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman says some Tories blamed Sir Ivan Rogers for preventing David Cameron from demanding more from his EU renegotiation. Shipman argues that Cameron’s failure to negotiate far-reaching reform was one of the key factors that led to his losing the referendum. Here’s an extract from the book. ‘We were too beholden to Tom Scholar [Cameron’s EU adviser at the time] and Ivan Rogers,’ one Cameron adviser said. ‘They were status quo. They were happy to take “No” for an answer, happy to believe things weren’t possible when they could be possible. I’ve lost count of the number of times Ivan threatened to resign.’ The politicos say Rogers was aggressive in dismissing their arguments, and went over their heads to Cameron: ‘He would send emails that were the stuff of legend, saying why didn’t we know anything? We were just politicos, we didn’t understand.’ Another aide said Rogers’ emails were ‘notorious’. Rogers also clashed with the special advisers over their desire to include reforms to the European court of justice in the negotiation. [Daniel] Korski [a Cameron adviser] had a long-running battle with officials saying that we needed to do something, and he kept getting told that it was impossible to do something,” a Number 10 source said. Arron Banks, chairman of Leave.EU, has welcomed Sir Ivan Rogers’ surprise resignation. He said: This is a man who claimed it could take up to 10 years to agree a Brexit deal. He is far too much of a pessimist and yet another of the establishment’s pro-EU old guard. He has at least done the honourable thing in resigning. It’s time now for someone who is optimistic about the future that lies ahead for Brexit Britain. Enough talk, we need to get on with getting out. And here is some Twitter reaction to Sir Ivan Rogers’ premature departure from two pro-European experts. From Gregor Irwin, chief economist at Global Counsel, Peter Mandelson’s consultancy From Jonathan Lis, deputy director at the British Influence thinktank Here is some Twitter reaction to the surprise resignation of Sir Ivan Rogers. From the Conservative MP Nicholas Soames, a pro-European From Jack McConnell, the Labour peer and former Scottish first minister From Leave.EU From Labour MEP Paul Brannen From James McGrory, co-executive director of Open Britain, which is campaigning for the UK to stay in the single market From Michael Heaver, a former aide to Nigel Farage Here is a Politico Europe profile of Sir Ivan Rogers from three years ago. Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Commons Brexit committee, is on the World at One now. He says this is a time for continuity and experience. That means Sir Ivan Rogers’ departure is “not a good thing”, he says. He says Rogers needs to be replaced soon. Article 50 is supposed to be triggered by the end of March, and the negotiations will start soon after that, Benn says. He says the UK will need a new ambassador to the EU in place. Ambassadors have to tell ministers what the reality is, he says. I’ll post the quotes shortly. On the World at One George Parker, the Financial Times’ political editor, says the departure of Sir Ivan Rogers came as a surprise to Downing Street. Rogers felt the honest advice he gave to London was not being well received, and tensions were growing, Parker says. He says in Number 10 the view was that Rogers was too “eeyorish” and too pessimistic. Number 10 wanted someone more positive about Brexit, says Parker. Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform thinktank, thinks the departure of Sir Ivan Rogers will make it harder for the UK to get a good Brexit deal. The Foreign Office is now confirming Sir Ivan Rogers’ departure. This is from the BBC’s Rachel Kennedy. The Foreign Office has not yet formally confirmed the FT story, but government sources are saying it is correct. Sir Ivan Rogers, Britain’s ambassador to the EU, has resigned, the Financial Times is reporting. Britain’s ambassador to the EU has unexpectedly and abruptly resigned, just a few months before the UK is expected to start formal Brexit negotiations in which he would have played a crucial role. Sir Ivan Rogers told staff on Tuesday afternoon that he would be step down from his post early, leaving officials in shock over the loss of one of Britain’s most experienced EU negotiators. He did not explain the reasons for the move, according to people who have seen his note to diplomatic staff. Sir Ivan played down the decision, saying he was leaving a few months earlier than his original departure date of November. Rogers angered anti-Europeans last year when it emerged he had told ministers it could take 10 years to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU. The Daily Mail said at the time that the knives were out for Rogers and that there were “demands for Sir Ivan to be replaced with a diplomat who is more energetically pro-Brexit, amid speculation that his comments were deliberately leaked to undermine his position”. Devolution in Northern Ireland is facing fresh destablizing shocks in early 2017 with a scandal over a bungled green energy scheme threatening to undermine the authority of first minister Arlene Foster. Meanwhile questions have been raised about the future of deputy first minister Martin McGuinness with rumours of a major health scare afflicting Sinn Fein’s most senior representative in the Stormont assembly. Foster is under fire with serious questions about the so-called ‘cash for ash’ scandal which is estimated is going to cost the taxpayer £400m in lost revenue. The first minister survived a vote of no confidence in the Assembly just before Christmas. However, questions continue to be raised over what Foster knew about the scheme which has been described as a ‘fiasco’ and ‘the worst scandal since devolution was restored. With the DUP rallying around Foster and the party insisting there is no need for her to even temporarily stand down during the inquiry, other parties are now warning about a collapse of the assembly and a fresh election. Sinn Fein’s national chairman Declan Kearney raised the prospect of an election on Irish broadcaster RTE on Monday night warning that Foster staying in power would be “entirely untenable.” The Ulster Unionist leader on the opposition benches at Stormont Mike Nesbitt has put his party on an election footing too. However it is Sinn Fein’s position which will prove decisive given that the republican party is the DUP’s only partner in the regional government. The party refused to back a vote of no confidence in Foster back in December but has come under sustained pressure to distance itself from the DUP. Sinn Fein spokespersons have also had to field questions about Martin McGuinness’ health particularly after the deputy first minister was deemed too ill to travel on a recent Northern Ireland trade mission to China. There have been rumours - unsubstantiated thus far - that McGuinness could be replaced as deputy first minister by Sinn Fein assembly member and former Stormont Minister Conor Murphy. The multi-party opposition in the regional parliament scents blood but also risks plunging Northern Ireland into an election for which there is probably little public appetite. It is also a gamble for the opposition parties that the outcome of an election this month or next would produce any radical change in numbers on the green benches at Stormont after the votes are counted. Because the most likely result of a winter election would Sinn Fein and the DUP emerging once again as the two main dominant parties in the Assembly. Anas Sarwar MSP has put out a statement about the Fabian Society report on behalf of Scottish Labour. He flatly rejected the idea of some form of alliance with the SNP. Repeated talk of a ‘progressive alliance’ is laughable. The SNP is not a progressive party. There have been no redistributive polices from the SNP in government. Under the SNP we have seen the worst reports on our NHS and education system since devolution. Just last month the SNP and the Tories joined forces to defeat a Labour proposal for a progressive tax system. Under the SNP, Tory austerity is simply being passed on in Scotland, with the Nationalists planning a £327m cut to valued local services in 2017. That is not progressive - it is a budget a Tory chancellor would be proud of. There is also nothing progressive about seeking to break away from the rest of the UK - our biggest trading partner. That’s why there will be no support from Scottish Labour for a second independence referendum. And, of course, the SNP doesn’t want an alliance with Labour – it hates the Labour party and believes its destruction and the continuation of Tory government in Westminster is the route to independence. Here are the main points from the Number 10 lobby briefing. Downing Street defended the government policy of distributing some foreign aid in the form of cash payments. The Daily Mail has splashed on the story today, saying that over the last five years more than £1bn from the aid budget has been distributed in the form of cash payments. The prime minister’s spokeswoman defended this arrangement. She told reporters: It is important to be clear what these are. These are cash transfers that are effectively making sure that aid it targeted to those who need it when they need it. The effectiveness of such transfer schemes has been recognised by the public accounts committee and the National Audit Office who have spoken about the clear economic benefits of the system. She also said that “robust systems” were in place with cash payments to counter fraud. Number 10 refused to endorse the Change Britain claim that leaving the customs union could create 400,000 jobs. Change Britain, a pro-Brexit group, made the claim in a report issued overnight. Asked if the government agreed, the spokewoman said that this was an analysis produced by Change Britain and that she was not aware of any government analysis covering this specific issue. As my colleague Jessica Elgot reports, economists have disputed the Change Britain figures. The spokeswoman rejected Nigel Farage’s claim that Theresa May had done nothing to implement Brexit. (See 9.52am.) The spokeswoman said that May had set up two government departments to oversee the Brexit process and that Brexit department ministers had met more than 130 companies to discuss what they wanted. She also said that Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, had had “many fruitful discussions” with other countries about strengthening trade links after Brexit. The spokeswoman confirmed that May still intends to give a speech on Brexit “early in the new year”. But she would not say whether that meant this week or next week. The spokeswoman played down suggestions that May wanted to overhaul the honours system in the light of the controversy about some of the names on the new year’s honours list. Earlier this week it was reported that May was blaming David Cameron for the complaints about this year’s list and that she wanted a new approach to honours. But the spokeswoman said this year’s list included “a wide range of extraordinary people up and down the UK recognised for their achievements”. She said it was important to keep the system under review, but it was “kept under constant review”, she added. I’m back from the lobby briefing, but I’m afraid the Downing Street news machine isn’t exactly firing on all cylinders. In fact, it’s barely ticking over. It won’t take me long to write up the summary. Jeremy Corbyn and other Labour MPs have been out today campaigning against rail fare increases. Corbyn has also used Twitter to post a tribute to the writer and art critic John Berger who has died. I’m off to the Number 10 lobby briefing now. I will post again after 11.30am. In the light of what the Fabian Report is claiming about the need for Labour to former a “partnership” with other anti-Tory parties, this letter in yesterday’s Guardian, from Neal Lawson, chair of the leftwing group Compass, is worth flagging up. Compass is actively pushing the case for a “progressive alliance”. Perhaps John Healey also thinks he sounded a bit too despondent on the Today programme this morning. (See 9.46am.) The shadow housing minister has posted a corrective tweet with a slightly more upbeat message about Labour’s prospects. On Twitter the academic Matthew Goodwin is flagging up an article the psephologist John Curtice published just before Christmas showing how the electoral system now disadvantages Labour. It backs up point six in the Fabian analysis. (See 10.31am.) Here’s Curtice’s summary of his argument. Labour won fewer seats in 2015 than in 2010, even though its share of the vote increased. The decline in representation was occasioned by three features of the electoral geography of the 2015 contest—a collapse in Labour support in Scotland, a particularly strong Conservative advance in marginal seats and the fact that in England and Wales Labour’s vote rose most strongly in seats that the party already held. As a result, Labour’s vote became markedly less efficiently distributed than that of the Conservatives—a development that could make it very difficult for the party to win an overall majority at the next election. Meanwhile, the redrawing of constituency boundaries that is currently in train will make winning a majority even more difficult. However, the next election could well produce a hung parliament, and the party should be prepared for that eventuality. The Fabian Society report about Labour’s plight consists of seven claims, with analysis backing them up. Here they are, with extracts from the analysis. (The seven headlines are direct quotes, not paraphrasing by me.) 1 - Approaching half the people who voted Labour in 2015 no longer support the party Labour’s problems today start with its own former voters. 4 million people who voted for the party in 2015 (44 per cent) would not vote Labour today. Some of this group have switched their allegiance to other parties, but more than half say they are undecided or would not vote. 2 - Outside Scotland Labour is now no less popular than in 2010, but it is set to win far fewer seats Labour’s Scottish collapse has already happened (the party only has one seat left to lose), but in 2015 Labour gained MPs in England and Wales - winning 231 seats - so it now stands to lose lots of MPs south of the border. On the basis of current polling, Labour can expect to lose around 40 seats at the next election – all but one in England and Wales. 3 - Things could get even worse for Labour Both historic trends and current polling suggests that Labour could secure a smaller share of the vote than mid-term opinion polls suggest. A plausible, if pessimistic, scenario is that Labour could be reduced to 20 per cent of the vote at the next election. 4 - If Labour’s vote plummets the party will win fewer than 150 MPs at the next election, but the electoral system will create a ‘firebreak’ A disastrous election result for Labour would see the party lose around 90 MPs, but it would still be the second largest party by some margin with sufficient MPs to form the platform for future recovery. The Lib Dems or Ukip could only breakthrough if they won many more votes than Labour nationally. 5 - There is no easy answer to Labour’s Brexit dilemma Fabian Society estimates based on published YouGov data tables indicate that since the 2015 election, Labour has lost around 400,000 votes to the Lib Dems; and only around 200,000 each to the Conservatives and Ukip. It seems that Labour is equally vulnerable to losing support to another liberal-minded, pro-European party; and to the socially conservative, Euro-sceptic parties. 6 - An outright Labour victory is now virtually unthinkable, so partnerships will need to be considered Today Labour needs to win 94 seats to win a majority of one (compared to 68 before the last election). But this actually understates how much harder Labour’s task has become. Not only does the party need to win more seats, there are also fewer competitive marginal constituencies compared to previous electoral cycles (just 48 seats can be won with a 5 percentage point swing from the incumbent to Labour, compared to 74 in the last parliament). This is partly due to Conservative majorities being higher than before in England and Wales. But it is also because, in Scotland, the SNP are way ahead in most of the seats they hold (only 2 of those 48 marginal seats are in Scotland). This is a critical issue for Scottish Labour: not only does the party have only one MP, but it will need a huge turnaround in support to gain many more. 7 - The proposed boundary changes are a distraction, given Labour’s other problems The Labour Party has expended a huge amount of energy opposing the proposed boundary changes, and there is still a chance they will not be implemented because they are being resisted by Tory backbenchers too. However, compared to the party’s other electoral challenges, the proposed changes are a sideshow. Here is the Plaid Cymru MP Jonathan Edwards on the Fabian Society report. Scottish Labour has also rejected the idea of a pact with the SNP, PoliticsHome’s Kevin Schofield reports. In his interview with ITV’s Good Morning Britain Nigel Farage, the former Ukip leader, accused Theresa May of doing “nothing” to implement Brexit since the referendum last summer. He told the programme: I’m concerned that we have a government that is not really committed to carrying out the will of the people. [May’s] indecision is putting us on the back foot… What we need is some much clearer, firmer leadership. And we may well lose some fantastic opportunities: over 20 countries have approached us since the referendum to say ‘can we do a trade deal?’. At the moment we’ve started formal discussions with not one of them. This last allegation is unfair. Under EU rules, the UK cannot open formal trade talks with other countries while it remains an EU member. On the Today programme John Healey, the shadow housing minister, was also asked about what the Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said in a Daily Mirror interview about Labour’s poll ratings being “awful”. Healey said: Of course [McCluskey’s] right, they’re awful. The challenge now for me and the shadow cabinet and the whole of the party and Jeremy Corbyn as leader is to demonstrate that we can be a strong opposition and a convincing alternative to the Conservatives and that we can win over and win back public opinion, particularly those voters we’ve lost in recent years. Nick Robinson, who was interviewing Healey, pressed him on whether he thought the party might have to replace Corbyn at some point, but Healey deftly sidestepped this, saying the priority was winning the trust of voters. The Independent’s Rob Merrick says Healey sounded despondent. This morning the Daily Mirror has splashed on a story about a former aide to Nigel Farage facing up to 20 years in jail after admitting fraud. Farage, the former Ukip leader, was asked about the story on ITV’s Good Morning Britain this morning. He played down his links with Cottrell, telling the programme: [Cottrell’s] not an employee, he was a volunteer. He was unpaid. He was helping me do stuff. He’d been part of our party for a couple of years. We never had any suspicions about him at all. He faced 21 charges in America, 20 have been dropped. He’s pleaded guilty to a C grade felony. Listen, I can’t be responsible for what everyone around me does. Asked if he was disappointed in the former aide, Farage said: Surprised ... he was 20 years old at the time this happened. Guilt, no guilt, fallen into bad company - I’m not sure. Happy new year everyone. Although, if you’re a Labour supporter, the Fabian Society is doing its best to quash any new year cheer. It has published a report this morning with a title, “Stuck: How Labour is too weak to win, and too strong to die”, which sums up its entire argument perfectly. Here is the summary from the Fabian Society. Here is the full 12-page report (pdf). And here is the Guardian’s overnight splash story summarising its contents. The report is mostly devoted to analysing Labour’s problems, not proposing solutions, but it does suggest that the party needs to think about working “in partnership” with other parties. For the time being Labour has no realistic chance of winning an election outright. To win a majority of one the party will probably need to beat the Tories by more than in 2001; such was the scale of its Scottish meltdown. So a wounded Labour party will have to get used to the idea that it will need to work alongside others ... It is much more plausible to imagine a group of anti- Conservative parties securing sufficient votes to form a governing alliance than for Labour to govern alone – although even this would still require a very large reversal in Labour’s present fortunes. For example, Labour, the SNP and the Lib Dems would secure a shared majority if they gained 30 seats between them (but not from each other). This could be achieved if there was a swing away from the Conservatives of around 3 percentage points (to give Labour 24 gains and the Lib Dems 6 gains). This is consistent with Labour and the Conservatives being tied in share of the vote, which would also give Labour the moral authority to assert the right to govern. Another intermediate goal would be to win a majority in England or in England and Wales, which would enable Labour to legislate under the terms of ‘English Votes for English Laws’. Reaching this milestone would help ward off concerns about undue SNP influence, in the context of Labour requiring SNP support to maintain a UK majority. The two scenarios are: England and Wales majority – 56 gains (5.7 per cent swing, 5 point Labour GB lead) England majority – 61 gains (6.5 per cent swing, 6.5 point Labour GB lead All these possibilities may sound rather theoretical, considering how the gap between Labour and the Conservatives has widened sharply since the last election, not closed. But we are living through very fluid political times. By 2020 Labour and the Conservatives could each face very different political contexts. However Labour this morning is rejecting the idea of forming pacts with other parties. A spokesman for Jeremy Corbyn said: Rebuilding Labour support after its fragmentation at the 2015 election was always going to be a challenge. But Labour under Jeremy Corbyn will be taking its case to every part of Britain in the coming months with a radical policy platform, offering the only genuine alternative to a failed parliament political establishment and the fake anti-elitists of the hard right. And, when John Healey, the shadow housing minister was asked about the report on the Today programme this morning, he said: It’s a serious warning and, quite rightly, the Fabian Society say the roots of Labour’s problem predate Jeremy Corbyn, were there at the 2015 election and in some ways there at the 2010 election. These are big challenges for Labour. But I do not see the answer to Labour’s challenge as being to team up with the Liberal Democrats, the Greens and a ragbag of other parties. I will post more on this as the day goes on. The Commons is in recess, and there is not much in the diary today, but we are getting a Number 10 lobby briefing at 11am. As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

On the day my wife decides enough is enough, I can simply drag the tree out the front door, a few stubborn ornaments still buried in its branches, and launch it like a caber on to the pile. I think they compost them or something, but I won’t pretend I have any real interest in the rest of my tree’s journey. The first week of January brings on a kind of temporal jet lag. We’ve already seen in the new year, making rash promises to ourselves and investing the next 12 months with all manner of false hope, but the trappings of last year still surround us: an open bottle of wine that must be drunk or disposed of before one’s new relationship with alcohol can begin; unfinished books and box sets begun in the post-Christmas lull; old bills as yet unpaid. Two defining factors of 2017 – Donald Trump’s inauguration and the triggering of article 50 – are still a few weeks ahead of us. And that stupid Christmas tree is still up. Some of this is comforting. As previewed, 2017 promises to be a dystopian wasteland patrolled by driverless cars, so a brief transition period – neither one year nor the other – is certainly welcome. There is probably something therapeutic to be derived from pretending none of it’s happening yet. After all, If you’d known what 2016 was going to be like, you probably would have kept drinking right through January. Maybe you did anyway. If so, well played. Dog days On the other hand, there’s a lot to be said in favour of moving on, for good or ill. I recall that this time last year I was faced with a dog that needed putting down. We’d been preparing ourselves for the inevitable, but it’s not the sort of thing one wants to do over Christmas. It turns out it’s not the sort of thing one wants to do in January either – or ever. But by then it had become a bit urgent, so that’s how I spent my first business day of 2016: kneeling on the floor of the vet’s surgery, scratching an old dog’s ears for the last time. I’m not recommending it – I’m glad there’s nothing like that in my diary for the coming week – but if there’s a time of year for that sort of chore, this is certainly it. A week set aside for sad business, regrets and bleak reassessment. Either you can imagine that the rest of the year will be upbeat by comparison, or you can say that at least you’ve started as you mean to go on. Another pine mess I could not have known that this would be the morning my wife decided the Christmas tree had to go, or that she would not be dissuaded by my claims that I was busy. Her sense of urgency meant the annual “undecoration” of the tree was not the wistful, contemplative exercise it sometimes can be. As two separate strands of Christmas lights became hopelessly entwined during removal, I threatened an unpleasant expediency. “I’m going to cut them off with gardening shears,” I said. “Fine,” my wife said. “I’ll get the shears.” “Don’t be insane,” I said. In the end we pulled the whole tangled mess over the tree’s head, like a jumper, and I dragged it across the road. As I hoisted it on to the already substantial pile, I could not help but notice that the temporary fencing that normally defines the collection point’s parameters hadn’t been set up. Either I was a day early or the service has been discontinued, and I was simply participating in a massively popular form of fly-tipping. I suppose I’ll find out in the next day or two. But by then I’ll have already moved on.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/03/last-year-is-history-2017','Last year is history, 2017 hasn’t got going yet. Can I stay here please? | Tim Dowling',444,'commentisfree'),('uk-news/2017/jan/03/stephen-port-victims-landlord-i-felt-i-hit-a-brick-wall-with-the-police','John Pape’s surprise at finding four police officers on his doorstep turned to shock when they informed him the body of his former lodger had been found in a cemetery in Barking, east London. “It was like a horribly abstract thing, because the circumstances were a mystery,” said Pape, 38, a promo producer at a comedy channel. “My thoughts first ran to suicide or exposure.” Gabriel Kovari, 22, a Slovakian graduate who had moved out six days previously, “certainly didn’t seem a suicidal, self-destructive guy,” Pape recalled. Exposure? “It was August, and he still had keys to my flat.” Questions crowded his head. It would be more than a year before they were answered with the arrest of Stephen Port, who was subsequently convicted and jailed for life for the murders of four young men whom he had fatally drugged and raped and whose bodies he dumped near his Barking flat. In the year after Kovari’s death in 2014, Pape felt compelled to raise concerns over other deaths, but police failed to link them. It left him fearing for his safety and his sanity as he hit a brick wall time and again. “Looking back, knowing that your instincts were telling you something but your head is going: they’re the police, they’re probably doing a good job, you’re just obsessing – that is really infuriating. Because, I look back and I think: if only I had listened to my instincts more.” The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating 17 Metropolitan police officers over the handling of the Port case. The families of the other three victims – Anthony Walgate, 23, Daniel Whitworth, 21, and Jack Taylor, 25 – plan to sue the force. Pape was Kovari’s landlord for only six weeks, though he regards their relationship as a friendship – admittedly a short one, but one based on an empathy that often swiftly bonds gay men in a predominantly straight world. It may have been a tenuous link, but Pape was the last person police could trace to have been in contact with Kovari, who had arrived in London weeks earlier. Pape had offered Kovari the spare room in his south London flat for £50 a week after they met online in July 2014, at which time Kovari was staying in a hostel on the Isle of Dogs. A talented linguist who was learning Arabic, Kovari had just graduated from university in Košice, and was working in a shop in Richmond, Surrey, while hoping to get security clearance to get translation work for the NHS or police. Pape initially agreed he could stay for two weeks, but was relaxed about him staying longer as they were getting along. They went for drinks together at the local pub, and watched DVDs. Pape helped Kovari set up a bank account for his wages, which was what led police to his door. Pape knew Kovari was meeting up with men through online apps, but didn’t pry. Pape briefly saw one of them at his flat. Meanwhile, Kovari was looking for somewhere else to live, even though he was under no pressure to move out. Pape’s flat was small and chaotic due to building work being carried out. Nevertheless, Pape was surprised when Kovari told him he had found a flatshare in Barking and was moving the next day. That flat belonged to Port. “I regret not asking him more questions,” Pape said. “But I did say if it didn’t work out in Barking he could come back.” On 28 August 2014, five days after he had left Pape’s flat, Kovari’s body was found by a dog walker in the graveyard of St Margaret’s church, in the grounds of Barking Abbey. Like all of Port’s victims, his phone was missing and he had fatal levels of the date-rape drug GHB in his blood. While the IPCC investigation will consider whether police could have been blinded by a prejudice that risk-taking young gay men taking drugs could end up dead in cemeteries, Pape’s concerns about his friend’s death began almost immediately. He Googled “unexplained deaths in Barking” for further details about Kovari and found a local newspaper report about Walgate, a fashion student from Hull whose body had been found in strikingly similar circumstances two months earlier outside a block of flats in Cooke Street, Barking – Port’s flat. Google Maps showed him Cooke Street was just “a stone’s throw” from St Margaret’s churchyard. “I thought that was a strange coincidence,” he said. Through Facebook, Pape contacted Kovari’s Spanish boyfriend, Thierry Amodio, who was in touch with Kovari’s family and the police, to offer help. Over the weeks and months, he and Amodio exchanged hundreds of messages, sharing developments and their exasperation over the police investigation. Pape sent Amodio the link to the report of Walgate’s death, urging him to mention it to the police. “I wasn’t next of kin. The police wouldn’t tell me anything,” he said. “And I didn’t want to get in the way.” But he believes he mentioned the possibility of a link to the police officer who rang him on 6 September 2014 to take a statement for the coroner. It was a subject Pape would raise many times over the coming months. But the police remained adamant, he said. No link could be established. Another person who said he knew Kovari in London also became Facebook friends with Amodio. Jon Luck, apparently an American who had moved from Los Angeles to London to study humanities, told Amodio he had met Kovari through the dating app Grindr and they had had sex on or around 24 August. Upon hearing he was dead, Luck asked: “Will police want to speak to me as my DNA would be on him?” Three weeks after Kovari’s death, the body of Whitworth, a chef from Gravesend, was found in the same graveyard. He too had died from an overdose of GHB. In his hand was a suicide note blaming himself for Kovari’s death, saying he had accidentally overdosed him on GHB during sex. Much later the police would work out that the note had in fact been written and planted by Port. Luck’s messages took on a sinister tone. He began telling Amodio of friends having seen Kovari and Whitworth together at an orgy, and of chemsex parties in Barking where older gay men drugged and raped younger gay men. Amodio told Luck to call the police and provided a number, but Luck never did call detectives. Amodio told Barking and Dagenham police about Luck and his allegations, and reportedly provided a link to Luck’s Facebook page. If detectives had checked they would have discovered that the IP address associated with Luck’s Facebook account matched that of a social media account owned by Port, and that Port was already known to them in connection with the first death. Three months earlier Port had been arrested and charged with perverting the course of justice for lying in his police statement over how Walgate’s body had come to be found outside his flat. Later he would plead guilty to that charge and serve three months in prison. “Jon Luck” was Port, and the Facebook messages were part of his deceit to convince police of a link between his two latest victims and the theory that a remorseful Whitworth had killed himself. Pape had heard through Amodio the claims of chemsex orgies and the drugging and raping of young men. “At this point I just thought: what? Another dead body in the cemetery? Then there is all this about orgies and drugging and raping.” He knew that people Kovari had known had been to his flat. He was so concerned for his safety that he called Barking and Dagenham police. “I said: if this is murder, you have to tell me.” He said he was told it was not murder. Seeking reassurance again on another occasion, his call was not returned, he claimed. Pape remained concerned. Three bodies in Barking, all young gay men. The stories – which, of course, turned out to have been invented by Port – of orgies, drugging and raping. Meanwhile, he read that a senior detective had told the local paper the deaths of Kovari and Whitworth were “unusual and slightly confusing” and there was no link to Walgate’s death. “To me it all looked the definition of suspicious. But obviously not to the police,” said Pape. “I was thinking: what if this turns out to be the worst-case scenario, and I’ve sat on it and did bugger all? But I felt I had hit a brick wall with the police.” Pape felt he needed to exert more pressure. “I think it was because there was no one else in this country fighting his [Kovari’s] corner. His family is back home, he was only here for a few weeks. His death was a double whammy of a young gay man and an eastern European immigrant. So there was this sense: if I don’t, who will? “Then, where there seemed to be a link to the other deaths, it was not just doing right by Gabriel, it was about feeling I had a responsibility because other young men might be at risk. It goes beyond fighting his corner. It’s ‘do I need to be doing my best to raise awareness?’” He contacted the LGBT and human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell, who advised him to contact the Pink News website, and Galop, a gay and lesbian anti-violence charity. In an email to PinkNews in October 2014, Pape stressed that he needed to know the deaths were being thoroughly investigated, and his concerns that they were not. “My biggest fear is that vulnerable young gay men are being taken advantage of in Barking with fatal consequences,” he wrote, adding: “I do not trust the police to give this their full attention without someone pushing for answers”. He said he later learned that both organisations were told the first death was not linked to the other two. Pape was not the only one pushing. Walgate’s mother, Sarah Sak, also believed there could be a link. Speaking after Port’s trial, she said she had warned officers 12 times that Port could be the killer. As the last person known to have had contact with Kovari, Pape was called as a witness at his inquest in June 2015. The supposed Whitworth suicide note was read out. It contained the extraordinary sentence: ‘BTW, please do not blame the guy I was with last night, we only had sex then I left, he knows nothing of what I have done.” It added: “I dropped my phone on the way here so it should be in the grass somewhere. Sorry to everyone.” The inquest heard that police officers, not handwriting experts, had compared the writing on the note with that in Whitworth’s diary. It also heard that relatives too had positively identified the writing – a claim later angrily denied by the family. A bedsheet found with Whitworth’s body and covered in Port’s DNA was not forensically tested. Nor was a bottle containing GHB found at the scene. As an interested person, Pape was allowed to question the police witness, and his questions struck right to the heart of the case. Was there any established link – other than the suicide note – between Kovari and Whitworth? The answer was no. Could there be any link with the first body found? The answer was that no link was apparent. The coroner recorded open verdicts in the cases of Kovari and Whitworth. And that appeared to be that, said Pape. He felt there was nothing further he could do. Port was released from prison on an electronic tag in June 2015. On 20 September the body of Taylor, a forklift truck driver from Dagenham, was found in the same circumstances and the same graveyard. Pressure from Taylor’s family forced police to release CCTV footage taken at Barking station in the early hours. It shows Taylor walking with a man swiftly identified – by a police officer, in fact – as Port. Pape was on holiday in Nepal and just about to fly home when police emailed him with the news. “It was surreal, being alone in Kathmandu and hearing that what I had feared was in fact true.” But it was only when the plane landed and phone messages came in – “ping, ping, ping, ping” – from friends he had long been telling of his concerns that it truly hit him. “The shock was comparable to being told Gabriel was dead. But there was also that anger, about feeling I hadn’t been properly listened to.” He attended a public forum in Barking in early 2016 at which he heard police say they had engaged with the LGBTQ community and had “gay liaison officers”. “But not once was I or Thierry told they even existed. And if they didn’t liaise with us, two openly gay witnesses in the case of an unexplained gay death – who the hell were they liaising with?” Having heard about the experiences of the victims’ families, he said the police conduct seemed worse than he had thought. He added: “Whatever the IPCC come back with, I believe there was homophobia. They judged those four young lads and dismissed their families,” he claimed. “I hope the LGBTQ community see this for what it is.” Pape went to the Old Bailey to witness Port being sentenced. “I sat in the public gallery. And it was satisfying, seeing him go down for life.” The Metropolitan police said it was unable to give answers to specific questions about the investigation due to the ongoing IPCC inquiry, and referred to a statement it released on Port’s conviction. Commander Stuart Cundy, of the Met’s specialist crime and operations command, said part of the IPCC investigation would examine whether discrimination played any part, and highlighted “the great deal of work” the Met has done with LGBT communities.','https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/03/stephen-port-victims-landlord-i-felt-i-hit-a-brick-wall-with-the-police','Stephen Port victim\'s landlord: \'I felt I hit a brick wall with the police\'',445,'uk-news'),('football/2017/jan/03/axel-witsel-tianjin-quanjian-zenit-st-petersburg','Zenit St Petersburg have confirmed Axel Witsel is to join Tianjin Quanjian in the latest high-profile acquisition by a Chinese Super League side.

A series of deadly terror attacks left the entire country fearful, traumatised. There were public funerals in almost every town, but even grief can’t unite a society as polarised as ours. As a nation we now spend more time talking about death than about the joys of life. “Will it be after a football match? Or maybe when I am returning home from work? When will I become a number?” wrote one person on Twitter, reflecting the sentiments of millions of citizens. “Don’t be sad that you couldn’t win the lottery,” said another on social media. “If you are alive, it means you’ve won the biggest lottery in Turkey.” The victims of terrorism are called “martyrs” while the names of urban landmarks are changing, slowly, into Martyrdom Hill or Martyrdom Street. Ministers greet police officers, wishing them to sacrifice themselves for the nation. “God willing, you shall be martyrs too,” says the minister of urbanisation, Mehmet Özhaseki. The government is trying to cover its incompetence in both foreign and domestic policy with the language of jingoism and patriotism. Those who question the official line are labelled “betrayers” and “pawns of western powers”. Young people are told that we are a country surrounded by water on three sides and enemies on all four. As paranoia, distrust and fear intensify, the culture of coexistence dissolves. With such a gloomy year behind us, no wonder many Turks were looking forward to celebrating the arrival of 2017 as a sign of hope and renewal. It was this sliver of optimism that had brought together hundreds in Istanbul’s famous nightclub Reina on New Year’s Eve. It was a mixed group of Turks and foreigners, the kind of diversity that Islamic fanatics hate. The Isis attack, in which 39 people were massacred, took place in a country where the seeds are sown for fanaticism, bigotry and authoritarianism. The rift between the secularists and the religious has grown. In a Friday sermon broadcast to more than 80,000 mosques across the country, Diyanet, the religious affairs directorate, called New Year celebrations “illegitimate”. For weeks prior to New Year’s Eve, ultra-nationalist and Islamist groups had been distributing flyers on the streets saying “Muslims do not celebrate Christian festivals”. An extremist group in the city of Aydin staged a protest play full of hate speech against Christians, in which one of their own who was dressed as Santa Claus was chased and had a gun held to his head. There were billboards in big cities this year with a scary-looking Santa smoking cannabis. “Christmas is a blow to our Muslimhood,” read the slogan. In the city of Van another billboard read: “Did you ever see a Christian celebrating Eid al-Adha? Why are we celebrating their festivals?” Meanwhile, a group of students at Istanbul Technical University gathered to hold up signs that said: “Do not be tempted by Satan. Do not celebrate New Year”; “There is no Christmas in Islam”; “In Muslim lands people are trying to keep alive, in their lands it is all about festivities”. The same group then produced an inflatable Santa Claus, which they first circumcised and then stabbed multiple times. It is of course ironic that St Nicholas, who is vilified by Turkish extremists today as the basis of the Santa Claus legend, was originally from Patara, on Turkey’s Mediterranean coast, and was until recently a source of national pride. Last year poor Santa was politicised and demonised like never before. The Islamist newspaper Milat published a column mocking Santa, claiming the red of his robe was dyed in the blood of the people of Aleppo, and that Santa brought gifts to children in the west while bringing bombs and death to children in Aleppo. And the hate speech did not wither even after the horrific act of cruelty in Reina. Islamist commentators appeared on TV to say: “We are against New Year. We are against drinking alcohol and celebrations. Whoever wants to blow up whatever place may do so.” What is puzzling is how, in a country where anyone who writes anything critical about the government can be instantly sued, and possibly even arrested and put on trial, such religious or nationalist hatemongers rarely have action taken against them – although the government has just announced that 347 social media users who posted comments in support of terror attacks are to be investigated. Such is the atmosphere of intimidation that a prominent journalist, Ahmet Sik, predicted weeks ago that Islamists might target New Year celebrations. Today Sik is in prison, punished for his outspokenness, alongside more than 140 Turkish journalists and intellectuals. The country is at a critical juncture – or perhaps beyond it. Because of the sad loss of democracy within its borders and the repeated mistakes of its AKP government in Syria, because of the turbulence of the Middle East and the changing world scene, our big cities have become a new front for terrorists. Once we thought Turkey would be a shining role model for the Muslim world; now we are worried that our country may in fact be following some of its worst examples.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/03/reina-islamic-fanaticism-turkey-new-years-eve-massacre','The Reina atrocity shows how deeply Islamic fanaticism has taken hold in Turkey | Elif Shafak',447,'commentisfree'),('world/2017/jan/03/germany-outlines-plans-overhaul-security-following-berlin-attack','Germany’s interior ministry is seeking to overhaul the country’s security apparatus and make it easier to deport rejected asylum seekers in the wake of last month’s terrorist attack on a Berlin Christmas market. Outlining a raft of measures in an article for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung , the interior minister, Thomas de Maizière, said recent terror attacks, as well as reports of cyber attacks on the Bundestag, meant “we have to face the fact that our state has to be better prepared for difficult times than it is now”. One step towards such an overhaul would be to centralise the country’s counter-terrorism apparatus, said De Maizière, who is a member of Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party. “We don’t have federal jurisdiction to deal with national catastrophes. The jurisdiction for the fight against international terrorism is fragmented,” he said. “The federal police’s scope of action is restricted to railway stations, airports and border controls,” he wrote, stressing that “it is time” to re-examine Germany’s security setup. Anis Amri, the Tunisian man believed to have been behind the attack at Berlin’s Breitscheidplatz on 19 December, when an articulated lorry was used to plough into a busy Christmas market, had dropped off German security agencies’ radar even though he had been identified as a potential terrorist threat. In the aftermath of the attack some officials pointed to a mix-up of regional competences. “The current remit of the federal police is too limited,” De Maizière wrote. “We need a set of common rules and better coordination, for instance in checking dangerous individuals.” The federal government should be given greater powers to steer domestic intelligence services, said the minister. German authorities have also been criticised for failing to deport Amri, 24, despite his asylum appliction being rejected. Officials in North Rhine-Westphalia said paperwork required to extradite him had only arrived from Tunisia in the days after the attack. In his article published on Tuesday, De Maizière called for a nationwide effort on the issue of deportation, suggesting that centralised departure centres should be set up to hold asylum seekers in the weeks or days leading up to their expulsion. In Italy, where Amri was shot dead during a confrontation with police on 23 December, the new prime minister, Paolo Gentiloni, has signalled a similarly hardened stance on the issue of migrant expulsions. Italy’s police chief, Franco Gabrielli, last Friday sent a two-page directive to police stations across the country ordering them to increase efforts to identify and deport migrants, telling officers to take “extraordinary action” before the “growing migratory pressure in an international context marked by instability and threats” to “control and remove irregular foreigners”. The interior minister, Marco Minniti, plans to open several new detention centres that hold migrants ahead of their expulsion, a ministry source told Reuters.','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/03/germany-outlines-plans-overhaul-security-following-berlin-attack','Germany outlines plans to overhaul security following Berlin attack',448,'world'),('uk-news/davehillblog/2017/jan/03/the-cave-of-wonders-that-is-travel-in-london-report-number-nine','Don’t get too excited by recent “news” that Sadiq Khan is buying no more New Routemaster buses for London’s fleet. After all, he first informed the world that he has dumped the “Boris Bus” near the end of May last year, confirming a manifesto promise he had made loud and often during the mayoral election campaign. Don’t expect them to disappear overnight, either. Of more topical interest is which London public transport fares have not risen in the New Year and which have, a matter for further coverage later this week when the mayor’s budgets come under London Assembly scrutiny. But surpassing even this is for sheer excitement is Transport for London’s ninth annual Travel in London report, 250 pages of fascinating facts that weren’t published eight months ago. Let’s luxuriate in just a few. A public transport success story The big transport trend in London since 2000, when the mayoralty and TfL were created, has been the large fall in private car use and the large rise in that of public transport. The report tells us that in 2015/16, 43% of London households had no access to a car, that the total volume of road traffic in 2015 was 10% lower than in 2000, and that this century has seen the “mode share” of public transport rise from 28% to 37% while that of motorised private transport has fallen from 47% to 36%. Walking, the other big way of getting around the capital, has retained a 24% share. The shift away from cars towards buses, rail and Underground is projected to continue, albeit at a slower rate. Public transport’s share is expected to reach 40% by 2041 and that of cars (and other private motor vehicles) to fall to 30%, with walking inching up to 25%. Trains on track It might give little comfort to those who rely on the services of Southern, but for most users of different types of train travel in the metropolis, things have got bigger and better. Underground capacity and reliability continued to go up in 2015/16, Overground use rose by 32% and the report even remarks that “general reliability of National Rail has improved” over time, though it politely observes that “available capacity into central London during the weekday morning peak remains a major constraint”. Customer satisfaction measurements, including for the Docklands Light Railway (DLR), are all significantly higher than they were five years ago. Underground, surface rail and DLR combined accounted for 24% of all individual journey stages in 2015 (see pie chart on page 30) with the former two quintessential to travel between outer and central London: some 84% of all complete trips are by rail or Underground, says the report. Bus troubles The report says that people used a bus to get from A to B an estimated 3.9 million times every week in 2015. Yet this reflected the first fall in bus ridership by that measure since 2006, which was the only previous one since 1995 (see table 2.2 on page 27). Service reliability has suffered lately too. These as yet small yet worrying developments are described as being “in line with a rise in general traffic congestion”, which is explored in chapter 6. TfL’s “congestion pie” representation (page 170) has slices for accidents (9%), road and street works (7%) and “spillages and crane operations” (5%), but by far the biggest portion is labelled simply “excess traffic” (75%). It puts the financial cost of congestion in 2015 on the big “red route” London roads TfL is responsible for at £1.3b, up 8% compared with 2014. The bus, London’s cheapest form of public transport and the one used by the widest range of Londoners, especially in Inner London, is another congestion casualty. Walking, cycling and “healthy streets” Take a look at chapter 5, which introduces an “an over-arching framework for the design and management of London’s streets” aimed at facilitating active travel, reducing car dependency and tackling poor air quality. Ten “healthy streets” outcomes are set out and the role the transport system can play in improving peoples’ health is explained. Sadly, the report’s statistics show that too few of us get around the city in ways that involve exercise, even if we are young. Although there’s lots of walking, not enough of it is of sufficient duration to do us much good. The amount of cycling has more than doubled this century, nearly trebling in central London, but its mode share for both complete trips and individual journey stages across Greater London as a whole was just 2% in 2015, the same figure as for the previous ten years. It is hoped that new and future cycling provision will help push that number up to 6% by 2041. There’s a lot more on transport’s environmental performance in Chapter 8. The above are but little samples of the treasures to be found in the cave of wonders that is Travel in London report number nine. Read the whole thing here (pdf).

Ray Bassett, the former ambassador to Canada, called on Ireland to toughen up its position, arguing the government needed to stop being so loyal to Brussels and vocalise the potential destruction Brexit posed. Bassett, the first Irish diplomat to call for a breaking of ranks, said: “Nothing will be served by not confronting forcefully, the ‘punish the Brits’ elements in Brussels. “Having been involved in many negotiations, I can say confidently that the difficult party usually gets accommodated.” He said Ireland could not rely on federalists within Europe to advocate its case, and with no allies outside Britain, it needed to launch its own campaign for a soft Brexit with access to the single market and immigration controls. Bassett, who was previously involved in Northern Ireland peace talks and served as joint secretary of the British-Irish secretariat in Belfast, is the first former diplomat to call for a shift in negotiation position. Writing in the Sunday Business Post, he said the Irish government’s determination to remain as close as possible to the line being taken by the 26 other member states was “at odds” with the national interest. Earlier this year, Irish business leaders and former politicians including the former taoiseach John Bruton warned of the economic “disaster” Brexit could cause given that the UK is the country’s single biggest export market. The former ambassador says the country will find itself alone without any natural allies when Britain leaves the EU, and Brussels has shown “in the infamous bailout and other matters” that “Ireland’s national interest does not carry much weight nowadays”. This was a reference to threats made by the European Central Bank to stop cash flow to the country unless it bailed out private bondholders during the 2010 crash. “We simply cannot leave out interest in the hands of people like former EU commissioner Michel Barnier, a noted federalist,” said Bassett, in reference to the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator. “Instead of bleating about a common EU position, we should be convening meetings in Dublin at heads of government level with like-minded countries such as the Nordics, Netherlands etc that have a powerful self-interest in Britain getting as good a deal as possible,” he said. Publicly, Ireland is remaining loyal to the other 26 member states. In December the taoiseach, Enda Kenny, rejected a call from the House of Lords for the EU to allow a bilateral deal between Dublin and Brussels because of the unique dangers. “A bilateral deal is not being examined,” he said. Days earlier, the government’s European affairs minister, Dara Murphy, called the House of Lords plan “nonsensical”. Bassett called on the Irish government to break ranks with its EU partners. “Ireland needs to position itself as the leader of the countries wanting as soft a Brexit as possible,” he said, adding that the taoiseach should also support Britain’s position on controls on immigration, something Europe has already said is non-negotiable. A spokesperson for the Irish embassy in London said: “Ray Bassett recently retired after a long and distinguished career in DFAT [the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]. He never worked at a senior level on EU issues, but any contribution to the Brexit debate is of course welcome. “The government has been consistently clear that it wants to maintain the very strong links between Ireland and Britain in the context of the closest possible EU-UK relationship. Supporting the integrity, unity and effectiveness of the EU itself is also a key national priority for us as one of 27 remaining member states. “Of course, at this stage we are all waiting for the British government to set out its vision of the future relationship.”','https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/03/ireland-should-not-rule-out-leaving-eu-says-ex-diplomat-ray-bassett','Ireland should not rule out leaving EU, says ex-diplomat',450,'politics'),('uk-news/2017/jan/03/mod-names-british-soldier-killed-in-iraq-scott-hetherington','A British soldier killed in Iraq is believed to have been shot after another member of the UK force accidentally discharged a weapon at the Taji base, north of Baghdad.

The French capital is competing to pick up any business lost by the City as a result of the UK’s vote to leave the EU. Frankfurt and Dublin are among the other EU cities seeking to attract business and jobs from London. Europlace, the French lobby group, is setting out its stall on the basis it already employs 180,000 financiers – more than Frankfurt and Dublin combined – and says it has the skills required to rehouse financial operations. In the run-up to the 23 June referendum, banks warned they might have to move business in the event of a vote to leave. Paris was mentioned by Britain’s biggest bank, HSBC, which said it could shift 1,000 roles there. The US bank JP Morgan said it could move 4,000 of its 19,000 UK workforce but did not specify where the roles might go. Barclays already has a subsidiary in Dublin. Arnaud de Bresson, Europlace’s managing director, told Bloomberg that decisions would be made shortly. “We feel decisions will be taken in the first semester of the new year ... We see institutions are accelerating their process of thinking,” he said. Theresa May has pledged to trigger article 50, the formal two-year mechanism for exiting the EU, in March. The process is being watched closely by financiers who want to continue to have “passporting” access to the remaining 27 members of the EU. There have been calls for transitional arrangements to give companies time to adapt to the new trading relationships and predictions that banks could make announcements about contingency arrangements in February, when they announce their financial results. Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JP Morgan, said in an interview published on Tuesday that any job moves would be gradual. “We’ve been planning for a range of outcomes because it’s still as uncertain as a couple months ago. What we know now is that this will be a slow process, and all the staff moves would not happen at once but over a period of years,” Dimon told Financial News. But he said: “If there is not a clear transitional period decided early in the process, where passporting rules still apply for a few years after negotiations, then we’d likely have to accelerate our timetable in complying with new rules.” Dimon added: “I wish we could keep it all here [in London]. I think it’s very good for Europe. I think the efficiencies of the financial markets here accrue to Europe, too, because they get all those efficiencies embedded in how products are priced.” Bank of England officials have said the EU as a whole could lose out as a result of Brexit, while New York, already a major financial centre, could benefit. Dimon said he hoped “rational heads” would prevail, saying the EU had been good for peace and for economic prosperity. “A major fear to me about Brexit is that it causes the EU to fail down the road,” he said.','https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/03/paris-lobby-city-london-firms-decide-leave-uk-within-weeks-brexit','Paris lobby predicts City firms will make decision on moving within weeks',452,'business'),('football/2017/jan/03/paul-clement-appointed-swansea-city-manager','Paul Clement has signed a 2½-year deal to become Swansea City’s manager and will “restore some much-needed pride”, according to Huw Jenkins.

Clement met the Swansea players at their hotel in London before Tuesday night’s 2-1 win at Crystal Palace. He is due to take training on Wednesday before being announced at a press conference at the Liberty Stadium on Thursday. “I would like to think my footballing philosophy goes hand in hand with the club’s,” Clement told Swansea’s website. “That’s part of the reason the club chose me and a big part of the reason why I wanted to come to the club.

Maybe that hasn’t been there so much over recent times, but hopefully I will be able to put my imprint on the team very quickly and the fans will be able to see some good football – most importantly some winning football.” Clement’s managerial experience is limited to the eight months he spent at Derby County last season but the 44-year-old has coached at some of Europe’s biggest clubs, including Chelsea, Real Madrid, Paris Saint-German and, more recently, Bayern Munich, working closely with Carlo Ancelotti. “I could have stayed at Bayern as an assistant but I’ve chosen to come into a very challenging situation,” he said. “It excites me to do that and that’s the attitude I want the players to have. It’s a big task but I think it can be done.” Jenkins hopes that Swansea will reap the rewards from Clement’s CV: “Swansea City’s strength over many years had been the quality of the football coached on the training field,” he said. “That has always been at the forefront of our success. There is no doubt in my mind that Paul can not only help us regain that footballing belief, but also restore some much needed pride back into the football club. “Everyone connected to the club is fully behind the appointment and we see this a typical Swansea City choice. It looks a good fit to get us back on track and provide one of the best young coaches in Europe with the chance to develop his own career and become a leading coach in his own right. I’m sure every Swans supporter, like me, would want to wish Paul the best of luck at the club and that he enjoys his time with us at Swansea.” Clement becomes Swansea’s third manager of the season. Francesco Guidolin was sacked in October and Bob Bradley, the Italian’s replacement, was dismissed on 27 December, after losing seven of his 11 matches.','https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jan/03/paul-clement-appointed-swansea-city-manager','Swansea job excites Paul Clement: ‘It’s a big task but I think it can be done’',453,'football'),('money/2017/jan/03/green-energy-uk-launches-first-time-of-day-electricity-tariff','Householders who charge their gadgets, wash their clothes and run their dishwashers overnight will pay less for their energy under a new dual-fuel tariff. Green Energy UK said its TIDE tariff is the first to offer residential customers an electricity price based on the time of day, although the idea will be familiar to anyone on an Economy 7 or Economy 10 tariff. Under the deal launched this week, customers will pay 4.9p per unit of electricity on weekdays from 11pm-6am, but five times as much between the peak weekday hours of 4-7pm. The average price of electricity in the UK is around 14p per unit. Consumer groups and campaigners welcomed the tariff, but said it would not be for everyone. Doug Stewart, the CEO of Green Energy UK, which has 20,000 customers, said the deal offered a savvy way for people to bring down their bill rather than trying to find the cheapest tariff with a “new-on-the-block supplier”. “If we are to learn anything from GB Energy’s failure, it’s that cheapest tariffs are unprofitable and unsustainable,” he said of the collapse of another small energy supplier last November. “The mantra of ‘switch to the lowest tariff’ has done nothing for energy efficiency and encourages higher use by those who can’t necessarily afford it.” The tariff is underpinned by smart meters, which the government has pledged to fit in every home by the end of 2020, although official figures recently showed only 9% have been installed so far. Around four in 10 of Green Energy UK’s customers already have smart meters, which are a prerequisite for the tariff. Martin Lewis of Money Saving Expert said the deal looked good on his first analysis, though the gas price of 3.59p per unit was expensive. “If you are a medium to heavy user who uses far more electricity than gas and you could shift your usage overnight, then this will be a winner. If you’ve got storage heaters, timers, a smart home and you put your dishwasher, washing machine and storage heaters on [overnight], then it’s not a bad deal,” he said. Gillian Guy, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “Time-of-use tariffs can be a good deal for those who can be flexible about when they use electricity at home. Some people will be able to make changes in order to save money, such as cooking or washing clothes at off-peak times. “But for others – for example, families with young children – it could be more difficult to change when they use electricity.” Alex Neill, the managing director of Which? Home &amp; Legal Services, said: “It’s good to see innovative tariffs being introduced and this will hopefully become much more common, particularly with the roll out of smart meters.” Time-of-day tariffs are also seen as a way to solve potential headaches for the National Grid as more renewable but intermittent sources of power such as wind and solar are brought online. British Gas last year offered customers a day of free electricity a week in a bid to encourage them to sign up for smart meters. Lewis was critical of British Gas for installing smart meters that other suppliers are unable to operate, but he welcomed the rise of time-of-day tariffs and said the Green Energy UK offer was “not a bad predictor of the future”. “Ultimately, the more people are on these tariffs, it doesn’t just benefit them it, it benefits others, too, because it smoothes out demand curves. If we have smoother demand curves then we need less power stations on tap, which brings overall prices down. So, yes, this should be encouraged,” he said.','https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/jan/03/green-energy-uk-launches-first-time-of-day-electricity-tariff','Green Energy UK offers first electricity tariff based on time of day',454,'money'),('culture/2017/jan/03/myspace-celebrities-tyler-creator-taylor-swift-tom-hardy','Last week, a Reddit user uncovered an old Myspace page from 2008 entitled I Smell Panties. It contained a song called Lilo Fucks Stitch in which, over a rudimentary piano backing, the performer assumes the role of the beloved Disney character Stitch and details all the sexually transmitted diseases he caught following intercourse with his owner Lilo. It turns out that the page was made and abandoned by the rapper Tyler, the Creator. It’s unclear how mortified Tyler will be by this discovery – after all, it’s no saltier than much of his commercially available work – but it’s by no means the first pre-fame celebrity Myspace page to rise from the depths and haunt its creator. There are others. So many others. Tom Hardy The Dark Knight Rises star’s Myspace page is a golden demonstration of everything that can happen if you free a celebrity from the clutches of publicists. It is at once utterly barmy (“I am a goldfish walking through the desert,” it reads, shortly after the bit that goes: “I could so easily be dead. My head is like a dangerous neighborhood I should never be in it without an appropriate adult”) and perfectly glorious. There are photos of Tom, but the vast majority of them show him in just his pants, duckfacing like his very life depended on it. There is a sense these days that Tom Hardy is doing his best to escape the abject sluttishness of his Myspace presence, in order to reach the giddy heights of respectability. This is genuinely a crying shame. Harry Styles In its current and unusably terrible incarnation, Myspace is basically a repository for three-year-old Harry Styles fansites. However, this is the original and best. Created when he was basically a child, Harry’s page contains five photos, two of which are identical chin-stroking Andy Warhol montages. There’s a blurry selfie taken in a mirror, camera flash and all. There’s a photo at dinner. But, best of all, there’s a picture with his parents. His mum and dad are simply smiling for the camera. Harry, though, is pulling a face like Jim Carrey in The Mask and daring us to imagine what a megastar he’s about to become. Unlike many celebrity Myspace pages, Harry’s is still publicly accessible. This is entirely to his credit. Taylor Swift Made when she was just 18, Swift’s Myspace bio reads like the confessional scene from a Nora Ephron film translated from English to Chinese and back again several thousand times. It’s like a Hank Kingsley tone poem. “In my spare time, I like to conduct random baking experiments in my kitchen and write letters to people,” it goes. And “I love surprises and hardwood floors”. And “I like to read up on weird medical problems, so if one of my friends ever complains of a headache or stomach ache, I’m probably going to spout off 12 different things that could be wrong with them. Because I’m way paranoid.” And “I’m not a big deal. At all”. Katy Perry Perry joined Myspace just as she became famous, but her old page still feels ramshackle and homemade. It boasts of appearances on webisodes and mentions in Penthouse. Its “Things to know about Katy Perry” section includes both “Not a vegetarian, but drives a hybrid :) hee hee” and “I LOVE rollerskating, MINATURE GOLF and ice skating :)”. Perhaps the most galling signifier of the age, however, is the fact that one of her top friends is Mika. Lana Del Rey Lana Del Rey’s Myspace page commits many crimes. Most egregiously, the page was made when Lana Del Rey was simply known as Lizzy Grant. Then there are her listed influences, which at one point included “Coney Island”, “Britney Spears” and “Motorcycles”. Worst of all, though, Lana Del Rey’s preferred choice of font was Impact, which meant you couldn’t look at it for more than five seconds without getting a cluster migraine. Tom Hiddleston Correctly deleted at the moment he became famous, Hiddleston’s Myspace offers a tantalizing peek at a tormented soul. The results of his Superhero Personality Test reveal him to be 85% The Flash and 67% Supergirl. He lists his general interests as “the usual”, which clearly means he has no general interests. Also, it’s very important to point out that one of his favorite films is listed as Meet the Fockers.','https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/jan/03/myspace-celebrities-tyler-creator-taylor-swift-tom-hardy','When celebrities used Myspace: the profiles A-listers try to forget',455,'culture'),('tv-and-radio/2017/jan/03/new-celebrity-apprentice-schwarzenegger-premiere','You have to be – perhaps you always had to be – a certain type of person to watch The New Celebrity Apprentice. Perhaps that’s the kind of person who understands why they felt the need to rebrand it “The New” once Donald Trump had successfully used it to vault into the White House; or the kind of person who needs a montage to be reminded that Arnold Schwarzenegger was a bodybuilder who also starred in the Terminator movies and Twins before the show starts; or the kind of person whose vision of southern California can be defined, as it is in one interstitial, by a beautiful woman picking her bathing suit wedgie as the sun sets. This is America in 2017, and all we can do is stare at former reality show contestants, pop stars, a “YouTube celebrity” and sports figures ostentatiously chewing Trident gum and wonder at the reality that “brands” have wrought upon this great nation. Or we can just listen to Schwarzenegger intone his most famous lines – “I’m back”, “You’re terminated”, “Hasta la vista, baby” and “Crush your enemies, see them driven before you” (which is from Conan the Barbarian and the functional equivalent of trying to make “fetch” happen) – and let ourselves be lulled into the fantasy that people more famous than us know what’s best. The contestants this year, unless you’ve spent a lot of time already watching reality shows or televised sports, need some introductions. Sure, there’s actor Jon Lovitz, Boy George, Mötley Crüe’s Vince Neal and Wilson Phillips’ Carnie Wilson. But there’s also two retired football players (Eric Dickerson and Ricky Williams), boxer Laila Ali, retired WNBA player and former Olympian Lisa Leslie and former MMA fighter (and convicted money launderer) Chael Sonnen. And then there’s the reality show contingent: Matt Iseman (American Ninja Warrior host), Carson Kressley (Queer Eye for the Straight Guy), Brooke Burke-Chavet (Dancing with the Stars), Kyle Richards (Real Housewives of Beverly Hills), Carrie Keagan (the “YouTube celebrity”), Nicole “Snookie” Polizzi (Jersey Shore) and Porsha Williams (Real Housewives of Atlanta). Schwarzenegger’s advisers are Tyra Banks and, in keeping with the Trump tradition of incorporating family, Schwarzenegger’s nephew, entertainment lawyer Patrick Knapp Schwarzenegger. No surprise: the first challenge was to help out Banks’s new make-up project, Tyra Beauty, which promises to “transform your face in five minutes with six products”, all in stick form. They split the contestants into two teams, men (Team Arete) and women (Team Prima), and the teams got to work designing an introductory event. Williams was made project manager of Team Prima, whose planning session was more focused on the aesthetics of the presentation than the content. At the event, Prima elected to have the models apply their own make-up, to demonstrate the ease of the five-minute face, with Burke-Chavet hosting. Boy George helmed Team Arete, but Kressley was the stand-out player, coming up with their slogan – “I came, I saw, I contoured” – on the fly. They decided that their gimmick would be to show how easy it is by having the straight guys (Iseman, Dickerson, Williams, Sonnen, Neil and Lovitz) apply the products on the models at the event while explaining more about the line. Back in the boardroom after the presentations, Banks said that Prima had great energy but missed some of the talking points, and that she thought it was wrong that none of the women on the team actually used the products themselves. Team Arete, on the other hand, demonstrated more knowledge of the product, and she liked that each man came out to sell the products. Schwarzenegger declared Team Arete the winner, and the women were left to battle it out. They instead argued about why they should not have lost, and only Keagan, who had been shown playing around on her phone during the planning session, threw anyone under the bus: Williams, the project manager. Williams put Keagan and Polizzi up for elimination and, in the elimination round, nominated Polizzi. But Schwarzenegger had other ideas, noting that Keagan consistently said in the evaluations that she’d done what was asked of her. “You maybe have watched previous shows,” he said, in an obvious reference to Trump, “and those did what was required stayed on for a longer period of time, but that’s not how I handle things. Who is taking the most risk is really what it comes down to, so therefore Carrie, you’re terminated. “Now, get to the chopper.” Both are, of course, lines from his films, though eliminated stars are, apparently, driven to an airfield and helicoptered … somewhere over Los Angeles. But while Keagan was done, viewers were not: it was a special, two-hour premiere, and so there was yet another contest. In the second half, contestants were brought to the El Capitan Theater on Hollywood Boulevard because something-something about smiles. Anyway, it was a totally random lead-in for a contest to write a song and shoot a video for Trident gum’s new ad campaign, celebrating many different kinds of smiles. Prima, of course, choose Carnie Wilson as project manager, but it was Kyle Richards who came up with the video concept: Ali’s “knock-out” smile. They decided to shoot a video in which Polizzi chews a bunch of gum and knocks Ali out with her smile, over Leslie’s objections that they were ignoring the “many smiles” part of the concept. Leslie ended up shooting and then having to reshoot the video, while Williams directed and Wilson and Richards worked on the song. It came down to the wire in editing, but they ended up with a video with which everyone but Leslie was happy. Arete picked Lovitz as team leader and then had to talk him out of starting the video with a joke about British people having bad teeth. Instead, they came up with filming something that makes each of them smile and, leaving Boy George and Neil to the song, headed out to Venice Beach to shoot. Boy George and Neil worked well together until the editing process, during which Neil started drinking wine and Boy George, a recovering addict, objected and began rolling his eyes. Their editing process was also fraught, and Boy George was unhappy with the amateurish final result. During the screenings, the women felt confident but Kressley and Lovitz both noticed that the Trident people had zero reaction to the men’s video, which made them nervous. In the boardroom, Team Prima talked about how the concept came into being but Leslie admitted to Schwarzenegger that she didn’t think it was the right concept. When Arnold turned to the men, several of the women started to bicker about Leslie’s objections and Schwarzenegger had to silence them with a look. The major objection to the men’s video seemed to be that Iseman was smiling while eating wings, though Boy George and Neil aired their differences over Neil’s drinking in the studio (which went from “one glass of wine” to “a couple glasses of wine”) and Boy George’s defense of his sobriety. Still, Knapp Schwarzenegger said that the executives loved the core message, how the men leveraged their celebrity and how they incorporated many smiles, but that they hated the production values. Banks told Prima that the executives loved the women’s videography and production values, but they felt the plot overtook the branding message and the everyday smiles concept – which had been Leslie’s point. Team Arete won again, and Wilson looked totally devastated. The women again argued with being in the bottom, and stood by their concept. Leslie and Williams suggested that, if the concept was off, Richards should be in the bottom, but Polizzi, for the second boardroom in a row, tried to dodge the question and earned Schwarzenegger’s ire. He not only mocked her for being unwilling to make hard choices, but suggested she could be fired for it, until Wilson interrupted and said that she was ready to place Leslie and Polizzi in the bottom. Returning to the boardroom, Schwarzenegger asked Wilson what her thinking was in nominating Leslie and Polizzi for elimination, when it was Richards who missed boat on the concept. Wilson said that Richards put more effort in than anyone else, but Leslie countered by standing up both for herself and Polizzi. Arnold said that there’s no reason to fire Leslie or Polizzi, so it’s Wilson on the chopping block. “Hasta la vista, baby,” he said. “Get to the chopper.” Look: it makes more sense if you never actually saw Predator, and only recognize it as part of his brand.','https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/03/new-celebrity-apprentice-schwarzenegger-premiere','The New Celebrity Apprentice: Arnie terminates low-grade stars in premiere',456,'tv-and-radio'),('politics/2017/jan/03/rogers-resignation-is-latest-sign-britain-is-heading-for-hard-brexit','The resignation of Britain’s ambassador to the European Union is seen on both sides of the ever-widening Channel as a sobering reminder that the country is heading for the hardest of Brexits. Regardless of whether he was pushed or chose to jump, Sir Ivan Rogers was more than just the government’s representative in Brussels. He was also Britain’s best hope of a negotiated compromise with other member states over the terms of its departure. For hardliners in Westminster, the resignation will be seen as a late Christmas present. The Tory right has long accused Rogers of offering “little but doom and gloom” by focusing on the gulf between what they believe could be achieved through determined British bargaining and what the other 27 governments want. Rogers, a former private secretary to the Tory Europhile Kenneth Clarke, was accused of letting down David Cameron by not pushing harder for EU concessions during the run-up to the referendum. A new book on the period claims Rogers threatened to resign several times during the painful process. Revelations that our man in Brussels had recently warned that exit negotiations could drag on for a decade may have proved to be the final straw – both for exasperated ministers and beleaguered civil servants who saw little upside in being proved right. But just because Eurosceptics do not regard his departure as a surprise does not mean it should be regarded as without consequence. The news is being met with consternation by many experts on European affairs who see it as a sign that Britain is no longer interested in hearing bad news, regardless of consequences. “Hardline Eurosceptics criticised him for advising Cameron on the limits of what he could ask for in his renegotiation, but he told the truth – that the 27 were not prepared to give more than they offered,” said Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform. “Those who tell the truth are not always popular and thus Ivan became unpopular with large parts of the Tory party. One may question whether he would have resigned if he had not felt that he lost the confidence of No 10.” The pro-EU policy establishment is easily dismissed by Brexiters as another group of experts who are incapable of imagining the benefits of independence. Yet Rogers was regarded in Brussels as among one of the more Eurosceptic British occupants of the post in recent decades. A more confident British negotiating team should in theory have been happy to have an expert in its ranks who was capable of seeing where the room for manoeuvre lay. “No other official or adviser or minister near the top of the British government came near to matching Ivan’s expertise on the EU,” said Grant. “He was one of the few people at the top of the British government who understood how the EU worked and what other EU leaders thought and felt. [Theresa] May and her ministers will sorely miss his expertise.” The former EU commissioner Peter Mandelson said: “In terms of knowledge and experience of the EU, Sir Ivan Rogers is second to none in Whitehall. His resignation is a serious loss for us in Brussels. “Our negotiation as a whole will go nowhere if ministers are going to delude themselves about the immense difficulty and challenges Britain faces in implementing the referendum decision.” It looks as if Rogers was hounded from office not for the crime of disloyalty but because he was too negative – not capable of seeing the opportunities that May claims are around the corner. Signs continue to abound that British Eurosceptics still inhabit an entirely different planet, let alone continent, from everyone else in 2017. Earlier on Tuesday, Michael Gove’s thinktank Change Britain claimed that far from destroying trade, leaving the EU customs union would create 400,000 jobs by allowing hitherto unrecognised opportunities in the rest of the world – a claim dismissed as “fantasy figures” by the rival group Open Britain. In this context, Rogers represented a dangerous tendency to try to bridge the divide. For politicians on either side, it will now be that little bit easier to shout past each other rather than seek common ground. Grant concluded: “Britain’s partners will take this as a sign that May’s government is heading for a hard Brexit which puts sovereignty ahead of economic integration with the EU.”','https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/03/rogers-resignation-is-latest-sign-britain-is-heading-for-hard-brexit','Rogers resignation is latest sign Britain is heading for hard Brexit',457,'politics'),('commentisfree/2017/jan/03/will-and-grace-back-gay-life-sitcom-series','Honey – as one Karen Walker might say – what’s this, what’s happening, what’s going on? What indeed. After testing the water with a brief reunion during the US presidential campaign, Will &amp; Grace is to return for a new 10-part series, a decade after its conclusion. The welcome return of a sparkling and witty favourite of yesteryear? Or the desperate revival of an old sitcom designed to halt an inexorable slide in ratings and audience flight from network TV to Netflix? While we could debate this either/or, cynic v optimist binary for ages, instead let us consider the wisdom of reviving a sitcom at all – even, or perhaps especially, one as beloved as Will &amp; Grace. The benefits are clear – it’s an established brand. It’s the same reason that classic books are adapted time and again. But a revival also risks sullying the original. Catching a repeat of an episode by chance or browsing YouTube for clips is one thing – nostalgia is an anaesthetic against the pain of the present – but a whole new series, and a decade later? That makes even fans of the original show uneasy. (See also: The X-Files). Never mind that the history of TV isn’t exactly awash with stories of how classic sitcoms were successfully revived to rave reviews – obviously we’ll have to wait and see how the BBC’s reheated Porridge goes down – there’s something more fundamental to any such revival. And it’s the anxiety that it will be dad-dancing embarrassing, that it will suggest that the original perhaps wasn’t as classic as we thought, that our taste wasn’t as impeccable as we imagined it to be. Because comedy occupies a different place in the heart to drama – perhaps because laughing is a treat and funny things are especially special – watching a favourite sitcom being resurrected reminds us more easily who we were, and possibly how easily pleased or naive we were, or how little attention we actually paid to it. It forces us to accept either that our favourite sitcom wasn’t all that good to begin with – I had this tortured epiphany, back in the day, with Are You Being Served? – or that the passage of time is as unkind to our favourite TV shows as it is to ourselves. To every thing there is a season – and some things have seven seasons or more. So, to put it bluntly, you can worry either that you’re closer to death than you were when you last watched a new episode of Will &amp; Grace, or that the new Will &amp; Grace will seem outmoded, even naff. Because I’m frightened of serious subjects, I shall be going for option two. Will &amp; Grace will, in its new incarnation, most likely seem terribly old-fashioned – not least in that aspect that was its most groundbreaking at the time. When it began, Will &amp; Grace’s representation of gay life – through Will and Jack – was extraordinary, especially in a network sitcom. In straight-acting Will and camptastic Jack, two facets of gay male identity were in people’s living rooms in primetime, as if that were entirely normal. That in itself seemed like a victory. They were just sitcom characters, as archetypal and larger-than-life as any straight ones. Unapologetic and, even when they were miserable, happy. (Of course they were happy – they lived in a sitcom). That the once-groundbreaking Will &amp; Grace now seems like an antique in terms of gay representation is both a tribute to and a curse on the show. From Transparent to Orange Is the New Black, Modern Family to Cucumber and Banana, Last Tango in Halifax to Emmerdale, the sheer variety of gay life on the contemporary screen is impressive. It also illuminates as ridiculous the idea that depicting two metropolitan privileged white men could somehow be a victory for gay visibility. In breaking all that ground when it did, Will &amp; Grace may just have dug a grave for itself now.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/03/will-and-grace-back-gay-life-sitcom-series','Will & Grace is back.

Mackenzie was chosen from a shortlist of candidates to take over from Jean-Luc Choplin, Paris city hall said on Tuesday. Her appointment is supported by the capital’s mayor, Anne Hidalgo. Mackenzie, 59, is currently artistic director of the Holland festival. Her appointment needs the approval of the theatre’s administrative board, which meets on 11 January. A city hall spokesperson said the final decision would be made “in the weeks to come”, but that it was unlikely that Mackenzie’s nomination would be overturned. Mackenzie, CBE, was director of the Cultural Olympiad in 2012, and has previously been drama officer for the Arts Council, dramatic director of the Vienna festival, general director of the Manchester international festival and the Scottish opera and a special adviser to the UK department of culture. Bruno Julliard, deputy mayor in charge of culture, said Mackenzie had proposed a “programme of events open to all musical genres, innovative and multi-disciplined productions”. Julliard indicated she was chosen for also stressing the importance of digital arts, which he said would take the theatre into “as yet unexplored territory”. The Châtelet will close in March for a €31.5m (£26.7m) facelift – €5m of which has been raised by public donations – which is expected to take 28 months. But the theatre is already planning events at outside venues. The first to be announced is a new 47-show run of its hit musical production, Singin’ in the Rain, under the glass nave of the city’s Grand Palais in November this year. Choplin, a self-confessed devotee of classic American musicals, directed the Châtelet for a decade before standing down last year, and oversaw classic productions of My Fair Lady, Kiss Me Kate, A Little Night Music, Sweeney Todd and 42nd Street. The shows were usually sell-outs with most of the audiences made up of French theatregoers. An appeal for candidates to replace Choplin was launched last summer. The jury set up to select a successor said on Tuesday it had interviewed “several candidates of a very high quality”.','https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jan/03/pariss-chatelet-theatre-lines-up-ruth-mackenzie-as-new-artistic-director','Paris’s Châtelet theatre lines up Ruth Mackenzie as new artistic director',459,'stage'),('us-news/2017/jan/03/gentrification-washington-dc-housing-topa-right-to-buy','Vera Watson’s one-bedroom apartment in Washington DC’s Chinatown is bursting with memories: family photos, graduation pictures and objects of all kinds celebrating the Redskins, the capital city’s football team. “There’s nothing like living in your home,” the 60-year-old retired security agent declares softly. Watson has been living in the same 302-unit low-income building named Museum Square for over three decades. She says she has brought up a daughter, nieces, nephews, and grandchildren here. A discreet woman with clear underlying strength and wit, she charmingly apologizes for not putting her teeth in for our meeting, before continuing. “I just love it. I am going to be here until they take me out.” It is unclear whether Watson is joking about being dragged out feet first – insinuating she will be here until she dies – or referring to being forced out through other means. Perhaps she doesn’t quite know, either; the question has been on her mind a lot the last three years. First, her landlord, Bush Companies, stopped accepting Section 8 vouchers – a change in policy that was resolved by tenants securing other forms of government-issued subsidies. Next, her landlord informed residents of its intention to demolish the entire structure and build a far more luxurious building in its stead. Watson and her neighbors were being kicked out. (Bush Companies were contacted for interview and comment on this article but did not respond.) But Watson, who now heads her building’s tenants’ association, hasn’t gone anywhere; and, thanks to the use of a 1980 Tenants Opportunity to Purchase Act (shortened as TOPA), part of the Rental Housing Conversion and Sale Act, she is fighting back. When she first realized her landlord no longer wanted to rent to her community, which is three-quarters Chinese and a quarter African American, despair struck. “I thought: why are they doing this to us low-income people? Where are we going to go from here? Look at how many people you’ve got out here who are homeless. You going to add to that?” At an accelerated pace over the last 15 years, new residents have been slowly gentrifying Washington. They are legions of wealthier, mostly white workers who are increasingly choosing DC, not its suburbs, as their home. On the streets surrounding low-income Museum Square, residents have been thrilled to see cafes and supermarkets pop up within walking distance. “We saw the neighborhood at its worst. Now that it’s at its best, we want to keep being in our community,” Watson says. Thanks to TOPA, luck, and the law, may well be on her side. Once broken down in simplified terms, the TOPA process is remarkably straightforward. Building owners wanting to sell tenant-occupied buildings in the district are required by law to inform their tenants and give them the right to buy their building at market rate – under what is legally referred to as a bona fide offer – before anyone else. If tenants cannot afford to pool their own money together and fully buy the building themselves – a reality in most cases – there are other steps that can be taken for a successful outcome. Organized under a tenants’ association, renters will then tend to contact third party developers (of the not-for-profit or for-profit kind), explains Carolyn Gallaher, a professor of political geography at American University who wrote a book on the subject. Eventually, the tenants’ association, having bargained with different potential new developers (and often played them against each other) and struck a deal to their liking, will cede their right to buy to this third party developer, who will then buy the building off the original landlord on their behalf. Tenants can then decide to convert to a co-op or a condo, or remain renters, Gallaher says. “The cool thing about TOPA is its a right-to-buy program that doesn’t look like Margaret Thatcher’s right to buy. You don’t have to actually buy your unit. The tenants’ association is buying the building, and then they get to decide what they want to do with it.” In other cases still, tenants may have agreed to a future buyout. And as much as this may sound like a negative outcome to anti-displacement advocates, the reality is the buyout they will have negotiated will be more likely to be large. “It may be that everyone gets $100,000 and then they leave; they’re certainly not going to leave with $10,000. But without TOPA, without that process, they wouldn’t have any leverage here,” Gallaher says. This is where the law’s architecture starts to pose practical questions, as well as philosophical and ethical ones. In terms of housing, it empowers tenants within the marketplace and gives them a leg up to meet the market on its own level, rather than creating standalone, robust laws requiring the market to drastically adjust downwards – or across. “It’s a market solution, used for non-market ends,” Gallaher puts it. In a study of seven buildings where renters used TOPA as a tool to stay put after 2000, Gallaher found that an average of half of the units remained occupied by the same tenants. This translates into an estimated 1,527 people being able to keep their homes – in her small sample alone. The tenant-geared law may not be perfect in all its outcomes, but still, it is a twist in the usual gentrification rhetoric, which is often described as an unstoppable and sometimes even “natural” force – however tragic, or even wrong. So far, the Watson-headed tenants’ association of Museum Square is half way through the TOPA process. Seizing on their right to buy first, Watson and fellow tenants have managed to stay put by claiming the number ($250m) issued by their landlord as a sale price did not constitute a bona fide offer – meaning it did not represent the building’s current market value (the number instead reflected the estimated value of the luxury building that would have been built in its stead). Both times they have gone to court in the last two years, they have had rulings in their favor. Even if they are only halfway through using the TOPA process, it is not insignificant that technical elements of the law have already meant that tenants have been able to stay put at least two years into their landlord wanting them out, even if a little over a quarter of the units have been vacated, says Caroline Hennessy, a tenant services specialist with Housing Counseling Services who has been working with Museum Square residents. Jenny Tang, a 45-year-old Chinese resident of the building, says that those neighbors of hers who have decided to leave over the last three years did so after responding to explicit encouragement by their landlord. The landlord especially targeted non-English speaking and elderly residents, she says, who felt particularly vulnerable, despite the law – including language access laws – being on their side. “People from the landlord’s office, they come knocking on doors. They tell people they have to get out. They make people frightened.” Tang, who speaks fluent English as well as Cantonese and Mandarin, is able to help with translation and has tried to act as a coordinator between English-speaking and Chinese non-English-speaking residents. She says she is frightened too, but knows to show a figure of strength when she is out and about. If she shows fear, or weakness, she worries more will cave and leave. Inside her one-bedroom apartment, which she shares with her two daughters, Jessica and Jasmine Lin, 13 and 11 respectively, Tang, who works in a fast-food establishment and emigrated to the US as a young adult amid duress, cannot suppress tears. This is her home, she says, filled with memories. It is what they have. If she and her daughters are kicked out, they will have nowhere to go, and will probably have to move across the country to be with her brother who lives in Ohio. Apart from the fact that she does not want to move from the city, she does not want to be dependent on someone else. She worries about losing her autonomy. As her daughters diligently sit on the floor doing their homework, Tang says that as Chinese Americans, it is imperative that they stand up for themselves. “If we do not fight for our rights, nobody else will.” The couple of hundred Museum Square Chinese residents are among the last Chinese residents in Washington DC’s Chinatown, Hennessy, the tenants’ rights advocate, confirms. With the last Chinese grocery store closing in 2005, and the influx of luxury developments that have attracted a much whiter, higher-income crowd, the neighborhood’s name is increasingly misleading. Yi Chen, a documentary film-maker who made a film on the slow disappearance of Chinese people and cultural elements in DC’s Chinatown, points out that Chinatowns popped up across the US after the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act as places Chinese people in the US could feel safe and create community. “The segregation of Chinatown is a direct outcome of Chinese exclusion,” confirms Min Zhou, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). “Chinatown originally formed to provide a place where Chinese immigrants find support from their country fellows in a foreign environment. During the Chinese exclusion era, the community served and later developed as a safe haven for the excluded Chinese.” The Chinese Exclusion Act marked the first time in American history that an entire ethnic group was barred from entering the country. The official Chinese labor entering the country only came to an end 60 years after the law’s first introduction with the Magnuson Act in 1943. Tang says this was the first place she came to in the US where she was really able to make friends. But when asked about how she feels about Chinatown, Tang’s oldest daughter, Jessica, who is 13, shrugs. “It is not Chinatown anymore – they have Chinese signs up but they don’t have Chinese people in the shops. It doesn’t mean anything.” Beyond caring about people’s living situation, the elephant in the room when it comes to Museum Square is what happens when the last Chinese residents of Chinatown exit. Zhou, the UCLA professor, does not mince her words. “A Chinatown without Chinese people living in it would not be called Chinatown as it loses the basis for the ethnic community,” she says. Last month, Donald Trump declared he was nominating his former Republican presidential rival Ben Carson to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, will be in charge of the annual $50bn budget of the department, which oversees the country’s affordable housing programs. In an op-ed penned in the conservative daily the Washington Times last year, Carson denounced “government-engineered attempts to legislate racial equality” in cases of housing and de facto housing segregation, making what appears to be a clear argument against government intervention, especially as it pertains to integration of minorities. In an accompanying statement, Trump referred to his own “urban renewal agenda” and his “message of economic revival, very much including our inner cities”. For many scholars and activists, the term “urban renewal” is a worrying one, carrying historically proven racial connotations. In an interview conducted in 1963 describing an oddly similar case to Watson’s, involving a young black man losing his home as his building was being destroyed to make place for a better one, the American writer James Baldwin referred to “urban renewal” as nothing more than “negro removal”. Beyond the immediate fear for her lodging, Watson keeps on going back to the fact that the threat of being removed at this moment in time feels uniquely unfair. “The city has improved a lot the past years,” Watson says. “It’s more expensive, but we want to continue being a part of it.” In her book on the subject, named the Politics of Staying Put, Gallaher points out that long-term disinvestment in cities creates the potential for lucrative re-investment further down the line, but at the expense of those who stayed put and suffered disinvestment the first time round. Watson says she has the local businesses, including the cool, new ones, on her side. “The business people, they say that too. We don’t see why you can’t be here, they tell us. You were here before us – you should stay.”','https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/03/gentrification-washington-dc-housing-topa-right-to-buy','\'Here until they take me out\': DC tenants use the law to fight gentrification',460,'us-news'),('tv-and-radio/2017/jan/03/nancy-banks-smith-on-the-archers-ambridge-is-peaceful-to-the-point-of-paralysis','‘WHO,” Lord Beaverbrook would furiously demand when his Daily Express hit yet another cow on the line, “WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THE CLATTERING TRAIN?” Everyone quickly denied being in charge of the clattering train, and the engine driver, or editor as we say, was winkled out of hiding to shed some light on the question of the cow. For months, nobody has been driving The Archers, and it shows. In September, Sean O’Connor, our exciting editor, left to sprinkle his fairy dust on EastEnders. Helen had been found not guilty of attempted murder. Ambridge was emotionally a wrung-out rag. His work here was done. Huw Kennair-Jones got the job, but did not take over as editor until this week. From now on, we should feel the imprint of his personality – whatever that may be. Brace yourself. In the meantime, it has been peaceful in Ambridge to the point of paralysis. Johnny grew a beard … Neil had a close shave … (Why did we complain that life in Ambridge was too exciting? We are suffering for it now.) Ed’s ram had a torn scrotum … Ruth called Jill a spectre at the feast, which is a bit steep even for a mother-in-law. Everyone had a really grim, low-grade, grumbly Christmas – though, admittedly, not as grim as the Fairbrother geese, the Grundy turkeys or Pip Archer’s cows. (“I expect a nice fat cheque from the abattoir.”) Toby Fairbrother, Pip Archer’s boyfriend, is, if nothing else, predictable. He can be relied on to let you down. Toby skedaddled to Brighton, and who would blame him, leaving Lynda Snell’s panto, Mother Goose, a goose short. (“Lynda is in tears!” “I wondered where she was,” said Kenton heartlessly.) The very word Brighton seems to bring Ambridge out in goosebumps. It suggests several shades of shame. Pip bristled, but I think I can set her mind at rest. Toby has recently gone into the home-brewed gin business. All he lacks is customers. I think he may have found a discriminating market in Brighton, because I happen to have a Ronald Searle cartoon of four gym-slipped St Trinian’s schoolgirls having a midnight feast.

The researchers compiled results from 1,698 studies on adult obesity, covering 186 countries, 19.2 million participants, and spanning 40 years. And they condensed it all into a single study, published earlier this year in the Lancet medical journal. And here are the full results, presented in one eye-opening graphic. The colour of each country represents its adult obesity rate in the year shown. Hover over a country to see what its obesity rate was in 1975 and what it is today. Since 1975, obesity rates have risen in every country in the world, without exception. That includes countries like the United States and the UK, where food is cheap and abundant, and countries like Somalia and Angola, where malnutrition remains an epidemic. At the low end, North Korea’s obesity rates are up about 1% (from 1.6% in 1975 to 2.8% today). Japan is also near the bottom with a 2% increase since 1975 (from 1.1% to 3.3%). The largest changes occurred in smaller Pacific island countries. Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu all saw their obesity rates increase by more than 20%, a doubling of what they were in 1975. Perhaps the country that stands out most of all is China. In 1975, only 0.5% of Chinese adults were obese. Today, China’s obesity rate is about 8%, a 16-fold increase in the most populous country in the world. Globally, the average adult today is three times as likely to be obese compared to the average adult in 1975. Few other problems exhibit such a clear trend, over such a long time frame, across the entire world. In fact, I created this map based on research and maps from NCD Risk Factor Collaboration because I think the magnitude of the global obesity epidemic is difficult to communicate with statistics alone. However, the map also illustrates another point about a completely different topic, one that is even bigger and further reaching than global obesity – the problem of information overload. The digital universe is growing exceptionally fast. Half of the information available online today was created in just the last two years. But for that information to be useful to anyone outside of subject matter experts, it must overcome a host of challenges. First, the information must be practically accessible. This obesity study represents the work of thousands of researchers over perhaps millions of hours. Data visualisation, reduces it all into an intuitive, easily-digestible graphic. At the same time, data visualisation gives us a frame of reference for understanding what would otherwise be cold, abstract numbers. When you read statistics about obesity, either as written language or as tables of numbers in a spreadsheet, you realise obesity is a problem. But when you watch the story unfold visually, you can feel the depth and magnitude of the problem because you are witnessing it firsthand. Finally, for the information to be useful, it must be discoverable from among an ever-growing sea of digital noise. Data visualisations are not only informative, they can also be fun and beautiful, something that people will want to share with their friends. As the digital universe continues to grow, making sense of all that information presents an increasingly difficult challenge. Fortunately, it may have an easy solution: communicate it visually.','https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/jan/03/using-data-visualisations-to-help-explain-the-global-obesity-explosion','How the world got fat: a visualisation of global obesity over 40 years | Max Galka',462,'global-development-professionals-network'),('public-leaders-network/2017/jan/03/public-private-partnerships-risks-jobs-trump','As US president-elect Donald Trump looks to private finance to spur $1tn in US infrastructure investment, he and his team may want to evaluate the benefits – and the challenges – of other countries’ public-private partnerships. One clear lesson is that governments need to pay close attention to contract structures to ensure private partners can be held to account. There are potential benefits for both the state and the private sector from such partnerships. In Australia, Melbourne is about to get 65 new metro trains, in a contract worth AUS $2bn. It’s the largest single order of new trains in the history of the Australian state of Victoria and the state’s first ever public-private partnership (PPP) for manufacturing. Unlike traditional contracts, under which the manufacturing location is chosen by the supplier, this partnership with the Evolution Rail consortium will ensure that 60% of manufacturing will happen locally, creating more than 1,000 desperately needed jobs. “These [trains] are about more than just carrying more people, they’re also about giving people a good wage and meaningful employment,” says Jacinta Allan, state minister for public transport. Job creation is key. Like the US, Australia has struggled with the decline in local production industries, particularly in the automotive sector. Ford closed its plant in October 2016 and Toyota and Holden will follow in 2017, leading to the loss of thousands of jobs. Not only does the new partnership specify local manufacturing, but further partnerships with Toyota and other local organisations will ensure that staff from the automotive sector are able to move into the growing rail industry. The partners in the consortium to build the new trains include local companies Downer Rail and Plenary Group, as well as China’s Changchun Railway Vehicles Company, which will set up a new regional headquarters in Melbourne. Importantly for the state of Victoria, which has conducted 28 PPP projects to date, the consortium will face financial penalties if it fails to meet its commitments to developing local content. Penalising private companies for failure to deliver on their contractual requirements is an important element of PPPs. At New York’s LaGuardia airport, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has embarked upon a $4bn PPP for the design, construction, operation and maintenance until 2050 of a new terminal building, designed to increase capacity of its existing terminal B from 8 million passengers a year to 21 million. “The challenge in doing this project is that while constructing the new terminal everything has to run as normal,” says Magnus Eriksson, vice-president for Skanska Infrastructure Development, part of the LaGuardia Gateway Partners consortia. The partnership approach has accelerated progress on the project, according to Eriksson. “There is a lot of back and forth before getting to the point where you can start construction, but in a PPP that all happens in one go so we already have the designers, the architect, and the contractors at the table,” he says. It has led to a more innovative design for the terminal. Bridges inspired by the New York skyline will take travellers to two concourse “islands”, which will enable more planes to enter and leave the terminal than in the existing U-shaped layout. The local community will also benefit from contracts worth $679m, which will be awarded to small companies that qualify as enterprises owned by those with minority backgrounds, women, disabled people or veterans. Eriksson describes it as the biggest opportunity for small and minority businesses in the city. Partnerships between public bodies and the private sector can also harness innovative new technology. One example is the recent partnership between Washington’s District Department of Transportation, Golden Triangle Business Improvement District (BID) and UK clean tech company Pavegen. In November 2016 three arrays of latest generation V3 kinetic pavers were installed on Connecticut Avenue, near the White House, where around 1,000 pedestrians an hour walk over the tiles. The system converts their footsteps into electrical power. Ensuring effective operations is one of the reasons a PPP is to be used for waste management in the Brazilian city of Curitiba, where the municipal authority acknowledged it needed to be more efficient in managing the city’s waste. At present, waste is dumped in a landfill site 30km from the city. Now, two new contracts will be created, one to collect and transport the waste and to treat it, which will probably involve building a new facility. The most innovative aspects of the new arrangement is that contractors will be paid according to their performance, rather than the amount of resources supplied; they will also be required to improve and invest in the city’s eco-citizen programme, created in 2008 to provide new opportunities for the waste pickers who make a living from landfill sites. But for public private partnerships to succeed lessons must be learned from historic PPP failures. Poorly structured deals using more expensive private finance and overly optimistic user revenue forecasts have had disastrous consequences. One example is Mexico’s PPP road programme, which left users with some of the most expensive road tolls in the world and ended with the government taking 23 projects back into public sector control, along with responsibility for $5bn of debt. It is a similar story with the South Bay Expressway in San Diego, where the private consortium filed for bankruptcy in 2010 and the highway was taken over in 2011 by the local state planning agency. More recently, Melbourne’s East West Link motorway was cancelled by the incoming Labour government in late 2014, at a cost of AUS $1.1bn, demonstrating the political sensitivities of such deals. If the US, or any other country, wants to benefit from innovative partnerships for a new privately financed infrastructure boom it must ensure that benefits are realised in the long term and users get the innovation they are paying for.

It’s not the first time the Mount Lee sign has been transformed overnight. Other examples include “Hollyweed” (again) in 1976, to mark a relaxation in the state’s marijuana laws, “Ollywood” in 1987, a comment on Oliver North and the Iran-Contra scandal, and “Oil war” in 1990 in protest at the first Gulf war. For as long as there have been landmarks, there have been people willing to deface them in the name of politics, art, fame or sheer stupidity. Duke of Wellington, Glasgow The longstanding tradition of placing a traffic cone on the head of the equestrian statue in Royal Exchange Square nearly came to an end in 2013 when the city council pledged to stop the practise. It apparently costs £10,000 to remove the cone 100 times a year. A social media campaign to “save Wellington’s cone” gathered thousands of signatures within hours. The cone remains defiant. Golden Gate bridge, San Francisco One morning in 2001, the shell of an old red VW Beetle was found dangling from the Golden Gate bridge. A group of Canadian engineering students, who had spent the night laying cable underneath the bridge, took responsibility for the intricate prank. The Little Mermaid, Copenhagen Based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairytale and more than 100 years old, the statue of the Little Mermaid has been painted, beheaded twice, blown up, and had her right arm sawn off. She has also been draped in a burqa, given a vibrator to hold, and been festooned with a sign reading “Free Pussy Riot”. The Angel of the North, Gateshead In 1998, Antony Gormley’s monumental sculpture briefly wore a giant replica of Alan Shearer’s Newcastle United shirt. It took 25 United fans, who chipped in £100 each for the shirt, to carry out the prank using fishing line, rubber balls and catapults. The shirt stayed up for 20 minutes. Winston Churchill, London During the May Day demonstrations in London in 2000, the Winston Churchill statue in Parliament Square was defaced by a former soldier who made the wartime leader look as though blood was dripping from his mouth. The statue also temporarily gained a grass mohican crafted out of a strip of turf. Jim Morrison’s grave, Paris The Doors singer, who died in Paris in 1971 from a suspected drugs overdose, is buried in Père Lachaise cemetery, where his tomb – the most visited in a cemetery where Edith Piaf, Max Ernst and Oscar Wilde are also buried – is routinely covered in graffiti, poems, flowers, candles, alcohol and underwear. It became so renowned for vandalism, with a bust of Morrison stolen in 1988, that security guards were employed to patrol the site. Trevi fountain, Rome In 2007, a man claiming to be an artist from the Italian futurist movement tipped a bucketful of dye into the 18th-century baroque monument and turned its waters a lurid red. It was dubbed “a deplorable act of vandalism, and an offence against Rome” by Anita Ekberg, the actor who famously splashed around in the fountain in La Dolce Vita.','https://www.theguardian.com/culture/shortcuts/2017/jan/03/art-of-defacing-landmarks-hollyweed-blood-red-fountain','The fine art of defacing landmarks: from ‘Hollyweed’ to Wellington’s cone',464,'culture'),('world/2017/jan/03/indias-top-court-bans-religion-and-caste-from-election-campaigns','India’s highest court has banned political candidates from seeking election on the basis of religion, caste or language, in a landmark ruling that has unclear but potentially far-reaching consequences for the way Indian politics is practised. In a split decision, the supreme court ruled on Monday that India’s constitution allowed for the free practice of faith but could “forbid interference of religions and religious beliefs with secular activity such as elections”. An election won by soliciting votes along the lines of identity politics could be considered corrupt practice and the result set aside, the court said. The dissenting judgment accused the majority justices of overreach and “judicial redrafting of the law”. The ruling casts uncertainty over five upcoming elections in states where religion and caste have traditionally helped drive voters to the polls. However, some experts expressed scepticism about whether it could be enforced. “If this judgment is taken literally, then pretty much every single party in India could be disqualified,” said Ashok Malik, a fellow at the Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation. Indian voters, especially outside big cities, have historically been organised into “vote-banks” along religious, caste and language blocs, divisions the country’s founders considered an essential component of managing power in such an intricately diverse nation. India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, belongs to a party that is explicitly Hindu in character, while other parties exist to further the interests of, among others, India’s Muslims population as well as members of socially disempowered Dalit caste. Malik said appeals to religion or caste were too deeply ingrained in Indian politics to be eradicated by a court order “Identity is intrinsic to human society and there is political mobilisation all over the world that takes place along these lines,” he said. “You can’t ban identity … A sweeping ban on the use of identity for political mobilisation is going to be unimplementable.” Malik predicted the decision might initially lead to parties bringing complaints and legal cases against another. But they would soon realise they were “locked into mutually assured destruction”, he said. “Then everyone will just ignore it.” PV Dinesh, a supreme court advocate, said the slow pace of India’s judicial system might also complicate the way the law was implemented. “If an election takes places today, and you’re questioning whether it involved corrupt practice, that whole court process will more than than six or seven years,” he said. “But elected terms, at the federal and municipal levels, are themselves only five years long.” But he foresaw that politicians would find themselves caught in the net of the new guidelines. “If the general impression of the court is that they are soliciting votes in the name of religion, definitely that will be enforceable,” he said. Monday’s decision was broadly welcomed by political leaders but members of some sectarian parties expressed reservations. “It is a welcome move but the thing is that, as a party, if I am representing a community, I will ask for votes,” said Imtiaz Jaleel, a member of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, a party representing Muslim Indians. “So, if I say development in Muslims areas, and girls need to get education, will it tantamount to breach of law? Will [saying] Muslims should be given reservation or Marathas asking for reservation be a breach?” Reservations, or affirmative-action quotas, are enshrined in India’s constitution for people from less socially powerful caste groups, but have been increasingly challenged by traditionally powerful segments of the community who argue they no longer reflect the distribution of power and wealth in India.','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/03/indias-top-court-bans-religion-and-caste-from-election-campaigns','India\'s top court bans religion and caste from election campaigns',465,'world'),('news/2017/jan/03/guardian-weekly-us-russia-turkey-syria','Cover your eyes: it really is about to happen. The day is edging ever closer when Barack Obama must make way for Donald Trump at the helm of the world’s most powerful nation. But as Obama showed last week, there is life in the outgoing president yet. The expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats in retaliation for alleged Moscow interference in the US election leaves relations between the two superpowers at their lowest ebb since the early 1980s. Yet despite the expectations of a rapid thaw once Trump takes the reins – his dogged and sustained praise of Vladimir Putin on social media continues to bewilder foreign policy analysts – Obama’s latest move leaves his successor in a tricky spot. Reverse the diplomatic expulsions and Trump could look like a Kremlin stooge; uphold them and his fledgling friendship with the Russian president could be at risk before it has begun.

And now, at last, Sir Ivan Rogers has made good on his threats, stepping down from his position as the UK’s top diplomat in Brussels. That he was due to leave in November does not soften the blow to Theresa May, nor diminish the embarrassment to her government. This year is all-important to her long-term Brexit strategy, and it has begun with an abrupt departure that she could well have done without. Consider: the PM and her ministers await the supreme court’s ruling on parliament’s right to debate article 50 – which she has repeatedly pledged will be triggered before the end of March. Before Christmas, she indicated to the Commons liaison committee that she would be setting out a framework for Britain’s departure from the EU in the first months of 2017 – presumably, though not necessarily, in a speech. Her new year message emphasised the need for national unity, as remainers and Brexiteers continue to squabble and fragment into groupuscules. Behind the scenes, No 10 officials have been engaged in heavy lifting to prepare for the official two-year negotiations with our soon-to-be former EU partners. To this end, the talented British ambassador to Brazil, Alex Ellis, takes over as director general in the Department for Exiting the European Union on 19 January. By temperament, May is a politician who likes smooth surfaces and calm deliberation. In this context, the sudden departure of Rogers is a brick thrown into the pond of her serenity. Westminster conspiracists are busily concocting elaborate theories about “Ivexit”. Some say that Rogers signed his own P45 when he told ministers last year that a new trade deal with the EU might take a decade to conclude. Others whisper that personality was more important in this case than policy: that Sir Ivan, appointed by Cameron in 2013, could not get on with the new No 10 and would never have lasted until November. The truth probably lies somewhere between the two. A diplomat so well-versed in the silken culture and mores of Brussels – and so at home there – was always going to clash with a government embroiled in the atavistic politics of Brexit. As a former home secretary, May is perfectly well-acquainted with the nuances and complexities of the EU. But she expected and required more from the UK’s permanent representative than to be reminded querulously of the obstacles to exit. As a prime minister who owes her job to a referendum that brought down her predecessor, she wanted the top diplomat in Brussels to offer solutions – and fast. That said, Sir Ivan has long been a favourite (and useful) whipping boy for senior Tories. It suited them to roll their eyes, accuse him of going native and blame the failure of this or that negotiation upon his lack of patriotic fervour. Now they won’t have Rogers to kick around. He will be replaced quickly enough, doubtless by someone billed by No 10 as a “safe pair of hands” – code for “more competent”. May will weather this particular squall. But a troubling question will linger and loom over the Brexit talks long after Sir Ivan has moved on: what if he was right?','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/03/brexit-ivan-rogers','Sir Ivan Rogers’ sudden departure is a hit to Theresa May’s Brexit plans | Matthew d’Ancona',467,'commentisfree'),('business/2017/jan/03/petrol-food-prices-uk-rising-2017','Households are being told to brace for more price rises on fuel, food and other essentials in 2017 after the new year started with petrol at a two-year high.

That has led to higher prices on forecourts, and the AA said petrol over the weekend averaged 117.90p a litre compared with 102.69p at the same time last year. The price is now the highest since December 2014. Diesel rose to 120.35p a litre compared with 105.99p a year ago. “Drivers have had a bad start to 2017, seeing 1p, 2p and even 3p ticking up on the fuel price boards over the Christmas and New Year holiday period. Petrol is back to where it was in December 2014 and diesel at a level last seen in July 2015,” a spokesman said. Households are also facing higher food costs, according to a separate report suggesting UK grocery prices rose between November and December. A basket of 35 commonly bought items cost £83.33 last month, up from £83.18 in November, according to the website mySupermarket. It was, however, still 3% cheaper than in December 2015. The increases follow signs from official data suggesting higher prices are starting to affect the way people spend. November retail sales figures showed that after fuel prices rose, annual growth in fuel sales was the slowest for almost two years. Inflation in the UK remains relatively low, at 1.2% on the latest reading, but economists say it could rise to 3% by the end of the year as the oil price increases and the pound’s weakness since the Brexit vote inflates the cost of imports to the UK such as metals and food ingredients. The import price effect is already being seen in measures of manufacturers’ costs, and companies are expected to pass at least some of that on to consumers. The British Retail Consortium said shop prices were still falling year-on-year but that the pace of deflation eased last month to 1.4% from 1.7% in November. It said the general trend for prices this year would be upwards but that competition between retailers would limit how much they could increase prices. Its latest figures show that non-food deflation decelerated to 1.9% in December, down from 2.3% in the previous month and the weakest deflation rate since June 2015. Food deflation decelerated marginally to 0.7% in December from a rate of 0.8% in November. Helen Dickinson, the BRC’s chief executive, said the majority of the categories it monitored had seen month-on-month increases even though prices were down on a year ago overall. Clothing and footwear saw month-on-month inflation for the first time in nearly two years. “We’ve said for some time that we expect to see underlying inflationary pressures, notably from the post-referendum fall in the value of the pound, feed through into shop prices,” she said. “It’s too early to confirm that this is what we’re seeing in December’s figures: timings of seasonal discounts can cause monthly fluctuations at this time of year and retailers have continued to find ways to mitigate the impact on consumers.” “However, we expect the general trend in inflation to be upwards over 2017. The magnitude of the exchange rate movement and commodity price rises combined with the increasing costs of doing business means that retailers will have little choice other than to pass on some of these rising costs into prices but the effect will be lessened by the intensity of competition.”','https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/03/petrol-food-prices-uk-rising-2017','Petrol and food prices expected to continue rising in 2017',468,'business'),('business/blog/live/2017/jan/03/markets-wait-for-uk-manufacturing-data-ftse-100-business-live','The FTSE 100 is still trading 0.6% higher at 7,188.41, up 45.52 points, leaving it on track for another record close. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones is eyeing the 20,000 level – it’s currently 0.67% ahead at 19,895.87. Crude oil prices are up more than 2% as production cuts kick in. The main economic news today was a strong UK manufacturing survey, a bigger-than-expected drop in German unemployment and a pick-up in inflation in Germany and France – all taking economists by surprise. With this, we are closing the blog for the day. Thank you for all your great comments. We’ll be back tomorrow. Inflation in Germany unexpectedly jumped to the highest level in three and a half years, official data showed today. The annual rate rose to 1.7% in December, the highest since July 2013, and compared with 0.7% the month before. The increase which comes alongside a pick-up in inflation in France and Spain provides ammunition for those at the European Central Bank who are arguing for a gradual exit from the bank’s unconventional stimulus programme. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones is up more than 150 points, or 0.8%, at 19,915.73 at the open, flirting with the 20,000 mark. The Nasdaq is more than 40 points ahead at 5,424.16 while the S&amp;P 500 is some 17 points higher at 2,255.81, both gains of nearly 0.8%. UK grocery prices rose slightly between November and December, but prices remained below 2015 due to competition among supermarkets, according to data from price tracking website mysupermarket.com. A shopping basket of 35 commonly bought items cost £83.33 in December, up from £83.18 in November. Fresh fruit and veg cost more such as bananas, grapes and carrots. But the basket was still nearly 3% cheaper than it was in December 2015, as fierce competition between supermarkets limited their ability to raise prices. Economists and retail experts expect food inflation to rise this year because the pound’s sharp fall since the Brexit vote is pushing up the cost of imported goods. The tracker covers nearly 5,000 products across Tesco, Asda, Aldi, Sainsbury’s, Ocado, Lidl and Morrisons. Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Importantly, the delay means that the Trump administration, which has in the past suggested it wants to relax banking regulation, will now be involved in signing off the new proposals. The proposals are already contentious, but whether they will be weakened remains to be seen. Meanwhile, the retail sector has an early dose of the January blues, he noted, with Next, Dixons Carphone and Marks &amp; Spencer the biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 today. Halfords is still the biggest loser in the FTSE 350 index. Those with substantial import costs have been hit particularly hard, after Deutsche Bank flagged the potential for lower sterling to lead to higher inflation in a research note released this morning. With the note highlighting the difficulties a weak pound could bring to Halfords’ already increasing cost base, shares in the UK’s leading retailer of motoring and cycling products fell by 5.6%. Our City editor Jill Treanor writes: Global regulators have postponed a meeting to agree major reforms to the banking sector prompted by the 2008 crisis. A leading group of central bankers was due to meet on 8 January to agree changes that could have forced some banks - largely in Europe - to hold more capital. But it was announced on Tuesday that the meeting had been called off. No new date was given for the meeting of central bankers - known as the group of central bank governors and heads of supervision (GHOS) - who were due to discuss rules that influence how much capital banks hold and the way they measure the risks they are taking. Banks are the biggest risers on the FTSE 100, led by Barclays which is up 4%, after global regulators delayed the sign off of new rules on bank capitalisation. Lloyds Banking Group is 3.6% ahead while Royal Bank of Scotland has risen 3.3%, Standard Chartered 2.4% and HSBC is up 2%. Mining shares, which have been among the big winners of the weak pound in the past year, are also among the biggest gainers, including Antofagasta and Glencore. Oil prices have been rising as new production cuts take effect, as reported earlier. This is feeding through to petrol prices. UK drivers are paying 15p a litre – or £8.25 a tank – more for their fuel than a year ago, according to the AA. Petrol over the weekend averaged 117.90p a litre compared to 102.69p at the same time last year, a price last seen in December 2014. Diesel has risen to 120.35p from 105.99p 12 months ago. AA spokesman Luke Bosdet said: Drivers have had a bad start to 2017, seeing 1p, 2p and even 3p ticking up on the fuel price boards over the Christmas and New Year holiday period. Petrol is back to where it was in December 2014 and diesel at a level last seen in July 2015. All in all, with the cold weather, it’s been a pretty miserable return to work. UK workers’ confidence has not been shaken by uncertainty around leaving the European Union, with 48% saying that they are looking for a new job this year, according to specialist recruiter Reed. It asked more than 2,000 people about their careers in 2017, and found that 43% are feeling optimistic about their career prospects. The FTSE 100 has hit fresh all-time highs on the first trading day of the year in London, building on its record close at the end of 2016. It rose through the 7,200 mark earlier to a new record of 7,205.21 and is now more than 30 points ahead at 7,176.20, a 0.5% gain. The leading index is on track for another record close if it holds on to its gains. Retailers are among the biggest fallers, led by Next, which was downgraded by Deutsche Bank ahead of a Christmas trading update tomorrow. Dixons Carphone, Marks &amp; Spencer and Kingfisher are also down. European bourses are also ahead. Germany’s Dax up 0.04% at 11,602.96 France’s CAC up 0.5% at 4,906.27 Spain’s Ibex up 0.4% at 9,460.40 Italy’s FTSE MiB up 0.7% at 19,703.28 Britain’s factories are booming, according to the latest manufacturing PMI survey from Markit/CIPS. This drove the pound to a two-week high against the euro. Oil prices reached 18-month highs this morning as production cuts kick in. Brent crude touched $58.37 a barrel earlier and is now up 2.1% at $58.02. As speculation continues over where banks based in London and elsewhere in the UK might choose to settle after Brexit, we hear today from the boss of American bank JP Morgan. Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief executive of JP Morgan, has been speaking about his hopes for the investment bank’s UK operations once Brexit becomes a reality to Financial News. Dimon said he worries Brexit will have repercussions for the rest of the European Union. “A major fear to me about Brexit is that it causes the EU to fail down the road,” he told Financial News in the interview at JP Morgan’s Victoria Embankment offices in London. Financial News says Dimon also proclaimed a “love” for London, but provided no reassurance that JP Morgan wouldn’t move business from the City to the continent after Brexit takes effect. “I wish we could keep it all here [in London],” said Dimon. “I think it’s very good for Europe.” The full interview is available here. Ahead of the June referendum, JP Morgan was among the big banks warning that a vote to leave would cost jobs. It said 4,000 jobs could go. The FTSE 100 has not managed to hold on to all its earlier gains, when it pushed through the 7,200 mark, but still looks on track for another record close. The index of London-listed bluechips is currently up 31 points at 7,174, having closed at an all-time high of 7,142.83 on Friday, the last trading day of 2016. The futures market is also pointing to a strong start to 2017 for Wall Street. Much of the support for the FTSE has come from the weak pound, which is down sharply since last June’s Brexit vote. The weak pound flatters the earnings of those FTSE 100 companies that report in dollars. It has also helped those firms who export from Britain and it makes assets priced in pounds more attractive to foreign investors. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at spread betting firm Spreadex expects the FTSE 100 to remain in positive territory in afternoon trading but said the pound’s strength was limiting gains. He also expects gains on Wall Street for the Dow Jones industrial average index. Campbell commented: It appears that this morning’s December manufacturing PMI reading... hampered the FTSE’s record-breaking surge by giving a boost to the pound. In the aftermath of the PMI release sterling jumped 0.6% against the euro, taking it back above 1.18 for the first time in a week and a half; this was enough to temper the FTSE’s growth, despite the fact that the pound is continuing to struggle against the dollar... Looking ahead to this afternoon and following a bitterly disappointing end to 2016 that saw the index fail to break 20,000 the Dow Jones is set to recover some of its losses this Tuesday. The Dow futures are suggesting the index will reclaim around 150 points, pushing it above 19900 and putting that elusive landmark level back on the cards. The upbeat PMI report on the UK’s manufacturing industry caught City analysts off guard. But they have been quick to point out the divergence between the PMI survey and official data which paints a gloomier picture of the factory sector and many also highlight the threat that higher inflation in 2017 will squeeze consumer spending, the biggest driver of economic growth in the UK. The outlook remains one of a marked slowdown for the UK economy this year, says James Knightley, senior economist at the bank ING. He commented: This [the PMI reading] is the strongest figure since June 2014 and again suggests that the Brexit referendum has not harmed the UK’s manufacturing sector. In fact, the 18% post referendum plunge in the value of the pound against other major currencies has boosted the UK’s competitiveness on the international stage. This is being seen in the new orders component with export orders performing well. However, sterling’s fall also means that imported components are more expensive with both costs and output prices rising yet again. This increase in domestic pipeline inflation pressures is being mirrored by higher costs for imported consumer goods and energy. As such, the squeeze on household spending power is set to intensify. So while the strength of the manufacturing sector is good news, the likely weakness in the much larger consumer sector will more than offset it. Therefore we expect GDP growth to slow to a little above 1% in 2017 from 2.2% in 2016. A new network to link up Irish and British trading partners has been formed to offset any negative Brexit impact on trade between the UK and Ireland, reports Henry McDonald, our Ireland correspondent. The British Irish Chamber of Commerce has launched the ‘British Irish Gateway to Trade’ service, which link up firms from both sides of the Irish Sea. Britain remains Ireland’s biggest trading partner with business between the UK and the Republic supporting 400,000 jobs according to the British Irish Chamber of Commerce. Its chairman John McGrane said the network would promote more growth in trade between Ireland and the UK in the face of the Brexit challenge. McGrane said: At a time when businesses are preparing for Brexit, they appreciate a resource like BIG which helps them to grow their business by being introduced to more customers and suppliers across the UK and Ireland”. 2017 will focus all our minds on the importance of the trade between Britain and Ireland which supports over 400,000 jobs. Firms on both sides of the Irish Sea are looking for more trading opportunities and this new service supports the work of Chambers and the various state agencies to make those connections easier to find for businesses north south east and west. The new service lets businesses find the trading partners they want within a trusted network of like-minded firms across the two islands. The full story: More reaction to the strong UK manufacturing PMI. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, doesn’t believe it will last. UK manufacturing is benefiting from both continued brisk growth in domestic demand as well as improving global demand, but this momentum likely will peter out in 2017. The pick-up in the total orders balance to 58.5 from 55.2 suggests manufacturing output will continue to grow briskly over the next couple of months. Meanwhile, the fact that the UK’s PMI exceeds those for the eurozone and U.S., 54.9 and 54.2 respectively, signals that the UK economy is continuing to marginally outperform. The relationship between the PMI and the official data, however, has been particularly loose lately; the PMI has signalled steady growth in manufacturing output since August, but the official data have oscillated around a flat trend. Meanwhile, we continue to think that domestic demand for manufactured goods will crumble as consumers experience a renewed squeeze on their real incomes, driven mainly by higher import prices. At the same time, the boost to growth from sterling’s depreciation will remain relatively modest, because exporters have raised sterling prices sharply and because uncertainty about the UK’s future trade relationships will deter exporters from investing. Oil prices have pushed even higher, to 18-month highs, boosted by hopes that a deal to cut production between Opec and non-Opec producers such as Russia will diminish the global oil glut. Brent crude jumped about 2.5% to $58.37 a barrel, the highest since July 2015. Ruth Gregory, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: December’s UK Markit/CIPS manufacturing PMI provides further evidence that the sector’s post-referendum weakness will prove short-lived... A rise in overall new orders to a two-and-a-half year high suggests that the strength in manufacturing activity will continue in the coming months. Admittedly, the fall in the pound is having a clear impact on price pressures. Indeed, despite falling back from 79.1 in November to 76.9 in December, the input prices balance remained well above its long-run average (55.1). Nonetheless, on the basis of past form, the three-month average of the survey’s output balance is consistent with a quarterly rise in manufacturing output of about 1% in Q4, following Q3’s 0.8% contraction. This is consistent with other survey evidence, such as the CBI’s Industrial Trends Survey, which suggest that the manufacturing sector gained some momentum at the end of 2016 too. That said, given the sharp monthly fall in October in the official figures, even a large increase in output in November and December would probably not be enough to lead to a positive contribution to GDP growth in Q4. A stronger end to the quarter would, however, provide a good base for manufacturing growth in Q1. As such, we continue to think that GDP growth will become better balanced in the quarters ahead. Sterling jumped to a two-week high against the euro after the strong manufacturing survey. It hit 84.71p per euro, up 0.5%. Against the dollar, the pound rose to $1.2290. The FTSE 100 index, which was up 0.8% earlier this morning, is only 0.4% ahead now at 7173.12, a gain of some 30 points. All the main sub-indices were strong. New export business rose for the seventh month in December. Companies secured new orders from the US, Europe, China, the Middle East, India and other Asian markets. Employment rose for the fifth month in December, with the pace of jobs growth picking up to the fastest in 14 months, especially at smaller and medium-sized firms. Rates of inflation for input costs and prices charged both remained among the fastest seen during the survey’s history, but slowed from October’s highs. UK factories ended 2016 on a strong note, according to the Markit/CIPS manufacturing survey. The December reading of 56.1, a 30-month high, is up from 53.6 in November and well above its long-run average of 51.5. Rising domestic and overseas demand has boosted output and companies’ order books. Price pressures remained elevated but eased from recent highs. The UK manufacturing PMI has hit the highest level since June 2014, rising to 56.1 – better than expected. Oil prices are pushing higher this morning, helping underpin gains in the FTSE 100. Brent crude is up 82 cents, or 1.4%, at $57.64, not far below the 2016 high of $57.89, hit on 12 December. US light crude is trading 72 cents higher at $54.44, a 1.3% gain. 1 January marked the official start of a recently agreed deal between the oil cartel Opec and other exporters such as Russia to reduce output by almost 1.8m barrels a day. Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN Amro in Amsterdam, told Reuters: First signals suggest the Opec and non-Opec production cuts are raising hops that the global oil oversupply will diminish. The number of unemployed people in Germany has fallen for a third month in a row, declining by a seasonally adjusted 17,000 in December from the previous month to 2.638 million. Economists had expected a drop of 5,000. Germany’s Federal Statistics Office also said that the jobless rate was unchanged at 6%, the lowest since German reunification in 1990. 2016 was a good year for vinyl, when sales reached a 25-year high, as LPs continue their comeback. Hannah Ellis-Petersen writes: More than 3.2m LPs were sold last year, a rise of 53% on last year and the highest number since 1991 when Simply Red’s Stars was the bestselling album. This was also the first year that spending on vinyl outstripped that spent on digital downloads. The deaths of some music world giants was a key driver in vinyl sales, as people invested in records as a mementos. After David Bowie’s death he became the bestselling vinyl artist of 2016, with five albums posthumously featuring in the top 30. We have published our share tips for 2017, including Tesco, Diageo, Dairy Crest, Flybe and Shire. Last year our tips didn’t do so well, alas. Looking back at 2016, our markets reporter Nick Fletcher writes: It’s a cliche – and true enough – that stock markets hate uncertainty, which is one possible explanation for why investors shrugged off the shock of Brexit and the even bigger shock of a Donald Trump presidency. At least there was an element of knowing where we stood, in the near term at least. In a volatile 12 months, the FTSE 100 slumped to three-and-a-half-year lows in February on fears of a global economic slowdown, recovered, then fell sharply but briefly following the EU referendum vote, before hitting new heights as a drop in the pound boosted the index’s overseas earners and a rise in oil prices lifted commodity companies. It finally ended the year at a record 7,142, up 14.4%. The manufacturing PMI for Japan has come in weak, suggesting factory activity is shrinking at a faster rate. Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, has sent us his thoughts. Continuing the push it saw at the very end of 2016 the UK index is already eyeing the 7200 mark, a 50 point-plus rise leaving it within striking distance of that landmark level. For now, at least, investors are ignoring the potentially disruptive events littered across 2017 – most pertinent to the FTSE being March’s triggering of Article 50 and the impending announcements related to the banking sector’s decision whether or not to stay in the UK post-Brexit – to get behind the UK index. Helping the FTSE is the performance of Brent crude which, at just above $57 per barrel, is at its best price in around 18 months, something that has secured some solid growth in the commodity sector as the New Year gets underway. The FTSE does, however, get its first 2017-test this morning in the form of December’s manufacturing PMI; analysts are expecting the figure to dip slightly month-on-month, from 53.4 to 53.3. Any negative news will likely be absorbed by the pound, which is sitting flat just above a 2-month, sub $1.23 low against the dollar. Shares in London continue to climb on the first trading day of the year, pushing the FTSE 100 up briefly to 7,202.44, a fresh record high. It is now 0.8% ahead, not far below the 7,200 mark. Mining stocks Glencore and Anglo American, which have benefited hugely from the weak pound in the past year, are among the biggest risers today, as is Intercontinental Hotels, after a rating upgrade from Barclays. Retailer Next is the biggest faller, down 3.2%, after Deutsche Bank downgraded its rating on the stock to “hold” from “buy”. European equity markets are also up for a second day. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index has risen 0.75% to 365.89, the highest level since December 2015. Italian banks are among the top gainers, with the newly-merged Banco BPM gaining 4.6% in early trading. Economists at Daiwa said: With Spanish inflation on the EU harmonised measure released last Friday surprising notably on the upside, rising 0.9ppt to 1.4% year-on-year, a near-3½-year high, the equivalent flash euro area figure due tomorrow is expected to rise 0.4ppt to 1.0%Y/Y, which would be the highest in since September 2013. Nevertheless, given the continued lack of underlying cost pressures, euro area core CPI is expected to be unchanged at just 0.8%Y/Y, for the fifth consecutive month. In the eurozone, the focus today is on the flash estimates of December inflation figures from Germany and France as well as German unemployment data. The French numbers are already out – inflation rose at an annual rate of 0.8% last month, the highest since May 2014, driven by higher food and energy prices while services inflation slipped back. The German data are expected to show an annual inflation rate of 1.3%, which would be the strongest since 2013. We are also getting German unemployment data this morning. Economists are forecasting a small fall of 5,000 in the number of jobless people, leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at 6%. European stock markets have also opened higher. The Dax in Frankfurt and the Ibex in Madrid are both 0.3% ahead while the CAC in Paris and the FTSE MiB in Milan have gained 0.5%. The FTSE 100 has hit a new record high at the open, rising more than 27 points to 7170.65, a 0.4% rise. On the corporate front, the London Stock Exchange is selling its 50% stake in the French clearing arm of LCH Clearnet to Euronext, which runs several European exchanges, in a €510m (£433m) deal. Both companies have agreed on the terms of Euronext’s all-cash offer. The LSE is offloading its stake in LCH in an attempt to ward off anti-trust concerns raised by the European commission over its proposed £21bn mega-merger with Deutsche Börse, the operator of the German stock exchange. Read the full story here. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, believes that slowing growth in real incomes (adjusted for inflation) will define the UK economy this year. He says that income growth is unlikely to keep up with rising inflation, caused by the sharp slide in the pound which is pushing up the price of imported raw materials and other goods. The UK economy retained its momentum last year, despite the seismic shock of the vote to leave the EU. Quarter-on-quarter GDP growth averaged 0.5% in the first three quarters of 2016, matching 2015’s rate and the average pace of growth across the Atlantic. So far, surveys and official data point to growth of about 0.4% in Q4. The economy’s strength, however, has relied on consumers, who will not be able to raise spending much further in 2017 as the consequences of the Brexit vote unfold... The jobs data already have begun to lose their shine; employment fell by 6K in the three months to October, the first decline since mid-2015. The numbers often are erratic, but the deterioration in surveys of employment intentions and a small decline in the number of vacancies points to a clear slowdown in job growth. In addition, we expect no serious increase in wage growth, which likely will remain close to 2.5% this year. Employers are responding to rising materials costs by squeezing pay; the median basic pay deal was just 1.6% in the three months to November, down from 2% in the first half of the year, according to XpertHR... Households’ real incomes look set to stagnate this year, following increases of 3.6% in 2015 and 2% in 2016. Investec economist Chris Hare is expecting a slight uptick in the UK factory index today, to a healthy 53.6. It dropped unexpectedly in November to 53.4 from October’s revised 54.2, the second monthly decline. Anything above 50 indicates expansion while a reading below points to contraction. He says: The decline on the month is no cause for panic though – the index still remains above levels that prevailed in the months before the UK’s vote to leave the EU and is also still above its long run average level. Indeed, we expect the read from the manufacturing sector to remain fairly elevated over the coming months – exporters should continue to benefit from post-referendum falls in the pound. Over time, that should more than offset the adverse effect of higher import costs. Meanwhile, we would note that businesses have largely shrugged off the economic uncertainty associated with the post-Brexit vote environment. Good morning, and Happy New Year. Welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The FTSE 100 ended 2016 at a record high of 7,142.83 after a surge in mining stocks and dollar earners, which dominate the index. The pound has lost 17% against the dollar since the Brexit vote in June, benefiting those companies that make most of their money overseas. The UK market reopens today after yesterday’s bank holiday closure – the first trading day of 2017. The highlight is the UK manufacturing purchasing managers’ index for December, which will shed more light on how industry has fared since the referendum. European stock markets got off to a good start yesterday after strong manufacturing reports. The manufacturing PMI for the eurozone rose to 54.9 last month, the highest since April 2011, boosted by Germany, France and Italy. German factory growth rose to close to a three-year high thanks to rising demand from Asia and the US. French manufacturing hit a five-and-a-half-year high, while in Italy factories grew at their fastest rate since June.','https://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/live/2017/jan/03/markets-wait-for-uk-manufacturing-data-ftse-100-business-live','UK manufacturing PMI rises to two-year high as FTSE 100 hits fresh record – as it happened',469,'business'),('books/booksblog/2017/jan/03/reading-group-the-blue-flower-by-penelope-fitzgerald-is-januarys-choice','Following our vote last week, Penelope Fitzgerald’s The Blue Flower has emerged as this month’s reading group choice – just. It’s been a painfully close-run thing, with The Beginning of Spring right behind and The Bookshop close after that. “I love them all,” was a fairly typical comment. Choosing between these fine novels has clearly proved a challenge. Since nearly all Fitzgerald’s books seem to be universally admired, I hope I’m right in assuming that those disappointed their first choice didn’t win will still enjoy The Blue Flower. It certainly sounds like an intriguing novel. For a start, it has been showered with praise. Fitzgerald biographer Hermione Lee has called The Blue Flower her subject’s “beautiful masterpiece”. Frank Kermode wrote in a 2010 introduction to the book that it is “the finest work of this extraordinarily gifted novelist”. Novelist Andrew Miller says it is “impeccable” and when the book came out in 1995 poet and translator Michael Hoffman wrote in the New York Times that it is “hard to know where to begin to praise the book” before also declaring it a masterpiece. This is also a novel with a fascinating, if difficult, subject: the early German Romantic philosopher Novalis and his love for a teenage girl. We’ll be able to say more about what to make of that as we read through the book. I have a feeling there’s going to be a great deal to discuss in The Blue Flower, but let’s keep our options open and consider touching on The Beginning of Spring later on in the month. As ever, I’ll be keen to hear opinions about that and any other subjects you’d like to discuss. To further that end, we have five copies of The Blue Flower to give away to the first five readers from the UK to post “I want a copy please”, along with a nice, constructive comment in the comments section below. If you’re lucky enough to be one of the first to comment, email Laura Kemp with your address (laura.kemp@theguardian.com). Be nice to her, too. On 27 January, we’ll also be joined by the wonderful Hermione Lee for a webchat about Fitzgerald. Lee wrote Penelope Fitzgerald: A Life in 2013; “a perfect choice as Fitzgerald’s biographer” according to Philip Hensher, who credited Lee in his review for doing “a superb job, capturing an elusive personality and a complex, sometimes rather harrowing story”. Oh, and one final word of caution: Fitzgerald often said she didn’t like to explain too much about her books for fear of insulting her readers … but since we’ve just spent a month breaking the first two rules of Fight Club, I’m hoping we can grant ourselves a certain amount of leeway.','https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/jan/03/reading-group-the-blue-flower-by-penelope-fitzgerald-is-januarys-choice','Reading group: The Blue Flower by Penelope Fitzgerald is January\'s choice',470,'books'),('sport/2017/jan/03/bengals-cornerback-adam-jones-arrest','The Bengals cornerback Adam Jones has been charged with assault following an incident in a hotel in downtown Cincinnati early on Tuesday morning. Police say Jones refused to comply with law enforcement following his arrest, and tried to headbutt an officer. He then allegedly spat at a nurse at the county jail. Records show the 33-year-old was charged with assault, disorderly conduct, obstructing official business and harassment with a bodily substance. The latter represents a felony charge; the other three charges are misdemeanors. Jones was booked at 12.25am local time and was arraigned on Tuesday morning. Jones, via his attorney during the arraignment, said he “vehemently denies” the accusations. A judge sent Jones’s bond at $37,500. The Bengals said in a statement: “We are aware of and are working to gather full information, but policy is that it’s inappropriate for the club to comment on unresolved legal matters.” Local news reports said Jones was seen beating on a hotel room door while screaming and swearing, and “pushing and poking” a man in the eye. Police arrived and arrested him. Jones allegedly refused to enter the police car and pulled away before kicking and headbutting an officer. Police said he then spat on the hand of a nurse while he was being booked into the Hamilton County justice center. Jones has had a string of legal troubles over his career. In 2011, he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of disorderly conduct after an incident in a bar. In 2013, he was charged with assault outside another bar in Cincinnati, but was found not guilty. He was the sixth overall draft pick in 2005 but found life difficult with the Tennessee Titans. He missed the 2007 season through suspension and sat out the 2009 season when no team was interested in him. He joined the Bengals in 2010.','https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/03/bengals-cornerback-adam-jones-arrest','Bengals\' Adam Jones charged with assault after incident in Cincinnati hotel',471,'sport'),('football/blog/2017/jan/03/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-liverpool-jurgen-klopp-christmas-fixtures','The FA Cup arrives like the cavalry at the weekend to interrupt an engrossing title race and temporarily shelve Pep Guardiola’s rhetorical question about whether or not Manchester City are in it. To judge by their last couple of games City cannot be certain of a Champions League place at the end of the season, let alone first place, and this realisation appears to have dawned on their manager during his televised press conferences. Tetchy Pep has been a diverting sideshow over the past few weeks but in his post-match interview with the BBC after the new year bank holiday fixture against Burnley the manager’s dissatisfaction with just about everything English was plain to see. English referees keep sending off his players, then English reporters will make the situation worse by asking if City have a discipline problem. English opponents make life difficult for his goalkeeper at corners in a way that would not be allowed anywhere else in the world. English teams play too many games in too short a time around the turn of the year and, Guardiola only mentions this two or three times a week, the English system somehow allows Chelsea and Liverpool to fight for the title even though they do not have to play in Europe. All things considered, Guardiola is not a happy man at the moment. Neither is Jürgen Klopp, whose efforts to catch Chelsea were hindered when his side could manage only a draw at Sunderland, though at least the Liverpool manager mostly railed against the stupidity of a fixture programme that sent his players to the north-east less than 48 hours after their previous game. Liverpool came unstuck by conceding two penalties and when he calms down Klopp will accept that and move on. Guardiola, on the other hand, appears to be getting stuck on the idea that everything in England is set up so that a gleeful public can rejoice in his failure. City actually passed the Stoke City test with flying colours in August, coming away from the Bet365 Stadium with an impressive 4-1 win, although in Guardiola’s mind at least all those predictions that his aesthetic style would not be sufficiently robust for the English game are now playing out as self-fulfilling prophesies. He has a point about the absurdity of the festive fixtures but so does every other manager. It is the new arrivals in the country who find the English habit of building a crisis into a constitution so difficult to understand, and particular sympathy should go to Claude Puel and Southampton, who ended up with three games in six days. Klopp’s breezy pre-Christmas confidence, when he said the festive programme was silly but at least it was the same for everybody, did not survive a couple of setbacks at Sunderland and was based on a false premise anyway. All too clearly the festive programme was not the same for everyone. Southampton had to play three times in six days, Liverpool three times in seven days, while the burden on Chelsea is a relatively normal three games in 10 days, all without leaving London. If English football insists on doing Christmas and new year differently to everyone else, if it imagines a steeplechase-type spectacle is somehow character building at the halfway point of the season, it really should do more to make certain the demands made on each team are as equal as possible. At the moment, particularly with games involving leading sides being switched for television, the festive programme is too much of a lottery. You can understand coaches from other leagues failing to appreciate the novelty – and apparently next season’s festive list is even more demanding. Based on his performance on the BBC, it is not too early to begin wondering if Guardiola will still be here by then. The particular novelty he is failing to appreciate at the moment is being up to 10 points off the pace, as he was when City lost at Anfield after Chelsea had won earlier in the day. He has limited experience of that sort of situation – and it is beginning to show. He is not enjoying England and that is beginning to show, too. Just as City would not have expected to be so far behind Chelsea at this stage, with seven red cards, key players continually being suspended and a manager unable or unwilling to discuss disciplinary matters, so Guardiola must be trying to work out how he can turn around such a difficult position. At Barcelona and Bayern Munich, dominant teams in their leagues, his players always appeared to do exactly what their coach wanted. At least that was the impression from outside and one can only assume that was what City thought they were buying into. Yet City’s players seem in some way resistant to Guardiola’s ideas and influence. This group of players do their own thing, often to the evident frustration of the manager on the sidelines. Against Chelsea, City had been out of control, their inability to stay with the leaders spilling over into petulant spite once the match had been won. At Liverpool they were too passive and ineffective, against Burnley at home Fernandinho at least was so fired-up he was dismissed before half-time. What could Guardiola say to explain such inconsistency? No wonder he chose to concentrate on an alleged foul on Claudio Bravo in the buildup to Burnley’s goal. “I’ve seen it back, it’s just a goal,” his opposite number, Sean Dyche, said. Guardiola will continue to disagree, although had he been in a position to watch Jeff Stelling and co on Sky as the goal was scored he might have found it a useful aid to his English education. No one in the studio mentioned a foul on the goalkeeper. The opinion instead was Bravo had not dealt with the cross very well. There are no special rules in England, as Guardiola rather ludicrously suggested. But (who knew?) there are a lot of crosses.','https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/jan/03/pep-guardiola-manchester-city-liverpool-jurgen-klopp-christmas-fixtures','Pep Guardiola’s winter of discontent is nothing new in Premier League circus | Paul Wilson',472,'football'),('music/2017/jan/03/girl-rock-camp-music-industry-sexism','Girls Rock graduate and bassist Ivy Dement is teaching her bandmates how to breakdance in the corridors of the prestigious Berklee College of Music in Boston. “I am going to come here every year until I die,” says the 15-year-old intern in a deadpan voice. “Without this I don’t think I’d be who I am. I’m a punk rock cheerleader.” Dement is among many graduates of Girls Rock Campaign Boston – just one strand of a burgeoning movement. “You can just be whoever you want here,” says Annie Tremblay, 16, who is piggy-backing her sister Lucie. “Plus you don’t have to shave your legs!” replies guitarist Sid Hammond, 17. The all-girls rock camp is now in its 16th year, having originated in the Pacific Northwest of the US; home of riot grrrl, grunge and all things right-on. The first camp took place in Portland, Oregon, in 2001, and there are now 44 branches in the US, with artists such as Tegan and Sara, Kathleen Hanna and Beth Ditto on the advisory board of the Girls Rock Foundation, which raises funds for the camps. It is now also a global phenomenon. There are camps everywhere from Lima to Brisbane to Tokyo; London hosted its first camp in 2016 and this year will see several new offshoots in the UK and Ireland. The Girls Rock Alliance, the global umbrella organisation that unites camp leaders, says the ethos is simple: all camps believe that gender and culture should not dictate whether a person can play music. The camps can vary but their principles and format are the same: girls aged eight to 18 learn an instrument, form a band, write an original song and perform it at a live music venue. They usually take place over a week during the summer holidays, though many cities now offer after-school programmes all year round. As well as music lessons, there are also workshops, ranging from lyric writing to learning solder pedals and instrument maintenance to silk-screening band T-shirts and magazine making. The schools aim to be inclusive regarding race, disability and socio-economic background. There are varying fees but but nearly all camps include free or subsidised places for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Boston camp founders Nora Allen-Wiles and Hilken Mancini met while volunteering at the Portland camp in 2007, before setting up their own in 2010. “At our first session we only had space for 40 kids and there was such a long waiting list that in 2011 we tripled our capacity and expanded to two sessions with 60 girls each,” says Mancini. The movement has grown largely through word of mouth, with many camps having been established by people who joined the organisation as volunteers. Karla Schickele, co-founder of the Willie-Mae Rock Camp for Girls, the movement’s New York branch, says she first heard about the original camp on the radio and felt an overwhelming compulsion to visit. “I had a day job at the time and used all my vacation to fly across the country to be part of it because it just sounded awesome. Like many people, you go and see this incredible week and think, ‘Hey, we absolutely need one of these’.” Allen-Wiles thinks raising girls’ confidence is a big reason the camps have been so successful. “I think the popularity is growing because disguising a self-esteem camp as a rock’n’roll camp is genius. Telling a group of girls that they should be confident can feel like an abstract concept, but giving a girl an electric guitar and telling her to turn it up as loud she wants sends a message.” Geraldine Smith, one of the founders of the London branch, which had its first successful camp in August, agrees. “I think it is a very positive and creative response to sexism in the music industry. It draws in people who maybe wouldn’t get involved in direct political campaigning.” London co-founder and drummer Vicky O’Neon helped set up a camp in her native Finland, and wishes similar opportunities had been around when she was growing up. “When I started out I didn’t feel very confident in a male industry,” she says. “Most female musicians have felt this way. I think if we can in some way help the next generation not to feel that, that’s amazing.” O’Neon believes the internet is helping the movement catch on in the UK. “We Skype with people in America and Europe to talk about things that come up. I’ve never found a platform like this before, where it feels like I have friends I haven’t met,” she says. Smith adds: “The internet now means people can give each other their expertise for free. It is quite a moving thing.” “It is about so much more than music. There is something overwhelming about being in this space, seeing women being so wonderful to each other. It sends a powerful message to young girls.” Rossella Bottone visited the London camp as a volunteer this summer and is co-founding a camp in Dublin to be held in July. “I know first-hand the challenges facing girls in our industry,” she says. “Earlier this year I quit the corporate job I’d had for nine years and decided do something meaningful. Launching Girls Rock Dublin seemed the obvious thing to do.” Now established in London, Glasgow and Dublin, Smith says there are also plans underway for Sunderland, Bristol and Edinburgh. “It has exploded. I think at the last conference there were 200 organisers there from all over the world,” says Schickele. With the Boston camp in its sixth year, Allen-Wiles says the eagerness of former campers to return as volunteers shows that the camps are doing their job building confidence in the next generation. The camp’s two co-founders couldn’t be held in higher esteem among the young rockers. “I want to be like Hilken when I’m older,” says 17-year-old Sid Hammond. “I want them to pass the camp on to me.” Liana Glennan, also 17, adds: “I’m gonna be Nora. If I am just Nora then I’ll die happy.” “It blows me away that there are youth who believe so strongly in the mission of this organisation and have been involved for so long”, says Allen-Wiles. “To see them move into a leadership role was really exciting. They are the future of this world – and it is bright.”','https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/03/girl-rock-camp-music-industry-sexism','Girls Rock: the all-female music camp taking a stand against sexism',473,'music'),('world/2017/jan/03/far-right-israel-minister-naftali-bennett-bill-annex-maale-adumim-settlement-palestinian-territories','The far-right Israeli education minister, Naftali Bennett, has vowed to introduce a bill this month to formally annex Maale Adumim, one of Israel’s largest settlement blocks in the occupied Palestinian territories. In remarks made at a museum in the city of 40,000 located outside Jerusalem, Bennett said: “After being here for 50 years, the time has come to end military rule.” The hardline leader of the Jewish Home party also made clear that he saw the annexation of Maale Adumim as a first step in annexing all of “area C”, the part of the occupied territories still under full Israeli control. “For this reason,” said Bennett, “by the end of the month, we will submit the bill for applying [Israeli] law to Judea and Samaria [the name used by Israelis for the occupied territories] and will embark on a new path. We will present to the cabinet a bill for applying Israeli law in Maale Adumim.” The timing of Bennett’s announcement, and of his plan to introduce the legislation in the first place, appears to have been designed to exploit the inauguration of Donald Trump on 20 January. The US president-elect has indicated he will be more supportive of Israel in international arenas that regard the settlements as illegal. Bennett’s call also comes soon after the adoption by the UN security council of a resolution reiterating that Jewish settlements on land intended for a future Palestinian state represent a “flagrant violation” of international law and an obstacle to a two-state solution. Bennett, who has long set out his political stall as a nationalist, settlement-supporting and pro-annexation opponent of such a two-state solution, told supporters he saw Trump’s inauguration as a “small window of opportunity” to annex Area C, starting with Maale Adumim. His view is opposed by both allies of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the leader of the opposition, Isaac Herzog, who warned at the weekend that supporting annexation was “brainwashing the public with lies, such as claiming that we can annex Area C and the world will allow it”. Netanyahu has instructed the ministers in his coalition not to talk about annexation. The prime minister, whose support in the polls has been slipping, was interviewed on Monday by police as part of their investigation into whether he broke the law by receiving gifts from wealthy businessmen. He denies any wrongdoing, and has decried “years of daily persecution against me and my family”. Amid Netanyahu’s political and legal problems, Bennett appears to have become increasingly emboldened, seeking in recent weeks to capitalise on indications that a Trump presidency may align more closely with his political viewpoint. It began with a speech to the Saban forum in Washington in December and continued with an interview in the rightwing, English-language Jerusalem Post on Monday in which Bennett again made clear his opposition to a Palestinian state. “I do not believe in a second Palestinian state beyond what we have in Gaza,” Bennett told the paper, saying that instead he proposed a staged end of Israeli military rule in Area C while offering full Israeli citizenship to the 80,000 Palestinians living there. For their part Jewish settlements in the West Bank would be incorporated into Israel while the remaining areas under Palestinian administration – known as Areas A and B – would be given a degree of autonomy short of statehood. “This would be less than a state, but [it would still be] a lot,” he said. “They would have a central government with elections, if they so choose.” In a question and answer session with the Washington Post on Monday Bennett denied that his plan violated international law, despite the clear view of UN security council resolutions over the years as well as widespread international consensus on the issue. “It does not violate international law because that would suggest that we occupy a state,” he said. “We don’t. There was never a Palestinian state. The British conquered the land from the Turks, the Jordanians illegally conquered the West Bank from the British, and then we released it.” Bennett’s proposal does not tally with Israeli political consensus, with only about a third of voters supporting annexation. However, his recent success pushing a weakened Netanyahu into supporting another piece of legislation – a proposal to retroactively legalise illegal Jewish outposts built on private Palestinian land – has underlined Bennett’s skills in leveraging the right of the country’s political debate.','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/03/far-right-israel-minister-naftali-bennett-bill-annex-maale-adumim-settlement-palestinian-territories','Far-right Israeli minister plans bill to annex one of biggest settlements',474,'world'),('commentisfree/2017/jan/03/brexit-create-4000000-jobs-economist-change-britain','The costs and benefits of the UK’s membership of the single market were widely debated before the referendum. However, the customs union was hardly mentioned. Yet it is the customs union that permits goods to circulate freely within the EU (and beyond, to a few other countries including, for the most part, Turkey) and which means the EU negotiates trade agreements with non-EU countries as a single entity. So does Brexit mean leaving the customs union? It seems obvious that it would – what’s the point of leaving the EU if we leave the EU in charge of UK trade policy? On the other hand, the Treasury is now taking a good hard look at the costs and logistical implications of having to reinstate at least some border checks for goods flowing between Dover and Calais, or Felixstowe and the continent (not to mention the thorny issue of the Republic of Ireland-Northern Ireland border). There are no simple answers here – while there are undoubtedly short-term costs to leaving, it is perfectly reasonable to argue that if the UK is to make a success of Brexit over the longer term we need the flexibility to formulate our own, independent trade policy. To make an objective assessment of the costs and benefits, you might even want to ask some experts … What you definitely don’t want to do is to listen to anyone who claims that leaving the customs union has no costs, only benefits. But that’s precisely what Change Britain did when it claimed on Tuesday that leaving the customs union – and concluding new free trade deals with countries ranging from India to Korea – could “create 400,000 new jobs”, because of the projected increase in UK exports. Let’s leave aside the fact that India has made it abundantly clear that it’s not interested in a trade deal with the UK as long as we continue to go out of our way to make skilled workers and students from India unwelcome. Let’s even brush over the fact that the EU already has a free trade deal with Korea. Since this has been broadly in force since 2011 – and would not necessarily continue post-Brexit, although it may well do so – this is a potential cost of leaving the customs union, not a benefit. Even more fundamental is the obvious point that the impact of free trade deals – if they are successful – is to increase both exports and imports. Claiming that free trade deals would create British jobs because our exports would go up, but ignoring the fact that our imports would also increase, is either deeply ignorant or deliberately misleading. In fact, almost any economist – regardless of their views of the economics of Brexit – would tell you that over time the impact of trade deals on overall employment in the UK is likely to be negligible or zero. As with its report last week, Change Britain seems to be doing its best to crowd out serious debate on the costs and benefits of leaving the customs union. Meanwhile, back in reality, the Financial Times’ annual survey found that the vast majority of economists remain of the view that Brexit will be a drag on UK growth over the medium to long term. Of course, economists, like others, should not just be asked what they think will happen next, but be held to account for what they predicted in the past. Last year I said that Brexit would have relatively little impact on the economy in the short term (that is, in 2016) but that it would be significant medium-term costs; we will see how that turns out. Less definitively, I also said that the UK could survive and indeed prosper outside of the EU, but there are obvious and serious risks. The current framing of the Brexit debate, across the political spectrum – that we are somehow “trading off” the economic benefits of the single market against the downsides of free movement – illustrates those risks. Restricting trade, capital flows and immigration – reducing the openness of the UK economy – all have negative economic impacts. It is these big choices about the UK’s economic future – not fictional numbers made up for a cheap headline or to support the political agenda of one faction or another – that we should be focusing on as we approach the start of the Brexit process.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/03/brexit-create-4000000-jobs-economist-change-britain','Brexit will create 400,000 jobs?

A leading group of central bankers was due to meet on 8 January to agree changes that could have forced some banks, largely in Europe, to hold more capital, but it was announced on Tuesday that the meeting had been called off. No new date was given for the meeting of the group of central bank governors and heads of supervision (GHOS), which was due to discuss rules that influence how much capital banks hold and the way they measure the risks they are taking. It was reported that the US had been pushing for tighter measures despite concern from European regulators that any further restrictions might impede lending. The postponement comes just weeks before Donald Trump is inaugurated as US president. Trump has discussed the need to change banking regulation. The GHOS, chaired by Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, oversees the Basel committee, the forum where central bankers meet to discuss banking reform. The group said “more time is needed to finalise some work, including ensuring the framework’s final calibration, before the GHOS can review the package of proposals. “A meeting of the GHOS, originally planned for early January, has therefore been postponed.” Stefan Ingves, the Swedish central bank governor who chairs the Basel committee, said it would keep working to “finalise its reforms aimed at fixing shortcomings highlighted by the financial crisis to make banks safer and more resilient”. The difficulties in clinching agreement have been simmering for some time, but in a speech last month Ingves had said the committee was on track to finalise the reforms, known as Basel III, by the end of 2016. The changes relate to banks using their own internal models to measure their risks and the impact this has on risk reduction. Draghi said: “Completing Basel III is an important step towards restoring confidence in banks’ risk-weighted capital ratios, and we remain committed to that goal.” Sir Howard Davies, a professor at the Paris Institute of Political Science, wrote last week that agreement had “ so far proved impossible”. Davies, who is also chairman of Royal Bank of Scotland, said: “The Europeans argue that their banks’ corporate lending is inherently less risky.”','https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/03/global-regulators-postpone-pivotal-banking-reform-meeting','Global regulators postpone pivotal banking reform meeting',476,'business'),('politics/2017/jan/03/morale-is-really-high-lib-dems-scent-revival-in-south-west','The picture-postcard villages in the Blackdown Hills are not normally the scene of political upheaval, but this corner of south-west England could be the scene of an unlikely political revival for the Liberal Democrats. The countryside electorate here on the Somerset-Devon border are historically staunchly Conservative, but just before Christmas the Lib Dem Ross Henley took 71% of the vote with a swing of more than 40% from the Tories in a Taunton Deane borough council byelection with a respectable local turnout. “To be honest I thought we would run the Tories close, I never ever dreamt we would get this vote,” Henley laughed, sitting in the tiny village shop cafe. “But now morale is really high. People helped in this byelection from all over the country.” Lib Dem strategists are pinning their hopes for rebuilding after the dire results in 2015 on a resurgence in the south-west, their former heartland, where the party lost all 10 of its seats in the last election. Since then, the party has been quietly notching up its best council byelection results in 20 years, with a net gain of 28 seats compared with net losses for Labour of four seats, Ukip of three and the Conservatives of 33 seats. On paper, this part of the country does not look like a happy hunting ground for the fervently pro-remain party, because of the high number of leave voters in the south-west. Yet more than half of those byelections gains were in the West Country, most recently in Taunton and Teignbridge in early December, with the seats all seeing swings upwards of 20%. Henley, who is also the county councillor, said he thought local leave voters had still backed him because of a personal relationship, but that his party was consistently winning over Tory remainers. “People did actually want to talk about Brexit on the doorstep,” he said. “It seems to be redefining British politics in the same way the Scottish referendum did, it completely shook up the way people voted. Parties that have a muddled view on the big issues of the day generally tend to struggle. And we know where we stand.” Paul Hodgkinson, the leader of the Lib Dems on Gloucestershire county council, said the party was already showing it could take seats even in some of the darkest blue areas of the country. The local party won the Stow-on-the-Wold council byelection in September with a swing of 21%, taking around 65% of the vote from the seat that houses typically Tory Cotswold villages. “Local council byelections have seen our vote surge. Stow-on-the-Wold was Conservative since time immemorial but we took it with a massive swing,” Hodgkinson said. “On the ground, soft Conservative voters are not happy.” There are 17 key Tory seats where the majority of voters backed remain and Lib Dems are already in second place, such as Lewes, Bath, Cheltenham, Cheadle, Oxford West and Abingdon, according to research by the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe. Gavin Grant, the 61-year-old chair of western counties Liberal Democrats, has spent time since the referendum studying key areas for the 2017 local elections. “Everyone says the south-west was very strongly anti-EU, but it wasn’t,” he insisted. “It’s simply not true. We have analysed the box counts, not just the regions. Outside of London, this was one of the strongest regions for remain in England.” The area has some places which look more promising for the Lib Dems than others. The Cotswolds as a whole narrowly went for remain in the referendum, though the local Conservative MP Geoffrey Clifton-Brown campaigned for Brexit. Cheltenham, which was held by the Lib Dems until 2015, recorded a strong remain vote. But the other end of the county was far stronger for leave, in such places as Tewkesbury. Prof Glen O’Hara, an expert on political history and polling at Oxford Brookes University, said a Lib Dem revival had limitations, especially in Conservative seats with Theresa May’s party polling so high. Even after high-profile success in the Richmond Park byelection, national polling for the Lib Dems has on the whole been stubbornly below double figures, apart from one or two polls that had them at between 12% and 14%. According to Fabian Society analysis this week, Labour has lost as many votes to the Liberal Democrats as it has to the two rightwing, pro-Brexit parties combined. However, the projections also suggest that even if the Lib Dems were to massively exceed expectations to match Labour’s support, with each party taking 20% of the vote, the Lib Dems would only win 26 seats compared with Labour’s 143. “Lib Dem recovery was always going to be spotty and uncertain,” O’Hara said. “Going after remain as hard as they can is a good strategy. There are lots of remainers everywhere – even in Copeland [the Cumbrian seat recently vacated by Labour’s Jamie Reed], which was according to the best figures, 60% leave. That’s a lot more votes than you’ve got already when you’re on 10% in the national polls.” Even in places where leave was strongest, such as Yeovil and rural south Somerset, Grant says the party believes there are enough angry remain voters to take back parliamentary seats. “Our research shows around half of the remain vote see this issue as the single most important issue,” he said. He believes the party now also has a good chance of winning Wiltshire county council in 2017, which would mean taking more than 20 Conservative seats. “It’s a tall order but we are motivated and people are out doing the work in a way I have not seen for years.” Lib Dem membership, now roughly 80,000, has gone up by about 26,000 since the referendum, with approximately 3,000 of those in the south-west. Ryan Hemmings, a 26-year-old conveyancer is one of the party’s new members in Yeovil. “I’d have called myself a bit of a Tory boy before, probably until the referendum and the aftermath,” he said. “It was the Tory conference that really put me off – the economy was the most important thing to me. And instead they used it as a platform to talk about companies listing foreigners.” One of the most high-profile defectors from the Conservatives has been councillor Amanda Broom, who previously worked for Conservative MP Marcus Fysh, but quit her job and her party to join the Lib Dems in April last year. “I thought it would be the job of my dreams,” she said. “But within two months I started to realise there was a very big difference between myself and the Conservatives and feel very uncomfortable. [Former party leader] Paddy Ashdown warned me to pull on my tin hat and said that I would get a lot of criticism. But I had over 200 letters and emails saying they understood.” Her next target is a Ukip-held seat in the county council elections where the Lib Dems had previously come third. “Yes, we can win,” she said. “Half the time it is about the people who can get things done, and that’s definitely something I’ll be playing on.” The party has also held a parliamentary candidate selection blitz since the referendum – fearing a snap general election – so many candidates for 2020 seats have already been selected to try to win back those lost in 2015. Many of them are a new generation of activists, rather than experienced parliamentarians returning. Taunton Deane’s Lib Dem candidate, Gideon Amos, said he had been active in the party in his 20s, but then decided to get fully involved again as he saw the 2015 defeat approaching. “2016 has been a very disturbing year for anyone who is a liberal,” he said. “We are changing our strategy to talk to people who are down on our canvassing records as having always voted Tory. They want to talk to us.” Amos, who will need a swing of 14% to take the seat back, said even leave voters were angered by the lack of information about the plan for Brexit. “People say to me all the time that it’s all a mess. When I ask them what they think about politics, everyone mentions Brexit even though I don’t bring it up. So when you say our position is that the deal should be available to look at, to vote on, it’s not [unpopular].” Daisy Benson, the party’s candidate in Ashdown’s former seat in Yeovil, said the party was right to throw everything it could at even the smallest byelections. “I care about social justice and inequality but I also think that if you don’t win elections, you can’t do much about it,” she said. “When I was lead councillor for housing in Reading, I could actually change things.” Behind the counter in North Perott farm shop, deep in south Somerset, where Benson is hoping to unseat the Conservative MP Fysh, the shop’s owner, Jonathan Hoskyns, said Conservative campaigners “carpeted the place” during the 2015 campaign with warnings about a Labour-SNP coalition government. “David Laws [the then Lib Dem MP] was in government and we didn’t see much of him until I think his party realised it was too late,” he said. “They are more prepared now. Paddy Ashdown was a Marmite character but well respected. But this area has been Conservative before 2015, it does switch hands. In Taunton town centre, where the referendum vote was about 59% leave, some locals appeared unready to commit to backing the party again. Retired engineer Jim Cawston, 75, said he had voted to leave but had previously voted Lib Dem and would not rule out doing so again. “I saw the money we sent [to the EU] and the council here’s bankrupt,” he said. “But to be honest with you, no one seems to know what they are doing now.” However, Georgina, a 22-year-old student visiting her native Somerset for the Christmas break, said she believed the referendum had politicised a lot of younger voters. “Yeah I do feel angry [about Brexit],” she said. “I do have a lot of friends who have said they would just definitely vote for a remain party, whoever it was.” Benson said she believed that whatever people now thought of the party, the referendum had given it a clear reason to continue to exist. “People would slam the door in your face in 2011 and say: ‘You lied, you broke your promises,’” she said. “Now, if you are concerned about Brexit, it’s very clear you can talk to us. All the time we used to get: ‘We don’t know what you stand for.’ I don’t think we’re going to get that anymore.”','https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/03/morale-is-really-high-lib-dems-scent-revival-in-south-west','\'Morale is really high\': Lib Dems scent revival in south-west',477,'politics'),('sport/2017/jan/03/bradford-bulls-go-into-liquidation','The former Super League champions Bradford Bulls have gone into liquidation but talks are already under way to reform the club in time for the new season. The administrators of the Championship side, who were relegated from the top division for the first time in 2014, failed to finalise a deal to save them after the club entered administration for the third time in four years in November. The administrators rejected an offer last week from a consortium led by the former New Zealand Rugby League chairman Andrew Chalmers, despite approval from the Rugby Football League. Another consortium subsequently expressed an interest but that bid fell through late on Monday after the unnamed party withdrew their interest. The club are reported to have debts of £1m and further funding shortfall of another £1m. Several parties have already expressed an interest in reforming the four-times Super League champions. The RFL is hopeful of a club being put together within the next seven days, with the hope they could begin the season as planned in the Championship. Bradford were due to begin their campaign against Hull Kingston Rovers on 5 February. “The board recognises the need to balance competition integrity while protecting the reputation of the sport and acknowledges that all other clubs in the league have prepared for the competition in 2017 on the presumption that Bradford would be competing in the Championship,” said the RFL’s chief executive, Nigel Wood. He called the situation at Bradford “as acute as any experienced” but confirmed that any reformed Bradford side would be invited to assume the former team’s membership slot but with a 12-point penalty. “We found out on Tuesday afternoon,” the club’s interim general manager, Stuart Duffy, said. “We were looking forward to good news and had heard nothing to the contrary over the holiday period. Everyone is in total and utter shock.” It is thought the RFL was hesitant to place a newly reformed Bradford into the bottom professional tier, League 1, owing to the problems arising from asking a side in that division to make the step up at such short notice, only weeks from the beginning of the season. Bradford’s squad – some of whom took to social media on Tuesday to confirm the news – are now free agents. Super League sides who have already spent their salary cap for the 2017 season will be given dispensation from the RFL to sign players outside of the cap on a case-by-case basis. The Bulls were scheduled to play their first pre-season friendly next Sunday, against Batley: it is unclear whether the game will go ahead. The former Great Britain and England player Leon Pryce, who began his career at Bradford and rejoined them for the 2017 season, tweeted: “Sorry for players staff fans – everyone involved @BradfordBullsRL we have been liquidated. For the first time in my life I’m lost for words.”','https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jan/03/bradford-bulls-go-into-liquidation','Bradford Bulls go into liquidation after years of financial struggle',478,'sport'),('global-development/2017/jan/03/drought-worsens-deadly-conflict-between-fulani-herdsmen-nigeria-farmers','Rachel Amida*, a 52-year-old farmer in Adamawa state, north-eastern Nigeria, points to a small heap of maize laid on the ground just outside her home. “If it wasn’t for the herdsmen we would have had much more,” she says. “It is making it harder to survive when we are harvesting only a portion of what we sowed.” On both sides of the Yola-Gombe road that runs through Adamawa’s vast countryside, small groups of herdsmen lead scores of cattle through the fields to feed. The herders, mostly northern Fulani, are sometimes young children. Tiny figures beneath their large, wide-brimmed hats, they carry bows and arrows as they shuttle their cattle south in the heat. Yet their novel appearance belies a deadly crisis that, in the past few years, has spiralled out of control. On 3 November, near Amida’s home in a village in Demsa district, two people were killed by Fulani herdsmen. “I now have to send my son to my plot to till the land,” she says. “Before we thrashed the crops outside, but now we do them in here. It’s more dangerous there now.” Farmers have accused the herdsmen of trespassing on their farmland to graze their cattle, destroying their crops. The Fulani herdsmen have always ventured in search of land on which to feed their cattle; some are semi-nomadic, rooted in communities across Nigeria, while others travel along courses leading from Niger and Chad to Nigeria. But the combined effect of competition for land and droughts has made their search increasingly desperate. Reprisal attacks and provocations exist on both sides. Cattle are sometimes stolen from herdsmen by criminal groups and communities often attack the herdsmen, assuming them to be a threat. But the conflict has been deadly for farming communities. In August, more than 30 people were killed when herdsmen attacked villages in Demsa. In the three months prior to this, another 50 people were killed in escalating attacks that led to crisis meetings involving the governor of the state and local rulers. The perennial conflict, for years confined mainly to “middle-belt” states, has now spread around the country, with mass killings increasingly reported in southern states over the past year. In Plateau state, where such conflict has a long history, some locals feel the attacks are part of an effort to get farming communities to leave their land, allowing the herdsmen to settle without competition for resources. “That’s why they attack villages – they don’t just attack because of quarrels with villagers,” said a farmer who did not want to be named. “They burn homes and farms so that we will have to start again somewhere else. But we can’t, and will not leave because this is our land.” According to John Reginald, a worker from Nigeria-based NGO Crudan, the attacks have met little resistance from police or the military. “This crisis has been able to go on partly because there is very little security present in village communities, and attacks in rural fields are hard to police,” he said. “So most times when the herdsmen attack, or when these issues take place, by the time people hear about it, it’s too late to stop.” According to the World Bank, 52% of Nigerians still live in rural areas, where people are most vulnerable to sporadic, sustained attacks. The federal government’s response to the crisis has been widely criticised by the Nigerian press as inadequate. Increasingly, the killings have been viewed as motivated along religious and ethnic lines. President Muhammadu Buhari’s ethnicity – he is a Fulani Muslim – has fed accusations that the government is reluctant to confront a group it has sympathies with. But according to Sola Tayo, a Nigeria specialist at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London, the crisis is more complicated. “I think this series of conflicts is multifaceted,” she explains. “The mistake is to reduce it to a simple clash of ethnicities or religions. “There seems to be little appetite to address some of these historic grievances concerning grazing at a national level in government. Most of the discussion seems to be taking place at state level with some governors more keen to engage with farmers and herders to try and seek some sort of workable solution, while others are adopting a more hostile approach through tightening restrictions on nomadic herding practices.” A plan by the federal government to allocate grazing reserves was rejected by Nigeria’s parliament. In opposition to the government’s position, some states such as Ekiti and Abia are passing legislation to allow them to limit the herdsmen’s activities, and prosecute those who graze on private land. In Kaduna, the state government has admitted to having paid compensation to aggrieved herdsmen to stop further killings. In some cases, farmers have taken to burning their land after they’ve collected the harvest – to deny passing herdsmen farmland to graze on – despite the fact that it damages the soil. The effects of the conflict on communities, particularly across the north-east, has been severe. A drought across the Lake Chad basin that has affected north-eastern Nigeria and other areas of west Africa has sharply decreased crop yields. Adamawa, like much of north-eastern Nigeria, is hugely reliant on agriculture, and the population is now vulnerable. For many families, the crops are their sole source of income and food. The crisis is even more acute for the 166,000 people living in Adamawa who were displaced by Boko Haram from their homes in neighbouring states. Tearfund, an NGO working in Nigeria, has been helping internally displaced people in Adamawa, supplying farming tools and providing training on dry season farming techniques. “Most of the IDPs who are here were farmers or wives of farmers in states like Borno,” explains Munene Kibera, a disaster response manager at Tearfund. “It’s the main thing that they know how to do so it’s the best way for them to survive.” The crisis has had a significant impact in Adamawa, a state with already stretched resources due to the huge influx of IDPs. The number of people reliant on land to farm for food is increasing just when climate change has made farming more difficult. As a result, the land disputes with the herdsmen are likely to increase. Despite the many deaths and federal government statements, there is little sign of the crisis coming to an end. “All we can do is manage with what we can farm,” Amida says. “It is a bad situation, but we are powerless to stop it because they are armed and we are not.” * Name changed to protect identity','https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/jan/03/drought-worsens-deadly-conflict-between-fulani-herdsmen-nigeria-farmers','Drought worsens deadly battle between Fulani herdsmen and farmers in Nigeria',479,'global-development'),('uk-news/2017/jan/03/afghan-teen-detained-home-office-threatens-kill-himself','An Afghan teenager has vowed to kill himself behind bars in a detention centre near Gatwick airport rather than be forcibly returned to Afghanistan, where he says he will be killed by the Taliban. Idress Wazeer, 18, has twice attempted to take his own life since being detained by the Home Office in Brook House immigration removal centre last month and told that he would be forcibly removed from the UK any time in the next 30 days. Wazeer arrived in the UK when he was 14, after fleeing persecution by the Taliban, and claimed asylum. He says the Taliban attacked him and shot him in the leg, leaving a variety of scars on his body, and that his family were killed by the Taliban because of work his brother did for a non-governmental organisation (NGO) disapproved of by the Taliban. Home Office officials dispute his age and say he was 16 when he arrived in the UK. Wazeer said: “I am very scared about being sent back to Afghanistan. I am determined to kill myself rather than be forced back to my country. The Taliban killed my mum, my dad and my brother and I’m not going to let them kill me, too.” He added: “I’m so depressed that I can’t eat and can’t sleep. I’m very frightened about what’s going to happen to me. I’m too young to deal with all this.” Wazeer’s first attempt to kill himself was on Christmas Eve while in his room with fellow detainee Michele Terzaghi, an Italian. The alarm was raised and healthcare officials administered first aid. He was then taken to a part of the wing called the care and separation room where he was kept under constant supervision for 24 hours before being released back to the room he shares with Terzaghi. He made a second attempt on 30 December, but again Terzaghi intervened. Again Wazeer was taken to the care and separation room for 24 hours. Terzaghi expressed concern about Wazeer’s welfare and said he feels traumatised from witnessing the two attempts. “I was frozen with fear when I saw Idress trying to [kill] himself. I was pressing the emergency buzzer and kept thinking to myself: ‘What happens if he dies now?’ This guy is absolutely petrified. He has bullet wounds on his leg from where the Taliban shot him. He considers himself to be British and it’s very overwhelming for him to be taken back to somewhere he considers to be hell.” Wazeer’s girlfriend, 20, who asked not to be named, also expressed concern about him. “I have known Idress for years,” she said. “He is very protective of his friends and we are very protective of him. He has said to me that 100% he will kill himself rather than go back to Afghanistan.” Wazeer requested that a rule 35 report be carried out to assess whether or not he should be detained. Survivors of torture are not routinely supposed to be detained and rule 35 reports are designed to identify the most vulnerable detainees. The Home Office rejected his rule 35 report. However, these reports have been criticised as defective by a range of people and organisations including the high court judge Mr Justice Ouseley, who said the reports are not “the effective safeguards they are supposed to be”. The shortcomings of these reports have also been criticised by the home affairs select committee and the UN committee against torture. G4S has the contract to run Brook House. Ben Saunders, director for Gatwick immigration removal centres, said: “Our team works tirelessly to keep safe those in our care and the most recent report from independent monitors recognised the good work done to support distressed and vulnerable detainees. In this case, on-site healthcare teams provided medical attention and appropriate safeguarding support arrangements were put in place.” Theresa Schleicher, casework manager for Medical Justice, a charity that works to protect the health of people in detention, said: “We are regularly contacted by vulnerable detainees whose mental health is deteriorating in detention and who are not identified and not released due to ineffective safeguards. “We are particularly concerned about the new practice of giving ‘open’ notices of removal as has happened in this case where a detainee can be forcibly returned without notice any day during a three-month period. This makes it increasingly difficult for legal representatives and NGOs like us to plan the work we need to do on detainees’ cases.” A Home Office spokesman said: “We do not routinely comment on individual cases.” In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.

The eight-time Olympic medallist, who called time on his cycling career at the end of 2016, will follow in the footsteps of sporting stars such as the rower Sir Steve Redgrave, gymnast Beth Tweddle and swimmer Rebecca Adlington, all of whom were forced to pull out of the competition due to injuries. The former Tour De France champion, 36, does not seem fazed by the show’s history and said he is looking forward to taking his other favourite sport to the next level. “Skiing is a big passion of mine, it was a mix of that and the other committed names this year that made me want to sign up,” Wiggins said. “Major retiring Olympians such as Sir Steve Redgrave have also trod this path, I see this as a sporting challenge and want to go out there and win it. Just don’t call me a celebrity.” Wiggins’s comments jar slightly with those made in an interview with the Guardian last year, when he made his thoughts on reality shows clear: “You don’t want to become just this pointless celebrity who’s here, there and everywhere, going on Can’t Cook, Won’t Cook. I don’t want to become a captain on Question Of Sport and go on every week playing the fool.” Having recently retired from a 15-year cycling career with five Olympic gold medals under his belt, Wiggins will be joining the former England rugby captain Jason Robinson, Olympic gymnast Louis Smith and two-time Olympic taekwondo champion Jade Jones in the show’s fourth series. Also taking part are the former Liverpool and England footballer Robbie Fowler, Gareth Thomas – who won 100 rugby union caps for Wales and four as in rugby league – and Paralympian Kadeena Cox, who won gold, silver and bronze across two disciplines at Rio 2016. Wiggins is the 14th and final name to sign up to the six-week competition, which will see participants take on challenges in snow sports. The Jump will return to Channel 4 within the next few months but a start date has yet to be confirmed. The channel launched a safety review after last year’s series saw a string of injuries, the most serious of which was to Tweddle, who underwent surgery to fuse fractured vertebrae.

North Korea nuclear attack ‘won’t happen’, says Trump Donald Trump has said no North Korean nuclear bomb will reach the US mainland, a day after the regime in Pyongyang claimed it was close to test-launching an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). “North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the US,” Trump said on Twitter. “It won’t happen!” It was not clear whether the president-elect believed North Korea was incapable of developing a reliable ICBM, or that the US would prevent it doing so. Trump also added a criticism of China, which he said drained the US economy but refused to rein in its ally in Pyongyang. Kim announced his country was in the final stages of testing the ICBM, which in theory could travel 5,500 miles needed to reach the US, during a New Year’s address.

According to the site, precise figures are not available because, in the current reporting environment, it is more challenging to monitor downloads. But it says its estimates are based on several sources, including public BitTorrent trackers. TorrentFreak says pirated versions of Deadpool emerged shortly before the film’s cinema release in February, and illegal downloads number in the “millions”. The film scored over $783m at the global box office. Two more high-performing superhero films occupied second and third spots, with the popularity of Batman v Superman and Captain America: Civil War appearing to conform to the presumed comic-book sensibilities of torrent users. The former was released in March 2016, the latter in April. Two more comic-book adaptations – X-Men Apocalypse and Suicide Squad – also feature on the list. The appetite for pirated films also appeared to run along box-office lines, although videogame adaptation Warcraft and Independence Day: Resurgence performed relatively poorly at the box office (with, respectively, $386m and $389m globally), suggesting that piracy could have taken a significant bite out of revenues for both films.

Fun, isn’t it, for various reasons. The Christmas holidays are a period of particularly heavy drinking for many of the UK population, so much so that January often feels like one long national hangover. This often combines with the sense of “starting afresh” and the ritual of New Year’s Resolutions and results in a period of abstention. In recent years, it’s become fashionable to swear off alcohol for the whole of January, often (but not always) as part of an overall effort to improve general fitness and lose weight. But, is this necessary? Or is it possible to have your pint and down it, and lose weight while carrying on indulging in the booze? On paper, it looks like a big ask. It’s easy to see why people find giving up drinking a bit of a challenge. It has pleasurable effects, it aids social interaction, in the UK at least it’s often expected that you’ll drink at social occasions, and if you’re a regular drinker then you’re brain and body will likely have adapted to expect a regular intake. But all this comes at a cost to the body. Alcohol is second only to fats in terms of the amount of energy per mass it contains. In plain English, alcohol delivers about 7 calories per gram consumed (fat delivers closer to 9 calories per gram). And that’s just the pure alcohol, the ethanol, in your drink. The stuff around it (the beer, the stout, the cocktail ingredients, the mixers) add substantially more. What’s more, these are “empty” calories. The point of drinking is to get the intoxicating effect, not to nourish the body in some way, so physiologically we’re just pouring pointless calories down our throat. However, scientific analysis offers some way to potentially “game the system”, and not just lose weight while continuing to drink, but use the effects of alcohol to increase your chances of getting in shape! Here are a few suggestions. Pub runs One of the problems with drinking from a weight-gain perspective is that, as well as pointless calories, it also involves very little physical movement. Sitting down and talking for hours isn’t exactly good cardio. You need to engage in a lot more physical movement if you want to burn off those calories. So, if you really do fancy a drink, don’t stroll to the local, jog there. In fact, don’t go to your local, pick a pub on the other side of town and jog there instead. Or pick several pubs and sprint from one to the next each time you finish a drink, more of a pub sprint than a pub crawl. This has the added bonus of, at the end of the night, if you arrive at the last pub red-faced, struggling to speak or walk, you’ll fit right in. You might look at this and decide it’s not worth it just for a drink so opt to stay in. If so, fine. That’s good for your health too. So really, you can’t lose here. Indulge in impulsivity One thing alcohol is known to do is make people more impulsive. The complex interaction between alcohol and our brains and genes means our higher-reasoning areas and those that supress impulsivity are often hampered by drink, resulting in us doing and saying things we’d normally shy away from. You can exploit this effect to improve your health by signing up for fitness classes, marathons, Tough Mudder runs, and things like that. You may have consumed a lot of empty calories but thanks to drink you’re now going to burn those off, and then some. Obviously, once you sober up, you could just change your mind. It’s harder than you think though, as our brains are reluctant to go back on a decision once it’s made. This is especially true if you made the decision in front of people, who will now think worse of you if you go back on it. When you wake with a pounding head saying “What the hell did I agree to last night?”, it may well have been good for you in the long run. Embrace the anger One other unpleasant effect of alcohol, which ties in with greater impulsivity, is an increase in irritability and anger. There are many neuropsychological explanations for this; an inability to correctly work out people’s intentions from their behaviour, a drop in ability to plan actions and predict consequences, releasing pre-existing stresses and issues that you usually supress, and so on. One consequence of increased anger is an increase in “approach” motivation. The brain seems to have two separate motivations systems, approach and avoidance. Things we want to deal with, we’re motivated to approach. Things we are wary or scared of, we’re motivated to avoid. Anger increases the power of the approach system, meaning we “get stuck in” where we otherwise wouldn’t. So, if you’re drunkenly tempted to pick a fight with the biggest bruiser in the room, go ahead. The realisation of what you’ve done will soon get through your alcohol-infused brain, triggering an adrenaline-rush fight-or-flight response. You’ll have no choice but to get moving to stay ahead of the enraged beast, burning many calories as he chases you with a pool cue. Blank the workout Alcohol, at the right doses, can and does disrupt the ability to form new memories. So, if you have a gym session or exercise routine planned, you could dry quickly getting so drunk beforehand your brain can’t form new memories, but you can still complete your workout before passing out from intoxication. When you eventually wake up, you should have no memory of exercising, so will think you still need to do it. Voila; you get to drink and actually double the exercise you partake in. It’s a delicate balancing act though, to get the timing and intake just right to hit that narrow window of usefulness. So practice is needed, which may well render the whole thing pointless. Try moderation You may think all these suggestions fall into the category of “terrible” or maybe even “downright hazardous to health, life and liberty”. And you’d be right. Truth is, alcohol isn’t ever really going to be helpful if you’re trying to lose weight and get in shape. That’s just not how our bodies work. But that doesn’t mean you have to cut it out entirely. Each to their own, and many people just cut down and/or increase their physical activity, or some combination of the two. You need to find what works for you. Of course, this involves navigating the onslaught of “expert” advice and trendy “diets” we are bombarded with at this time of year. It’s enough to drive you to drink.

I keep reminding myself that she would have laughed in my face. That’s enough of a reason to keep this saccharine-free. Rob Delaney and I were desperate to get Carrie in our show. Even three series in, we could still barely believe it. To begin with, we treated her like everyone else did: as an icon, not a real human. Which is why, I think, it took a while to become pals. And because she mostly turned down my invitations, with charming, poetic and hilarious texts. Sometimes she was tired; sometimes it was just not the right night for her. I invited her to a dinner where I thought (knew) she would like the other guests and they would (of course) like her. She messaged to say that she wasn’t in the right frame of mind for new people, that she would be better off with people who already knew her madness, so she could relax and be as crazy as she fancied. She turned down the invitation, but she made me promise never to stop asking. And I didn’t. When she came to my house in Hackney, we sat on a sofa with our dogs and talked about everything. Mainly her life. She talked about herself a lot, thankfully, because it was always, always entertaining and wise and scattershot and full of quips and quotes with a dash of subliminal therapy. But her life was complicated. There was pain there, and responsibility, and her own demons. It added up to a head full of aggravation, as well as incredible anecdotes. I asked her when she ever got to have a moment of normal. She pointed at me and then back at herself on the sofa and said: “Doing this.” The night before she got her flight back to Los Angeles, we had dinner. It was the day after our last day’s filming of Catastrophe and I was monstrously hungover and tired and incapable. I tried to cry off and she reminded me that she had dragged her ass all the way out to Hackney to see me the week before and I should return the favour. So I did. Thank the dark lord, I did. Her good, long-term pal Salman Rushdie was there, too. I had used him as my first reason not to join. “I’m not feeling smart enough to talk to him.” Her response was: “Are you kidding? He’s just gonna talk about girls.” So we met and chatted and laughed and Gary (her dog) farted while Carrie handed out presents (me, an antique cocktail stick holder; Salman, a pair of chocolate tits). When he popped to the loo, Carrie said: “See? Isn’t he fun? Do you like him?” Of course I did. But what I liked more was that she cared enough to make sure I was having fun. And that was her wont. If she felt that she was talking about herself too much, she would say: “Wait! What about you? We haven’t talked about you.” But who would want to do anything but listen to a lady like her with a life like that? It was, as she described it, something of a soap opera. She was no ordinary celebrity. She was, she said, Mickey Mouse. Everybody owned a piece, or felt they had the right to a piece. But the beautiful truth about Carrie is that she was genuine. She knew her talents, she knew her cultural importance, but she was humble, too. She didn’t have to feign her modesty. Her modesty and insecurity were part of her makeup. She was so real that it was almost dangerous. Actually, it was dangerous. Because she didn’t play the game. She said what she thought and, in an industry where that’s not always welcome, it sometimes came back to bite her. But she couldn’t help herself. She had very little filter. My God, girls, we owe her a lot. Not many women of her generation called out the double standards of the film industry the way she did. And how it treats women of a certain age. She knew that a man in her position wouldn’t have got the flak that she got. And he didn’t. She knew that she had to keep mouthing off about it. And she did it with great wit. But it hurt her. Make no mistake about that. She was very aware of what people thought and said. And I didn’t like that she felt so hurt by it, and I didn’t like that she criticised her own looks so much. But it’s hard not to, when the world is telling you that you’re not allowed to age like a regular human. When she was going up to her room after dinner, she was mocking herself for her slow pace, her “old lady body”. She looked back at me and said: “If I’d known back then that I had something worth looking at, I’d have looked after it better. I was in good shape.” Then she passed a hallway mirror and took a quick glance. “But I’m not in such bad shape now.” I’m glad I got to hear her say that, a rare moment of uncritical self-love. Carrie Fisher isn’t around any more. And that’s just horrible. As my dad said: shit happens, but some shit is worse than others. And I want everyone to remember her and all the great things she was. A wonderful writer, a fine actress, a great mother, a caring daughter, a loyal friend, a wit, a prolific present-giver, a lunatic, a legend.','https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/jan/03/carrie-fisher-sharon-horgan-so-real-it-was-dangerous','Sharon Horgan: ‘Carrie Fisher was so real it was dangerous’',486,'culture'),('commentisfree/2017/jan/03/disability-accessible-toilets-paralympian-train','We all need to go. And however we need to do this, we should have privacy as well as access to fulfil this most basic biological need freely and with dignity. I ached with sympathy on hearing about Anne Wafula Strike’s experience. The award-winning Paralympic athlete and disabilities campaigner says she was “robbed of her dignity” after a train company failed to provide an accessible toilet on a three-hour journey. And I felt an old, weary anger. You might believe the Paralympian’s distressing experience is an unusual occurrence, but sadly it isn’t. The reality for many disabled people is it’s a muddle and a minefield to have an easy pee. While situations such as Wafula Strike’s are unacceptable and degrading, sometimes they can be horribly funny. A few years ago I went to New York with Virgin. The cabin crew were charming, but I ended up about as far away from the appropriate toilet as I could be. And what with the faffing about that occurs before and after you board as a disabled person, this meant at least a seven-hour wait. Luckily my personal assistant, Janet, was undaunted. We made it to the general toilet, only to discover that the cubicle was so small it looked unlikely we would fit in it together and so we did what has now gone down in our personal history as the belly dance. We manoeuvred: left a bit, right a bit, belly shift sideways. Somehow she got me on that tiny bog. And goodness, did I enjoy my comedy-length wee. I’ve had run-ins with Virgin train lavatories too. Take many journeys west, and there’s a doomed inevitability that the multipurpose toilet will break down. The wheelchair space is very close to the toilet. That’s good – but not when it fails, and is emitting the stench of a medieval cesspit. Even when the train toilets work, many are just too small if you need a PA or carer, and to take your wheelchair into the cubicle. This has been true for me on every Eurostar trip I’ve made. Maybe I’ll need to get creative and wear triple Pampers when I am next en route to Marseille. Like Wafula Strike, in her unpleasant situation, I’ve wet myself (or worse) due to any number of avoidable toilet obstacles. Many disabled people are familiar with parents wanting to use the often dual-purpose accessible toilet to change a child’s nappy. In my case, a young woman “nipping in” with a grizzling toddler once meant that I found myself forlorn and embarrassed, sitting in soggy knickers and left with a rank chair cushion. Another irritant is when the accessible loo is used as a storage room. Pubs and clubs are particularly guilty of this habit, and roll out a tired argument when challenged: we don’t get many disabled people in here. Really, I ask. I wonder why. Sometimes there are obstacles plonked in front of the door: anything from high chairs, bikes and toilet rolls to – I remember once – three woebegone dogs. And no one responsible for moving any of them. There’s controversy about who is disabled “enough” to use an accessible toilet. As a wheelchair user, I try to withhold judgment, not least because not all people in need of an accessible loo will look disabled. I have friends with IBS, stoma bags and long-term medical conditions who all need the space as much as I do. The supermarket Asda has made good efforts to address this situation. But for every genuine case there is always the young guy dashing out of my local M&amp;S loo in smart new trainers – box left inside. The Radar key scheme, to get into more than 9,000 accessible toilets, was set up in 1981 by the organisation that morphed into Disability Rights UK. You can still buy the keys from them, and even on eBay. This may explain another unpalatable experience for the disabled visitor in need: the leftover paraphernalia of drug use. Last year in a Radar accessible toilet I discovered a dirty syringe in the bowl. There has been an effort to improve access to toilets for people needing a hoist and a bench with the Changing Places campaign. I’ve used a few of these, and while I don’t need a hoist I do appreciate the provision of a space where I can fit – with my PA. Still, these are relatively few in number compared with standard accessible toilets. There is, of course, another use for the accessible toilet: it’s a good space for a shag. And I can hardly complain about that, as I’m as guilty as anyone. But there is a serious point here. Even this week, in a store at the sales, I found myself facing yet another out-of-order sign on the accessible toilet, as I watched everyone else doing what they needed to without a thought. I’m still angry every time this happens – we have to be. And I wish – as non-disabled people wish – to have a toilet available wherever I am when nature calls.','https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/03/disability-accessible-toilets-paralympian-train','It’s a disgrace that a Paralympian had to wet herself on a train – but not a surprise | Penny Pepper',487,'commentisfree'),('film/filmblog/2017/jan/03/fifty-shades-darker-trailer-review-theres-a-new-mystery-woman-in-town','Right, OK, yes, look. I have reviewed the trailer for Fifty Shades Darker, the partially awaited sequel to Fifty Shades of Grey, once already. And now I’m going to review it again. But that’s because a new trailer has been released. And this one is quite a departure from the first one because it includes a song by Zayn from One Direction and Taylor Swift instead of that version of Crazy in Love that sounds as if Beyoncé is singing it through a heavy cold. That’s enough to warrant another review, isn’t it? Part one: the reconciliation The trailer opens with the story of how Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey got back together. First he bought her flowers, then he invited her to dinner. But this is a new Anastasia. Now she is her own woman. So she agrees to go to dinner with Christian, but only because she says she’s hungry. Then she pays the dinner bill, even though the restaurant only serves tea and the only other customers are women in silly hats. Then, finally, she beats him at pool. Does her new tactic of weak-kneed almost-dominance work? Well, she ends up getting touched up in a lift, so let’s say yes. Part two: the mystery It’s all going well for Anastasia and Christian. They’re back doing Anastasia and Christian things, like staring mournfully through sheets of glass and dry-humping in showers and … wait, did you see that? That girl! She’s … oh, no, wait, she’s gone. OH GOD THERE SHE IS AGAIN! WHO COULD SHE POSSIBL … oh, hang on, it’s OK, she’s gone again. Now, I haven’t seen the finished film, but I hope this woman pops up in a different place and then disappears over and over again for about 45 minutes. That’d be fun, wouldn’t it. It’d be like panto. Part three: the mystery deepens This mysterious woman appears to be a figure from Christian’s past. She could even be an Anastasia prototype, used and abused and flung to one side when Christian grew bored of her. If that’s the case, she might be out for revenge, because she’s Tipp-Exed some of his car. Meanwhile, Anastasia has her own issues. A man finds her to tell her how controlling and abusive Christian is. I mean, sure, he’s decided to tell her this by pinning her against a wall, looming over her and shouting in her face, which sort of negates his message. But, yes, sure, Christian is the controlling and abusive one. Part four: the motto Because this film has the word darker in the title, you see. And after all, Fifty Shades of Grey really was a fairytale. Admittedly, it was the sort of fairytale in which the princess has no discernible personality of any description, and the happy ending involves her getting repeatedly hit with a belt. But fine, it’s a fairytale. Part five: the helicopter crash A helicopter crashes in this film. That’s about it. Part six: the dramatic conclusion Look, it’s the girl who kept vanishing from earlier in the trailer. And now she’s got a gun. Hey, young lady, shoot me first so I don’t have to keep reviewing trailers for this film! Please!','https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2017/jan/03/fifty-shades-darker-trailer-review-theres-a-new-mystery-woman-in-town','Fifty Shades Darker trailer review: fancy a lift?',488,'film'),('environment/2017/jan/03/conservationists-get-their-talons-out-for-japans-owl-cafes','Several owl species sit tied to a makeshift wooden perch as a TV plays a loud, animated owl-themed film behind them in the dimly lit room. This is Tokyo’s Forest of Owl cafe, filled with locals and snap-happy tourists even on a weekday morning, and as the countdown to 2017 begins, its resident owls will be petted and photographed by more Japanese customers than usual as people seek good fortune for the New Year. Fukurō – the Japanese word for owl – means good luck or protection from hardship. Here, owls aren’t merely lucky, they’re cute, or kawaii, which is a culture all on its own in Japan. The Akiba Fukurou cafe website promises customers a relaxing experience and claims owls are like therapy for “tired hearts”. But bird of prey experts warn that owls make terrible pets and welfare groups consider cafe conditions questionable, if not abusive. “Owls have acute hearing and vision and are birds of prey who have evolved perfectly for flight and precision hunting,” said Peta in a statement. “It’s cruel to deny wild animals the opportunity to fulfil their basic behavioural needs by intensively confining them and exposing them to constant human harassment.” Rob Laidlaw, executive director of the charity Zoocheck, says animal cafe environments can cause “chronic stress, negative emotional states, and deteriorating physical health”, which could cause owls to bite or scratch visitors. Though owl cafe practices vary in Japan, with only some allowing petting, animal rights groups believe many of them violate legal welfare requirements by restraining owls with ropes and disrupting natural sleep cycles by keeping them awake during the day. Japan’s welfare laws offer limited guidance but improvements may be on the horizon, says Sayoko Yamada, director of the Kanagawa Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Yamada predicts legislators will amend Japan’s animal welfare laws by 2020, anticipating international scrutiny accompanying the 2020 Olympics. It is believed that Japan passed its first animal welfare legislation in 1973 just in time for a visit from Queen Elizabeth II. For the time being, animal cafes are on the rise in Japan. According to the website Where in Tokyo, the Japanese capital has 48 animal cafes featuring a range of inhabitants, from cats and dogs to birds and snakes. Fourteen of Tokyo’s animal cafes are bird-centric. At least half of Tokyo’s eight owl cafes opened in the last two years. Some believe the surge stems from Japan’s obsession with trendiness – cat cafes are now so abundant, they’re passé – but owl popularity is also linked to the popularity of Harry Potter. In the UK, where pet owls are legal, ownership was negligible prior to the publication of the Harry Potter books, spiked during the height of the series’ popularity, and dropped off by the time the final book Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was published. Once people realised the cost and complexity of caring for an owl, they abandoned their feathered pets. JK Rowling publicly denounced the practice of keeping owls as sanctuaries had to make room for neglected animals. But in 2015, 60,000 Londoners bid for the chance to visit a pop-up owl cafe that promised to donate proceeds to an owl charity. Japan’s attractions do not claim to advance conservation. Animal experts acknowledge that cafes may foster animal appreciation but say they are more likely to inspire customers to buy pet owls than donate to animal welfare. Sumo Yamamoto, a Japanese owl expert, does not consider the trend for owl cafes an immediate threat to the conservation of owl species as most birds on display are bred in captivity, either in Japan or abroad. However, chicks stolen illegally from the wild sometimes end up in legal markets. In 2014, a Belgian court convicted four traders of forging trade permits for endangered species to make chicks caught in the wild appear to be captive-bred; the traders were part of a larger crime syndicate involved in fraudulent bird of prey trade throughout parts of Europe and the UK.','https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/03/conservationists-get-their-talons-out-for-japans-owl-cafes','Conservationists get their talons out for Japan\'s owl cafes',489,'environment'),('film/2017/jan/03/marine-le-pen-film-chez-nous-front-national-lucas-belvaux','A film about the rise of far-right populism has triggered outrage in France after its trailer appeared to showcase a character based on Marine Le Pen, the president of the Front National and a candidate in France’s 2017 presidential election. Chez Nous (AKA This Is Our Land) stars Émilie Duquenne as a nurse who becomes a political success in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region after becoming involved with the Patriotic Bloc, a thinly disguised fictional version of the Front National. It is due for release in France on 22 February, two months before the first round of voting, and the trailer briefly features a character apparently modelled on Le Pen, played by veteran performer Catherine Jacob. Leading Front National figures have reacted with disdain, with the party’s vice-president, Florian Philippot, saying it was “scandalous” and “unacceptable” that a “clearly anti-Front National” film was being released so close to the election. “Having seen the trailer ... it looks like a real turkey,” he said. Chez Nous is directed and co-written by Belgian film-maker Lucas Belvaux, best known for the three-film 2002 offering Trilogy. He was quoted by BFMTV as saying: “Philippot has only seen the trailer so it’s a cheap controversy which avoids the debate about the message of the film.” Belvaux added: “It’s not so much an anti-FN film as a film about the populist message and how people relate to politics. It’s voters that interest me, not political parties.” Belvaux denied he was taking on the Front National’s politics. “It is not a militant film: it is a committed film, and a civic-minded film. It was made to provoke discussion, not to provoke the FN or fear of the FN,” he said.','https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/03/marine-le-pen-film-chez-nous-front-national-lucas-belvaux','Thinly disguised Marine Le Pen movie character arouses fury of Front National',490,'film'),('uk-news/2017/jan/03/siblings-found-dead-at-foot-of-dover-cliffs-were-twins-police-say','The siblings who were found dead at the foot of Dover cliffs on New Year’s Day were twins, police have said. The pair, who have not been formally identified, were aged 59 and from the Elton area of Cheshire. Police said the brother and sister had been in London on 22 December before travelling to Dover on Boxing Day. Their bodies were found at the bottom of Langdon Cliffs on Sunday 1 January. DS Stuart Ward said: “We know they were in London on 22 December and we can place them in Dover on Boxing Day, but we are keen to establish if they were staying locally. “We have already contacted local hotels but are now asking owners of guesthouses, bed and breakfasts and pubs to contact us if they had a man and woman in their late 50s from Cheshire staying over the Christmas and new year period.” Officers appealed for information from anyone who saw the pair, who were wearing dark wet weather clothing, at the top of the cliffs between Boxing Day and New Year’s Day. Their bodies were spotted by rescue teams as they searched for another man after police were alerted to concern for his welfare on the afternoon of New Year’s Day. The missing man was later discovered dead. The 45-year-old man from Greater Manchester has now been formally identified and his next of kin have been informed, but his name has not been released. A report is being compiled for the coroner. None of the three deaths are being treated as suspicious. The deaths of the brother and sister are not being linked to the death of the first man. The first man’s body was winched by rescue helicopter. The bodies of the man and woman were found later, between half a mile to a mile from his body, said Dover RNLI. A Dover RNLI spokesman said the conditions were quite rough and described the discovery of three bodies so soon into the new year as tragic. The operation involved teams from the Langdon Battery and Deal coastguard stations, Dover RNLI and the Lydd-based UK search-and-rescue helicopter.

It doesn’t matter if their leaderships hail from the right – like Germany’s Social Democrats, currently hovering around 20% in opinion polls – or from the left, like Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour. The scale, the specifics, all differ, but the common theme is crisis. In some countries, such as Greece and Poland, they have all but ceased to exist; towards the better end, Sweden’s Social Democrats cling on in a weak coalition minority government. From dramatic demographic shifts to the rise of nativist populism; from new radical left movements to our model of globalisation; from traditional voters disillusioned with their parties’ embrace of cuts to the rise of civic nationalist movements – well, where do you even begin? Today, the Fabian society has released a sobering (to say the least) report looking at British Labour’s own existential plight. In the often bitterly polarised world of Labour politics, there will be two predictable responses. One is, aha, everything is Corbyn’s fault, if only he rebranded as a self-described “moderate” (whatever that means), Labour would somehow buck the entire trend of European social democracy. The other – from the more uncritical leadership loyalists – is to dismiss the report as enemy propaganda and respond “pah, polling!” (even though, while big polling errors do happen, it is always to Labour’s detriment). Both are mistakes that prevent Labour from addressing its very serious woes. Labour is too big to fail, say the Fabians: that is, the electoral system prevents it from being replaced as the main opposition party. It is, however, extremely unlikely to win a majority whenever the general election takes place, and could even fall to between 140 and 150 seats.. But perhaps the biggest current existential crisis – and there are many – is the legacy of the EU referendum. Labour’s electoral coalition includes both ardent remainers and ardent leavers. The party has already lost four times as many leave voters as remain voters, note the Fabians: underlining why if Owen Smith – who backed a second referendum and refused to rule out joining the euro and the Schengen agreement – had won in September, Labour’s current plight could be even worse. And yet at the same time the party is losing remain supporters to the Liberal Democrats; perhaps even the Greens. Whichever way Labour turns, it risks critical bits of its electoral coalition crumbling away. Hence, paralysis: the party’s position on the defining issue of our time – Brexit – undeniably lacks clarity. Labour has to confront many crises that have nothing to do with Corbyn: Scotland is just one, where Labour’s brittle dominance was smashed away in the aftermath of the referendum. Thanks to medical advances, we live in an ageing population: but with every general election, Labour loses older supporters – the demographic most likely to vote. Unless it reverses this trend, it will never win again, explaining the commendable determination of the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, to defend the triple lock on pensions. Labour’s right are miserable, but their more thoughtful proponents accept they lack strategy, vision or ideas. They have no obvious routemap back to power. They cannot realistically point to a single other country and say – this is what Labour should be doing (unless they wish to emulate the Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau’s electoral victory on the back of pledging to borrow to invest). They can say Corbyn isn’t working but they can’t outline what would work instead. They are intellectually barren and politically lost, and they would be whether Corbyn was leader or not. That is not to ignore the failings of the Labour leadership. Corbyn originally stood for leader out of a sense of duty, to put policies on the agenda. His upper expectations were to win between 20 and 25% of the vote: he won nearly 60% instead, thanks to the ineptitude of his opponents and their lack of vision. The most experienced politician would have struggled against a concerted media offensive and a lack of parliamentary support, let alone a backbench rebel long consigned to the wilderness. The leadership made lots of mistakes that cut through. There was a collective failure of the left (the likes of me included): we have long trapped ourselves in a defensive posture and lacked a clear vision of our own, other than saying “stop!” to policies we didn’t like. Political leadership means saying, here’s what’s wrong with society, here’s what our vision of what society is instead, here’s how we get there. It means hammering at key messages ad infinitum, backed up with policies that are indicative of where the party is coming from. It means speaking in an everyday language that resonates beyond politicos, and having lots to say to the average Briton who is neither poor nor well-off. This has been lacking, and Labour often seems missing from political debate, although some relatively recent appointees (such as Corbyn’s press officer, Matt Zarb-Cousin, and his colleague James Schneider) are determined to change that. Research suggests that voters don’t think Labour is too leftwing, whatever the Labour right argue; they just don’t know what the party stands for. And if you don’t define yourself, you will be defined – mercilessly – by your opponents. Yes, we have a viciously rightwing media, but they are not going to vanish: there just needs to be a sophisticated strategy to deal with them. In today’s fraught political climate, there are some who respond that this critique is only offered because I’m a careerist, secretly rightwing, motivated by money, or part of a Guardian conspiracy against the Labour leadership. In truth, it’s because I want a genuinely radical Labour leadership to succeed: one that invests, rather than cuts; that forces the rich to pay a fair share of tax; that gives workers rights, security, and dignity; that confronts climate change, and treats it as an opportunity to promote the industries and jobs of the future; that brings our services under the ownership of the people of this country; that stops forcing young people to suffer the brunt of a crisis they had nothing to do with; that makes high-quality, affordable housing a basic right for every citizen. However, if Labour loses terribly in an election, the left gets blamed, the party shifts off to the right in response, and the country is even more consumed with rightwing populism, then those things will (to put it bluntly) not happen. The Fabian report has some interesting analysis, but no solutions other than chasing an indecipherable “cultural ‘middle’”.

Analysis by the Change Britain campaign group suggests that hard Brexit, where Britain leaves both the single market and the customs union, could ultimately be beneficial for the UK, citing reports that the US, India, the South American Mercosur group, China, Canada and South Korea have all expressed an interest in trade deals.

But Jonathan Portes, professor of economics and senior fellow at the thinktank UK in a Changing Europe, called the report’s figures “entirely fictional statistics” and said they did not take into account possible risks of leaving the customs union. “Successful free trade deals would increase both exports and imports,” he said. “Calculating, as Change Britain does, a speculative figure for the number of jobs created by additional exports while ignoring the jobs lost as a result of additional imports is either deeply ignorant or deliberately misleading.” Portes said he also believed it was misleading for the report to cite extra benefits including free trade agreements with countries such as South Korea. “The report scores the impact of the EU-Korea FTA as a benefit from Brexit,” he said. “Since this has been in force since 2011 – and would not necessarily continue post-Brexit, although it may well do so – this is a potential cost, not a benefit. Whatever your view on the economics of Brexit, Change Britain are again doing their best to distort the debate.” A Change Britain spokesman said that though the South Korea FTA had been provisionally applied for a number of years, all tariffs only formally disappeared from 2016. “The European commission has said that many benefits would not be clear for at least 10 years – that’s why we are including these benefits in our calculations,” the spokesman said. “We have used the same methodology as used by the EU commission in its papers on the benefits of free trade. This is the very institution that Portes is still campaigning in favour of.” Change Britain’s spokesman said it was “a shame that experts like Portes continue to talk Britain down”. Simon Tilford, the deputy director of the Centre for European Reform thinktank, said Change Britain “seem to assume that leaving the deepest and biggest customs union and free trade agreement in the world, the EU, with which we do half of our trade, will not have any negative economic implications and will not cost employment – that’s an unserious proposition”. Change Britain, which developed out of the official Vote Leave campaign, is chaired by Labour MP and leave supporter Gisela Stuart and has backing from prominent MPs including Michael Gove and Dominic Raab as well as former chancellor Nigel Lawson. The report’s figures are calculated using a European commission study from 2012 that estimated 16,700 jobs would be created for each billion euros of extra-EU exports. “This means that the number of UK jobs that will be created from trade deals with these countries can be calculated by simply dividing 16,700 by the UK’s proportion of extra-EU exports – 14.99% in 2015,” the report says. “This process produces a new figure of 2,503 new UK jobs for each €1bn of extra-EU exports.” Sam Bowman, the executive director of the neoliberal Adam Smith Institute, wrote in a blogpost that the numbers were “basically junk” and said the heavyweight backers of Vote Leave “can do better than this”. “The extra exports figures come from using EU projections about the benefits of trade deals with countries and blocs like India, China and Mercosur, and dividing by Britain’s share of extra-EU trade (15%),” he wrote. “This is fairly misleading, because it assumes that the UK could get the same terms as the EU, which is unlikely, since the UK is a much smaller economic bloc than the EU, so other countries will be less willing to give us what we want to get access to our market. It’s very much back-of-the-fag-packet stuff.” The pro-single market campaign group Open Britain, the continuity arm of Stronger In, called the report “misleading, fantasy figures” that undermined the case for leaving the customs union. The Labour MP Phil Wilson, an Open Britain supporter, said: “The EU helps increase the UK’s global trade links, giving our economy access to over 50 other global markets. We should be looking at ways to protect these benefits, not sacrificing them on the basis of made-up, misleading numbers by anti-EU ideologues.” Open Britain said one key issue was that the report factors in a trade deal with India, which the Indian government has said would be reliant on an increase in student visas, incompatible with Change Britain’s desire to cut migration. Tilford said the UK was likely to find it hard to broker deep free trade agreements with countries such as India unless it was prepared to offer visa liberalisation. “Britain was one of the biggest obstacles to an EU-India free trade agreement and the reasons for that was that the UK did not want to give greater access to Indian IT specialists,” he said. “We’ve left the EU, so why Britain would immediately do a volte-face on that is not clear. Britain alone would have to concede much more to get access to the Indian market.” Announcing the report, the Change Britain founding supporter and former CBI director-general, Lord Jones of Birmingham, said: “The UK has a rich history as a great trading nation. It is therefore no surprise that a number of major economies have already expressed an interest in striking free trade agreements with us. “The only way we can make the most of these huge opportunities is to leave the EU’s customs union and take back control of our trade policy. This will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs in a range of industries right across the UK. We can then take our place as one of the global champions of free trade.” The Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, said Jones was “competing for the Booker prize for fiction” with the report’s conclusions. “Leaving the customs union would at a stroke deny us access to the economies of 50 countries. It would gamble British jobs on foreign trade agreements that are years from being struck,” he said. A Department for International Trade spokesman said: “It’s right to take time to work out the best options for the UK’s trading relationship after we leave the European Union. As we have said before, those decisions have yet to be made.”','https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/03/economists-dispute-claim-that-brexit-could-create-400000-jobs','Economists dispute claim that Brexit could create 400,000 jobs',493,'politics'),('tv-and-radio/2017/jan/03/sherlock-slowly-perversely-morphing-into-james-bond-benedict-cumberbatch','It doesn’t take a sleuth to tell you that Sherlock Holmes is cooler than James Bond. 007 may drink and gamble, but Holmes is the emperor of his own mind palace. Bond may drive an Aston Martin and fight with his fists, but Holmes can captivate a room with nothing more than his words. If you can think at the speed of light, you don’t need a pen that’s also a grenade. So there should be cause for grave concern that the greatest mind in fiction is currently channelling the secret service agent whose main objective is to kill baddies but try not to get the dinner jacket dirty. Meetings must be held and pitchforks held aloft. This cannot stand. The detective at 221B Baker Street has always occupied the natural realm. His capabilities, while breathtaking, are just about comprehensible. Holmes uses science and a phenomenal application of logic to make sense of physical evidence. Unlike Bond, he is just about human enough to remind us of people we have met at parties. He is a nerd, not an action figure; a scientist, not a spy. But, as Sherlock’s stakes have risen, and as the guns and assassins have multiplied, it is starting to feel worryingly like we are watching villains be taken to task by a mutation named Sherlock Bond. Arthur Conan Doyle tells us in his short stories that Holmes has considerable athletic abilities, but chooses to keep these skills – boxing, bartitsu and singlestick – a titillating prospect: a stockinged leg poking out from behind a curtain. Because the most scintillating thing about Holmes is his mind, his displays of physical prowess ought to be rationed. Conan Doyle wanted his protagonist to rise above the cheap thrills of the penny dreadful. Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss should be aware that their protagonist is at risk of suffering the fate Conan Doyle swerved. For a while, there was a clear line between the BBC show and the Guy Ritchie films that took inspiration from the same detective. Ritchie’s films are absurdly, knowingly over-the-top; his Holmes is played by a man who has spent most of his 40s in a red superhero outfit. The only thing anyone remembers about the films is that Robert Downey Jr does some good bare-knuckle boxing – and that at the end of the first film, Holmes doesn’t just fight his adversary, he fights him while wobbling precariously on top of Tower Bridge. Given that they are not based on any of the stories, Ritchie’s films may as well fly free, entirely divorced from the Baker Street detective. They are, as Michael Sragow writes in The New Yorker, camp. When its budgets and audience were smaller, Sherlock could not have been accused of being camp. It mapped out Holmes’ mental machinations with verve and integrity. It was mischievous but loyal to the source material; and, crucially, it felt plausible. The problems with the show, once so surprising and so vital, began in series three, when it had become a phenomenon. A single decision shoulders much of the blame. When Moffat, Gatiss or both decided that Mary Watson just had to be a ninja assassin with a murky past, they took ill-advised liberties with Conan Doyle’s stories in what one can only assume was an attempt to make the programme even sexier. It failed. None of the scenes involving Mary ring true. How can the viewer be expected to believe that both John Watson’s best friend and his wife could be waist-deep in such extraordinarily cool activities? The show began to feel implausible, a fate from which it has never recovered. As the Miss Marple TV series reached the autumn of its years, its writers did not decide that what the character really needed was to pump lead into some bad guys. Poirot would not have been a better show if the moustachioed detective had an assistant who was also a Navy SEAL. There is obviously an audience and an appetite for abseiling assassins, machine-gun shootouts and Benedict Cumberbatch getting sopping wet while kicking ass in an expensive suit – as he does in latest episode The Six Thatchers. But, like the perverse instincts that lurk in the palaces of our minds, this is an appetite that ought to be resisted. Sherlock’s unofficial tagline is “brainy is the new sexy”. It feels like it gave up being brainy a while ago. Soon it may even cease to be sexy. Before you know it, it will have become James Bond.','https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/03/sherlock-slowly-perversely-morphing-into-james-bond-benedict-cumberbatch','Sherlock is slowly and perversely morphing into Bond.

With a weaker pound making exports cheaper, the latest health check shows industry recording its best performance in 30 months. The upbeat mood in UK factories is only partly about the fall in the value of the pound since the EU referendum in June. Firms are also benefiting from solid growth in domestic demand. All manufacturing sectors did well, with the higher output of investment goods helping to dampen fears that firms are cutting back on capital goods ahead of the launch of the UK’s divorce talks with the EU. Order books are strong, suggesting that manufacturing will support growth in the first few months of 2017. A few words of caution are needed though. To be sure, the purchasing managers’ index produced by CIPS/Markit shows manufacturing doing a lot better than forecasters expected at the time of the Brexit vote. But in recent months there has been a disconnect between the upbeat CIPS/Markit surveys and the much more sombre official data. The last set of figures from the Office for National Statistics only cover October, but they showed manufacturing output down by 0.9% on the month and by 0.4% on the year. As a result, manufacturing will need to post an impressive performance in both November and December if it is to contribute to the ONS’s measure of growth for the fourth quarter of 2016. The downside of a depreciating currency is that the boost to exports comes at the expense of dearer imports, and the CIPS/Markit provides evidence of upward price pressures on manufacturing. Two factors will determine whether the resilience of the economy in the second half of 2016 continues into 2017. The first is the extent to which manufacturers and retailers absorb the impact of higher import costs in their profit margins rather than passing on the inflationary impact of a falling pound to consumers. The second is the extent to which exporters break with tradition and take advantage of a more competitive currency by boosting market share rather than raising their prices.','https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/03/uk-factories-may-be-on-a-roll-but-some-words-of-caution-are-needed','UK factories may be on a roll, but some words of caution are needed',495,'business'),('lifeandstyle/2017/jan/03/pasta-with-potatoes-and-smoked-provola-cheese-recipe-rachel-roddy-a-kitchen-in-rome','‘Buon anno, ma meno male che è quasi finita,” said my elderly neighbour yesterday as she wedged the front door of our block open with a bottle of washing detergent – Happy new year, but thank God it is nearly over. She then threw both hands into the air at the sight of the two bins just inside the door, both groaning with bags and boxes (several of them panettone), a plastic tree and the tube of a vacuum cleaner: our very own – slightly stinky – end of the year art installation. People are back at work, but in Rome these are still in-between days bridging New Year and La Festa dell’Epifania, Epiphany, on 6 January, which for children means Befana. On the night of the fifth, children hang stockings and the witch Befana flies in on her broom to bring sweets to those who have been good, and coal to those who have been bad. Being a good housekeeper, she might also use her broom to sweep away the problems of the past year. The same neighbour has been asking Luca if he has been good since before Christmas. He just nods suspiciously. He has, I think, his own ideas about the lady, hunched with age, who lives in the basement. “It is going to rain later,” she said as we stood in the detergent-blocked door looking up at the blue sky, “Dobbiamo prendere un po’ di sole,” which translates as “we must take a bit of sun”, which always makes me think of medicine. A dose of sun or a walk is always a good idea. The oranges are back. Nature’s excellent timing means that Testaccio’s streetwise bitter orange trees are full of blazing fruit in January; joyful and optimistic, if slightly grubby. Optimistic too is the thought that although the light is snuffled away at 4:50pm, sunset will be 4:51pm tomorrow, and 4:52pm the day after. This time of year, with its cold weather and still-short days, its sweeping away and new diaries, creates a selfish and singular appetite which should be listened to. Do you want salad and juice? Have them! Do you want a rib-sticking stew and another glass of red wine? Have them. Or do you want all four? I mean, it’s not as if we need to chose teams. This past week I have, at different moments, wanted oranges, fennel, great piles of greens, pasta e patate and apple crumble and custard – I keep promising myself apple crumble and custard. I have written about pasta e patate before, and I stand by that recipe as a satisfying and beige bowl of goodness. Today’s recipe, however, takes inspiration from a Neapolitan version and is best described as mighty pasta e patate, or as my friend Antonio says pasta e patane. The principle is more or less the same, in that you make simple potato soup in which you cook pasta. However, instead of carrot, the colour in the soffritto comes from tomato. There are slightly more potatoes, a parmesan rind – the imparter of great flavour – and mixed pasta. This recipe is the best reason to start filling a jar with ends of packets and broken bits of pasta. Then instead of a parsimonious dusting of pecorino, you add a great handful of parmesan and some chopped provola cheese, which melts as it hits the hot soup. All this means the final dish is no soft, brothy minestra, but something Italians call azzeccata, a rib-sticking and soulful bowlful that confirms Neapolitans know something about comfort. “I want to eat this forever,” said my son, a string of cheese linking his mouth to his spoon. I understood. On a practical note. Provola is pulled cow’s or buffalo milk cheese, made in a similar way to mozzarella, which is salted, ripened, and occasionally smoked. Cow’s milk scamorza cheese is similar. I think smoked provola or scamorza are particularly good for this recipe, and it is worth seeking them out. If you can’t find either, mozzarella, which melts in similarly stringy way, works, although you might need to add a little more salt. I don’t add pancetta, and don’t miss it. As with all soups or minestre in which you cook pasta, you need to watch and stir so the pasta doesn’t stick, and you may need to add a little more water. This is even more important when there is cheese involved and you are looking for a dense final dish in which a spoon stands to attention. Pasta con patate e provola (pasta with potatoes and smoked provola cheese) Serves 4 1 white onion, peeled and finely diced 1 stick of celery, peeled and finely diced 50g pancetta, diced (optional) 5 tbsp extra virgin olive oil Salt 8 cherry tomatoes, roughly chopped 700g potatoes, peeled and diced 1 litre of water, plus more if necessary A parmesan cheese rind 300g mixed pasta 50g parmesan, grated 150g provola, provola affumicata or smoked cheese, diced 1 In a heavy-based pan, fry the onion, celery and pancetta in the olive oil with a small pinch of salt over a medium-low flame until soft and translucent. 2 Add the tomatoes and potatoes to the pan, stirring until everything glistens with oil. Add a small pinch of salt, plus the water and parmesan rind. Bring to the boil, then reduce to a simmer for 20 minutes, or until the potatoes are soft. 3 Bring the soup back to the boil, add the pasta and cook for 10 minutes or so, or until the pasta is al dente. Add a little more water if the pan looks too dry. Add the parmesan and a little black pepper, taste for salt, stir, then take off the heat. Add the provola, stir and set aside for 5 minutes, then serve. • Rachel Roddy is a food writer based in Rome, the author of Five Quarters: Recipes and Notes from a Kitchen in Rome (Saltyard) and winner of the André Simon food book award','https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jan/03/pasta-with-potatoes-and-smoked-provola-cheese-recipe-rachel-roddy-a-kitchen-in-rome','Rachel Roddy’s recipe for pasta with potatoes and provola cheese | A kitchen in Rome',496,'lifeandstyle'),('society/2017/jan/03/sharp-rise-in-number-of-patients-turned-away-from-ae','The number of patients being turned away from A&amp;E and sent to other hospitals is at a record high, figures show, revealing the huge pressure the NHS faces this winter. More patients arriving by ambulance were redirected to other hospitals this year compared with the same period over the last three years. Such incidents are referred to as diverts. The NHS has previously said that diverts caused by lack of physical or staff capacity should be a last resort. Guardian analysis of NHS England data showed that from 2 to 23 December the number of patients forced to go elsewhere increased by 73% to 95 compared with the previous year, when the number was 55. There were 60 incidences in 2014 and 16 in 2013 – 2012 figures could not be included because of how they were recorded. The rising trend has prompted concern that patients’ health could suffer as a result of the delay to them receiving medical attention due to diverts. The chief executive of the Patients’ Association, Katherine Murphy, said ambulance diversions meant it took longer for patients to get care. “When someone needs access to care they need it. Diverting isn’t an answer to providing a safe system,” she said. Murphy added that there was huge pressure on hospitals now all year around, not just in the winter period. She put this down to the fact that patients often stayed in hospital longer than necessary because of inadequate social service provision. This meant those who needed an acute bed often had to go to another hospital. An NHS England spokesperson said: “Common sense means that ambulances spread the emergency load between neighbouring hospitals, including a very small number of diverts – 19 [in the week before Christmas] compared with an average of 20 a week over the past year. While hospitals are under pressure they have generally been coping with the increased number and severity of winter illnesses.” While the NHS says that there were only 19 in the week leading up to Christmas, there were 36 diverts from 12 to 18 December, with the weekly average up on last year. Dr Mark Porter, the British Medical Association chair of council, said: “Every one of these diverts is a patient unable to get the treatment they need from an overstretched NHS, deprived of resources and failing to keep up with rising demand. Frontline staff are under serious pressure and are working flat out, but the system can’t cope with the number of patients needing to move through acute care, as it is congested. “We can only get to grips with pressure on A&amp;E if every part of the system – from general practice to social care – is adequately funded, supported and working well.” In October the performance of hospitals against the crucial target of 95% of A&amp;E patients being treated and either admitted, discharged or transferred within four hours was the fourth worst since records began. The NHS is on track to have its most difficult winter ever. A total of 785,883 patients – up from 613,971 last year – could end up waiting more than the supposed maximum four hours for A&amp;E care in the December to February months. This is based on a 28% year-on-year rise in such delays seen each year between 2010-11 and 2015-16, according to Incisive Health, a specialist health communications and policy firm. Meanwhile, the number of cases of norovirus is at a five-year high. Data from Public Health England shows the bug had reached 2,435 this season, 12% more than the average for the same period over the last five years. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said A&amp;Es up and down the country were under pressure. “Not only do we now know the scale of diverts, we also know that over recent months hundreds of thousands of patients have been forced to wait longer than four hours in A&amp;Es. As well as this, more and more patients are increasingly waiting on trolleys.”','https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jan/03/sharp-rise-in-number-of-patients-turned-away-from-ae','Sharp rise in number of patients turned away from A&E',497,'society'),('world/2017/jan/03/turkey-sets-out-terms-for-co-operation-with-trump-us-administration','Turkey has set out its terms for cooperation with Donald Trump, saying it expects the new US administration to halt the supply of weapons to Syrian Kurdish forces – which Washington has denied it is doing. “The United States should not allow this strategic partnership [with Turkey] to be overshadowed by a terrorist organisation,” Binali Yıldırım, the Turkish prime minister, said in a speech in parliament. Washington sees the Kurdish YPG militia, the largest element of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), as one of the most effective partners in the fight against Islamic State in Syria. The US president-elect has yet to set out his position on how best to defeat Isis and whether he considers the Kurds an ally. US officials confirmed in September that they were supplying light weapons to the SDF, but said they were only going to its Arab contingent. This week Washington again insisted it had not supplied weapons to the YPG. But Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, said his government had documents to prove the supply, adding: “Everyone in the world knows it.” Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has previously said he has seen evidence of US planes carrying arms landing at the Kurdish-controlled town of Kobani. Turkey regards the YPG as a terrorist group and indistinguishable from the Kurdish militants in Turkey who have been waging a 30-year war for independence. Kurdish officials linked to the YPG said they had been promised the US would arm them directly if they led the battle for Isis’s Syrian stronghold in Raqqa. On Monday Syrian rebel groups announced they had decided to freeze any talks about their possible participation in Syrian peace negotiations being prepared by Russia in Kazakhstan unless the Syrian government and its Iran-backed allies ended what it said were violations of a ceasefire. The rebel groups said the Syrian army and its allies had repeatedly violated the ceasefire in Wadi Barada valley and the eastern Guta region near Damascus, as well as in Hama and Dara’a provinces. The Syrian government claims it was attacking only the positions of Isis and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (formerly the al-Nusra Front), two groups that are not party to the ceasefire. The argument underlines the difficulty of enforcing a ceasefire when groups party to it are physically close to groups that are excluded. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said government forces were attacking with helicopters and artillery fire after advancing on Monday to the outskirts of the Ain al-Fijah spring, the main water source in the area, including for Damascus. Syria’s government accuses rebels in Wadi Barada of deliberately targeting infrastructure there, causing fuel to poison the water supply and then cutting the flow to Damascus altogether.','https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/03/turkey-sets-out-terms-for-co-operation-with-trump-us-administration','Turkey urges Trump administration to turn back on Syrian Kurdish forces',498,'world'),('environment/2017/jan/03/cornish-village-delabole-25-years-of-uk-wind-power','From Pam the lollipop lady to the repairs for a storm-battered church roof, the fruits of wind power are not hard to find in Delabole. The residents of this Cornish village have lived alongside the UK’s first commercial windfarm since it was built in the year the Gulf war ended and Ryan Giggs rose to fame. The Delabole windfarm marked its 25th anniversary in December, having produced enough power to boil 3.4bn kettles since the blades began spinning. Peter Edwards, a local farmer, erected the first turbines after going on an anti-nuclear march with his wife, Pip. “They thought ‘if not nuclear’, then what do we build?” said Juliet Davenport, CEO of Good Energy, the utility that bought the farm from the family in 2002. Since there was effectively no wind industry in the UK in 1991, Peter went on an exploratory mission to Denmark, which had by then become a world leader in wind power, spurred by the oil crises of the 1970s. With the help of local people, local authorities and utilities, he raised about £10m to fund the first 10 turbines, which were each rated at 0.4 megawatts (MW) of capacity. Today, renewable energy accounts for a quarter of the UK’s electricity generation, and the biggest turbines are rated at approximately 8MW. “After the windfarm started generating in 1991, one of the main criticisms was that the amount we contributed to the National Grid was so insignificant that we shouldn’t have bothered,” said Edwards. “That’s why it’s so satisfying to see just how far wind energy has come and how it now competes with nuclear.” While locals acknowledge there are some people in the village who don’t like the windfarm, many are vocal supporters of a technology that in some parts of the UK has become so politically toxic the Conservatives effectively banned it by pulling subsidies when they came to power in 2015. “It’s definitely positive. I stood up for it for years ago when I was parish councillor,” said Tricia Hicks, who is now retired and runs a volunteer hospital car service in the village where she has lived for 40 years. “It’s been brilliant for Delabole: we’ve not had power cuts; they’ve given money for repairing the church roof after storm damage, for playgrounds; they’ve put a load into the village. You’ll get the few [who are negative]. They’re in the minority.” The windfarm is also a draw for passersby. Delabole residents Susan and John Theobald said: “We’ve always enjoyed being around the turbines and have often walked right up to them with our dogs. It’s always lovely – still to this day – to see so many people taking photos of the site.” The area, as Hicks and others point out, has always been a mixture of natural beauty and industry. Next door is the country’s biggest slate quarry, where more than 10m tonnes of the rock have been mined over the last millennium. Some of the goodwill for the windfarm is financially driven. Householders in Delabole, which has held on to a pub, primary school, two churches and a Spar, can sign up for a special tariff with Good Energy, and enjoy lower electricity bills on windy years via a windfall. The company also provides a local fund of £10,000 a year, which has helped pay for everything from the local football and cricket team to a community newsletter produced by volunteers. The local tariff was one of the fruits of door-to-door discussions in 2010, when it made economic sense for Good Energy to “repower” the site by taking down the old turbines and replacing them with four new ones. With the turbines twice the height and much more powerful at 2.3MW each, the new windfarm produces more than double the power of the old one, enough for about 6,200 homes. “The major difference with the turbines is the size,” said Davenport, of how the technology has changed. “The ones we’ve put on there are gearbox-less. It reduces the noise – with the bigger turbines, the key noise you hear is the blades, but the older ones you heard the gearbox as well.” Aerodynamics of modern turbines have improved too, while costs have “come down significantly”, said Davenport. “But really it’s about getting more power from the same land area.” For now, wind power’s expansion from this corner of Cornwall to more than a 1,000 onshore wind projects across the UK is halted. Ministers have made clear they will only support windfarms at sea. “I can’t see onshore wind being positively supported by this government,” said Davenport. But Delabole’s story as a pioneer is not necessarily over. Next on Davenport’s wishlist for the site is a solar farm, and an energy storage plant, a technology many believe will be key for renewable energy’s next big breakthrough.','https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jan/03/cornish-village-delabole-25-years-of-uk-wind-power','Cornish village marks 25 years of UK wind power',499,'environment'),('books/2017/jan/03/milo-yiannopoulos-250000-book-deal-fury-leslie-jones-simon-schuster-breitbart-alt-right','Comedian Leslie Jones has spoken out against Simon &amp; Schuster’s decision to publish a book by outspoken “alt-right” figure Milo Yiannopoulos, months after he was banned from Twitter for allegedly encouraging a bombardment of abusive tweets towards the Ghostbusters actor. It was announced last week that Yiannopoulos, an editor for Breitbart News, had signed a $250,000 (£203,000) contract with Threshold, a conservative imprint of publisher Simon &amp; Schuster, after he was offered – in his words – “a wheelbarrow full of money”. Threshold has previously printed books by Donald Trump, Dick Cheney and Rush Limbaugh. The news sparked outrage among those who say he should not have a platform to share his views. After a coordinated appeal began on 29 December, with instructions on how to call the publisher and individual agents being shared widely online, Simon &amp; Schuster briefly responded to the backlash, asking critics to “withhold judgment until they have had a chance to read the actual contents of the book”. It later issued a longer statement, saying it does not and never has condoned discrimination or hate speech in any form, that it had “always published books by a wide range of authors with greatly varying, and frequently controversial opinions”, and that “while we are cognisant that many may disagree vehemently with the books we publish we note that the opinions expressed therein belong to our authors, and do not reflect either a corporate viewpoint or the views of our employees”. Jones, who almost left Twitter after the abuse until the CEO of the social media platform, Jack Dorsey personally intervened, accused Simon &amp; Schuster of helping the likes of Yiannopoulos “spread their hate”. By 30 December the book, entitled Dangerous, was already No 2 on Amazon’s overall bestseller list and the No 1 in the site’s political commentary and opinion category, despite not being scheduled to arrive until March. Authors and industry bodies have denounced Simon &amp; Schuster for making the deal. The Chicago Review of Books announced it would not be reviewing any Simon &amp; Schuster books in 2017 – the company publishes about 2,000 books a year across its 35 imprints. Author Karen Hunter, who is published by Simon &amp; Schuster, tweeted that she’s “rethinking my relationship” with the company, while fellow Simon &amp; Schuster author Danielle Henderson wrote: “I have calls in with my editor, agent and lawyer. This is too personal for me to ignore.” She later explained that the publisher had paid a large advance for her forthcoming book The Ugly Cry but that she would be happy to find another publisher if it did go on to put out Yiannopoulos’s book. Jones’s colleagues in Hollywood also spoke out. Comedian Sarah Silverman tweeted: “The guy has freedom of speech but to fund him &amp; give him a platform tells me a LOT about @simonschuster YUCK AND BOO AND GROSS”, while director Judd Apatow tweeted: “In these times we can not let hatemongers get rich off of their cruelty. Shame on @simonschuster!” A conservative who led the Gays for Trump movement during the 2016 US elections, Greek-born Brit Yiannopoulos has labelled transgender people as “mentally ill”, called feminism “cancer” and said the Black Lives Matter movement is a “hate group”. He was also a leading figure in the Gamergate controversy. Yiannopoulos has announced books twice before that never materialised: one on Gamergate, which he announced in December 2014, and one called The Sociopaths of Silicon Valley, in January 2015.','https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jan/03/milo-yiannopoulos-250000-book-deal-fury-leslie-jones-simon-schuster-breitbart-alt-right','Leslie Jones accuses Simon & Schuster over Milo Yiannopoulos book deal',500,'books');

INSERT INTO `categories` VALUES (1,'Ringed by golden beaches and temperate Pacific seas, Kaitaia is unconscionably pretty, dotted with flaming red pohutukawa trees and blessed by year-round blue skies. The town of 5,000 people on the northern tip of New Zealands North Island should be known as a holiday resort, but instead it has been dubbed the murder capital of New Zealand after four homicides and six suicides in a single year. It is like the town has become haunted, says Nina Griffiths, 18, who lost two friends to suicide this year. People say you have to get out of Kaitaia, you have to get out of this shithole. There is a sense of hopelessness if you stay here ... we dont feel like our lives are valued enough to put effort in to save them, and make sure this never happens again. Kaitaia is the last major stop on state highway one in the far north; 300km from Auckland or a $150 plane ticket out. Half the town earn less than NZ$20,000 a year, and 60% are Maori, with unemployment at more than double the national average. While it is pretty, the town is also remote, poor and increasingly stigmatised as the place dreams go to die. We are a community that feels doomed, said He Korowai trust chief executive Ricky Houghton in October, still reeling from the suicide of his nephew, and four other young men aged under 25. If these deaths happened anywhere else in New Zealand it would be front-page news - a crisis. But because its Kaitaia were forgotten, no one cares what happens to us. People think there is no future for the people here. Senior leaders openly acknowledge that Kaitaia has a range of entrenched and long-standing social problems, including a lack of viable employment, isolation and strong gang and drug links. But they also say 2016s glut of deaths may finally prove a turning point for their forgotten town  that the deaths have spurred a formerly broken community to unite and stick up for itself in a way they havent seen in decades. Earlier this year, Kaitaia fire chief Colin Kitchen considered quitting his job after attending two hangings and a stabbing homicide in a 24-hour-period. Our town has been knocked for sure, were still in shock. When it happens once or twice, well sadly that is expected, but when it keeps happening you think what the hell is going on here? I did feel at one point that I would have to walk away from it, that Id had enough, says Kitchen, who has been with the fire brigade for more than four decades. But if we stepped away from it, who would look after our community, and what kind of message would that send, if the leaders desert? I think this year has been so bad its been a wake-up call, and I am finally starting to see things turn around. The town is getting stronger and regrouping. By August six people killed by their own hand had passed through the Kaitaia morgue. With some of the strictest guidelines in the world for the media reporting on suicides, the slew of sudden deaths fuelled Kaitaias reputation as the murder capital of New Zealand, and rumours in town twisted and warped, with some hearing as many as 15 people had died. Griffiths was feeling sick to the guts. Traumatised by the futility of her friends lives so bluntly ended, but also frustrated by the communitys initial response  which she describes as muted and repressed, with people referring to the deaths as passings instead of suicides and murders. Griffiths felt Kaitaia  and young people especially  had two options: implode, or change, fast. This town is so small everyone was affected by the deaths, literally everyone, says Griffiths, who has received a NZ$10,000 AMP scholarship to set up a youth space in town, intended as a retreat for vulnerable kids. People are always asking me when we go away for sports events and stuff  oh so youre from the murder capital. And that doesnt help us feel better about ourselves, or our town. It makes us feel really embarrassed of where we live and this past year there has not been a lot of pride around here. In July Griffiths contacted comedian and mental health advocate Mike King, begging him to travel north and facilitate a straight-up conversation about suicide in Kaitaia. Suicide professionals tried to dissuade her, as they had attempted to dissuade King when he visited in 2013, saying discussing the deaths in a public forum could inspire copycats or stir up emotions. But Griffiths ignored their warnings and went ahead with the meeting  attended by hundreds  all desperately seeking guidance from King on how to stem the flow of young lives. King and Griffiths say most of the suicide prevention teams in Kaitaia refused to attend. I know for a fact that Nina got a lot of flak for organising the meetings, and told she was a silly little girl who didnt know what she was doing, says King. But she was absolutely right, her approach is backed up by the latest research, that talking about suicide is what communities need to do. There are a lot of young people up there who feel like no one cares about them, and no one loves them, they feel hopeless. Until that is addressed and brought into the light, the stats will continue to rise. Griffithss determination to face the deaths head-on may have inspired others to reject the mounting negativity surrounding their town, and since August a small but perceptible change has begun, with no more homicides or suicides recorded. The Facebook group I love Kaitaia has hundreds of members, and bumper stickers and T-shirts with the slogan are worn proudly by the towns residents. Musicians have written songs extolling the virtues of their Far North paradise, and trees have been strung with streamers; the once-weed strewn garden beds planted with red and pink geraniums. Formal and informal mentoring and guardian relationships are also tentatively being broached. In a coup for the town, last week the Warriors rugby league team flew in on the royal air force DC3 for a three-day visit, with the sole mission of lifting morale. Being dubbed the murder capital made people really angry, and they wanted to fight back, because we love our home, Griffiths says. We dont want to be defined by death. In New Zealand, crisis helplines can be found here. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. Hotlines in other countries can be found here.','entertainment'),(2,'A plane carrying 35 Russian diplomats, expelled from the United States over Moscows alleged interference in the presidential election, took off from Washington on Sunday, Russian news agencies reported. The plane has taken off. Everyone is on board, said the Russian embassy in Washington, quoted by the state-owned Ria Novosti agency. Relatives of the diplomats were also on board, making 96 in all. The expulsions were part of a package of sanctions ordered by President Barack Obama on Thursday. US intelligence says the Kremlin ordered a hack-and-release of emails from within the Democratic party and Hillary Clintons campaign in an effort to put Donald Trump in the Oval Office. Moscow has denied the allegations. Thirty-five Russians, described as intelligence operatives based at the Russian embassy in Washington and the consulate in San Francisco, were given 72 hours to leave the country. Obama also ordered the closure of two Russian compounds in New York and Maryland that the US says are used for intelligence-related purposes. Economic sanctions were also announced against Russias FSB and GRU intelligence agencies. President Vladimir Putin has ruled out sending home US diplomats in retaliation  a move interpreted as a sign that he is looking to Trump to rebuild US-Russian ties after his inauguration on 20 January. On Saturday, Donald Trump again expressed his scepticism over whether Russia was responsible for the computer hacks. In remarks to reporters upon entering a New Years Eve celebration at his Mar-a-Lago estate on Saturday night, Trump warned against being quick to pin the blame on Russia. I just want them to be sure, because its a pretty serious charge, he said. And if you look at the weapons of mass destruction, that was a disaster, and they were wrong. US intelligence officials have said that they are confident Russia was behind the US election hacks , which could have played a role in Trumps defeat over Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The Washington Post also reported on Friday that Moscow could be behind malware found on a laptop owned by a Vermont electricity utility. In response to that discovery, Vermont governor Peter Shumlin said: One of the worlds leading thugs, Vladimir Putin, has been attempting to hack our electric grid, which we rely upon to support our quality of life, economy, health, and safety. At Mar-a-Lago, Trump said: I think its unfair if we dont know. It could be somebody else. I also know things that other people dont know, so we cannot be sure. Asked what that information included, the president-elect said: You will find out on Tuesday or Wednesday. He did not elaborate, although in a statement released on Thursday in response to Obamas sanctions, he said he would meet intelligence officials.','business'),(3,'Its been a rollercoaster of a year. In the world of sustainability alone, we saw the landmark Paris climate change agreement come into force; learned how rising temperatures in the Arctic are negatively impacting local residents; and watched as the worlds top conservationists mourned the declining state of Australias Great Barrier Reef. And then, a bombshell: a certain short-fingered vulgarian won the US presidential race and called into question everything from Americas basic environmental protection to Nasas ongoing climate change research. Corporate America took evasive action, signing a letter telling Donald Trump it is serious about sustainability, while others began unpacking Trumps emphasis on clean coal and what it really means for the future of energy in the US. But it hasnt all been doom and gloom. While the rest of the world struggled to come to terms with the aforementioned craziness, innovators, scientists and tech heads worked quietly from the sidelines to come up with solutions. And some succeeded: from a trashcan that sucks up ocean garbage to a drone that delivers vaccines to endangered ferrets, here are our top picks for this years best sustainable tech. A trashcan for the ocean Its no secret that our oceans are turning into swirling garbage dumps. There are some 5.25tn pieces of floating plastic debris in the oceans right now, and its estimated that some 8m metric tons of plastic waste enter global waters every year. Earlier this year, Peter Ceglinski and Andrew Turton, two surfers from Australia, came up with a device theyre calling the Seabin  a kind of submersible garbage can that captures floating trash. Picture a cylinder, with the upper opening just below the surface of the water. An electric pump draws water through the bottom of the cylinder, creating a vortex around the upper edge that pulls in water and floating trash. A bag filter, made of natural material, collects the trash and allows water to pass through. After raising more than $267,000 in an Indiegogo campaign to help build the device, Ceglinski and Turton are keen to start selling the Seabin to marinas around the world. First stop: Miami, Florida, where Miami Beachs marinas manager wants to start using the Seabin in 2017 to counter the bags, bottles, paper plates and forks found daily in the water. A handheld cancer-detecting device Earlier this year, British-based tech firm QuantuMDx developed a new, low-cost diagnostic DNA analyzer the size of a smartphone which is being billed as a handheld lab. The device  called Q-Poc  can accurately diagnose everything from cancers to infectious diseases in minutes. Although it is currently in alpha testing stage, the company hopes to get the product in the hands of doctors by early 2018. Q-Poc runs on a solar-powered battery and its designed to read biological samples submitted via a credit card-size cartridge. It can work with a range of sample types: swabs can be used to detect sexually-transmitted infections, while saliva is used to detect tuberculosis. (Tests for other diseases will be added at a later date.) The device uses mobile technology, enabling the test results to be geo-stamped and shared in real time. The prospect of a speedy diagnosis at a patients side is exciting, particularly in countries where access to medical care is a challenge. Subject to regulatory approval by the World Health Organization (WHO), QuantuMDx hopes to initially roll out the Q-Poc unit in South Africa, before expanding to other markets. Stuff you can eat (instead of throwing it away) It was a big year for edible everyday items, like cutlery and beer cans. First up, an Indian cutlery company, Bakeys, invented cutlery that you can eat as a way to tackle plastic waste in oceans and landfill. (Welcome to a new geological epoch of trash  scientists are calling it the manmade Anthropocene.) Plastic cutlery significantly contributes to this problem  estimates suggest the US alone uses 40bn plastic utensils a year. Hence the need for edible versions. Bakeys makes vegan-friendly cutlery from rice, wheat and an ancient grain called sorghum, which was picked because it doesnt go soggy when immersed in liquid. The cutlery comes in three flavors: savory (salt and cumin); sweet (sugar); and plain. And, if youre wondering  it kind of tastes like a dry cracker. Why not wash down the cutlery with an edible beer holder? Americans are consuming more beer it seems  67bn beer cans each year, apparently. According to the Brewers Association, this number is expected to grow significantly as craft breweries get more popular. The problem is that plastic beer can holders pose a threat to fish and marine wildlife when they end up in the ocean. Saltwater Brewery, based in Florida, has come up with a solution: biodegradable, edible beer pack rings made from wheat and barley waste. The rings disintegrate within two hours of being in the ocean, which prevents fish or other sea animals getting stuck. Theyre also harmless if ingested by curious fish. More than 50 craft breweries have already contacted Saltwater expressing an interest in using the edible rings. The brewery is now developing metal molds capable of making 400,000 rings per month and hopes to build a centralized production facility by 2017. A drone that helps endangered species One of 2016s most heartwarming stories revolved around a cunning plan by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) to bombard a ferret habitat in Montana with a vaccine administered via specially designed drones that can shoot pellets in three directions at the same time. All this in a bid to save the endangered black-footed ferret. The vaccine pellets are actually intended for the prairie dog population inside the habitat at the UL Bend National Wildlife Refuge. The ferrets are dependent upon prairie dogs for food and shelter, but a flea-borne disease called sylvatic plague has slowly been killing the prairie dogs off. The FWS came up with a glorified gumball machine to spit out the vaccine pellets. The machine which can be attached to a drone which uses GPS to drop the pellets throughout the habitat. Oh, and if youre wondering: the FWS said lab tests show that prairie dogs find the bait in the vaccines delicious. Using 3D printers to eliminate plastic waste As weve established, humans produce a lot of trash  apparently of the more than 300m tons of plastic produced globally every year, one refuse trucks worth ends up in our waters, landfills and streets every minute. One of our favorite stories this year came from India, where a local entrepreneur has set up a production facility at a local rubbish dump, where waste pickers convert high-density polyethylene (HPDE)  mostly used for plastic bottles  into 3D printing filament to eventually be sold to 3D printing companies. The market for 3D printing filament  the majority of which is made from virgin plastic  is growing rapidly. A recent report predicted the 3D printing materials market will grow by nearly 266% in the next five years. And, while the market for ethical filament is still relatively small, the greatest potential 3D printing seems to be offering the developing world is employment  there are an estimated 15 million people globally who currently make their living from waste picking, for example.','business'),(4,'Sam Allardyce, after winning one point from his first two games in charge of Crystal Palace, has called for the Premier League fixture organiser to be sacked. The former England manager, who left his position with the national team after only one match following an undercover newspaper investigation, is now pointing the finger at fixture congestion. Yohan Cabaye, Christian Benteke and Andros Townsend were all substituted by Allardyce with Palace losing 2-0 at Arsenal on Sunday afternoon as the manager began to turn his attention to Tuesdays home game with the bottom side Swansea City. Weve been dealt the blow of not having enough recovery time between now and Tuesday night, why cant we play Wednesday? asked Allardyce. I dont know who does the fixtures but he needs sacking really. Swansea played yesterday, have 24 hours on us. Theyre such big games with so much at stake, you want a fair crack at it, and its unfair when youre playing [Sunday] and Tuesday night. I was disappointed in our first-half performance [against Arsenal]. We gave much too good possession away. None more so than the [Giroud] goal. That was simple possession given away on one of our attacks in the first half. It was a brilliant piece of skill, how he took the goal, but our passing wasnt good enough. Allardyce is now looking to the transfer window to help out his Palace squad. Two things [need] to happen for the team to get better and produce more results: get the team fitter and buy players in. Two if possible, three if the finances will allow, he said. I want to lift the squad. It lifted the whole place last year at Sunderland.','sport'),(5,'Pep Guardiola wished the assembled media a happy new year at the start of his post-match press conference and extended the seasonal goodwill message to their families when he left the Anfield stage. It was a nice touch by the Manchester City manager but the niceties were part of a performance better than that produced by his team at Liverpool and exposed by an angry, exasperated exchange with Txiki Begiristain shortly afterwards. There was no goodwill to be found in defeat by Jrgen Klopp and falling 10 points adrift of Chelsea, the leaders. Press duties completed, Guardiola headed back to the makeshift dressing rooms in the bowels of Anfields new main stand where he met Begiristain, Citys director of football and a man with some serious questions to answer over the clubs expensive and erratic recruitment drive. Guardiola, pacing up and down, scratched his head, pulled at his tie and began punching his fist into the palm of his hand as he dissected Citys display with his former Barcelona colleague. They have trailed and recovered before but that was at a club attuned to Guardiolas methods and vice-versa. A revealing glimpse into genuine frustration and the performance that provoked it were reminders of how much work is required to recreate that understanding at the Etihad Stadium. The manager was angry at halftime, Yaya Tour admitted. When you are losing like that and Liverpool are the better side then its not going to be happy at half-time. It was disappointing and we all felt that. Of course he is going to be angry. He is a manager who can be angry. We have to sometimes improve and react to situations, and of course we knew Liverpool would be waiting when we lost the ball and they did that to score. So he will be angry for everything that is happening. We are not going to be perfect. There are times when we wont take opportunities but we can take opportunities from this too. Anfield is not easy but we can learn from this and what the manager says about it. When you lose games, what do you have to do? You are disappointed and you want to bounce back. We dont want to let the gap grow much more between us and Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham. So we have to react. We will use it  we are not going to give up. We will go to the&nbsp;end. Tour and co responded to their managers criticism, controlling possession in the second half and forcing Liverpool into a retreat when David Silva switched to the centre in place of the subdued Kevin De Bruyne, but not to the extent of creating one chance of note. Klopps team were restricted as an attacking threat, too, but having punished Citys weakness in the air early, when Georginio Wijnaldum produced an outstanding leap and header to convert Adam Lallanas eighth-minute cross, their compact shape held firm. The Liverpool manager had bemoaned the freedom with which Joe Allen roamed between his midfield and defence in their previous outing, against Stoke City. He ensured there was no repeat against Manchester City with a more protective midfield trio of Wijnaldum, Jordan Henderson and Emre Can. Raheem Sterling, fading amid the hostility that greeted his latest return to Anfield, De Bruyne, Silva, in the first half, and Sergio Agero, throughout his first appearance in 28 days, were comprehensively shackled. Klopp had the answers to Citys array of individual talents. His team have collected 13 points from 18 while Philippe Coutinho has been injured and, as the Brazilian nears fitness, so Liverpool have emerged as formidable challengers to Chelsea. Klopp said it must be annoying for Antonio Contes team to have won 13 consecutive league games and still found Liverpool hanging on six points behind. Equally, how annoying must it be to have won 12 of the last 16 league games and sit second? We came from eighth position last year so we dont think about being champion or whatever this year, but we are much better than last year and the position is completely different, said Klopp. We are fine. If anyone else thought we had to be champion this year then maybe it seems different to them but we are fine. We are where we are and if it ends there then cool. If we are still there five matches before the end and are only a few points behind then we will think about something else but not in this moment. Im not like this. I have had much more difficult situations in my life than being second in a very difficult league. We are happy about our way and what the rest is doing we can have no influence on until we play them. Thats all we can do. Im not annoyed. Not for one second. I won a league twice and I honestly didnt think about the opportunity until really late. We have targets. We are ambitious. You saw it again against City how ambitious the boys are but talking about it doesnt bring you one point. You have to work. When you see the final line and if you are still in and around then the pressure will increase. You could see the pressure here  not because we didnt want to lose the game but because we wanted to win it. That is really pressure against a very good side. You do the analysis and think: Oh my God, I dont want to show the boys all of this because they are a really good side. I know there is criticism of their defending or whatever but they play some of the best football in the world and you have to defend it. We did it. Im happy with our situation in the table at the moment. Klopp can be content not only with Liverpools league position but how his team have developed rapidly according to his managerial ideals. Guardiola, between the new year wishes, admitted he is unsure when City will do likewise. I dont know, Im not able to tell you that, he said. Jrgen is here more than one season, more than one year. Ive been here just six months and the way we want to play in the league is not that simple. We need a little bit more time but Im a guy who is so optimistic and were going to try.','sport'),(6,'Zlatan Ibrahimovic believes his 17 goals for Manchester United have made his doubters eat their balls and that Jos Mourinhos side can still win the title. Saturdays 2-1 victory against Middlesbrough at Old Trafford was a fifth straight league win and takes United to 36 points, 13 behind the leaders, Chelsea, as they travel to West Ham United for Mondays late afternoon kick-off. United needed goals from Anthony Martial and Paul Pogba on 85 and 86 minutes to overcome Grant Leadbitters strike with a quarter of the game to go but the home side felt they should have been ahead before half-time. Ibrahimovich had what appeared a legitimate finish struck off by the referee, Lee Mason, for his collision with Vctor Valds despite this clearly occurring after the No9 made contact with the ball. The finish would have taken the Swede to 51 goals in 2016, level with Lionel Messis highest mark for the calendar year. Yet Ibrahimovic was content with the three points and in his own particular fashion took personal satisfaction from the stellar start to his United career after his summer move from Paris Saint-Germain. I had a fantastic year, I am not complaining. I came to United, my first six months here has been more than amazing. I am super happy and lets hope we can continue the ride and keep going. I feel good. I dont know how many years I have left but I am enjoying the football. I came to the Premier League and everyone thought it would not be possible but like always I make them eat their balls. Asked to explain this, the 35-year-old said: It gives me a lot of energy, trust me. A lot of energy because they get paid to talk shit and I get paid to play with my feet, thats how I enjoy it. United are trying for a sixth consecutive league victory for the first time in two seasons. Ibrahimovich said of their form: With every game you win, you get confidence. We havent lost for the last 10 games [actually 12], and it was important to win against Middlesbrough. We had to work hard for the win and the important thing is the three points because we want to come closer to the top and we are losing 1-0 and we should have had the goal, I scored. Why he whistled, I dont know. At first he gave the goal and after 30 seconds, he changed his mind. There was not a lot to speak to him because if you open your mouth, they give you a yellow and I was like: Listen, you just took a goal from me, and now you want to give me a yellow card. OK, we keep playing and conceded a goal, it was easy for them and after we were working and then it was 1-1, and 2-1 within a minute. That was not important  to level with Messi. The important thing was to win. For me the win is the same if I would beat Messi or not. Hopefully we can still win the league. We had our dips and we were winning and losing and winning and losing and hopefully the other teams can do some mistakes and we can close the gap closer and come into the top four. Ibrahimovic has never played two matches in 48 hours, as he will do when lining up at West Ham, with Mourinho confirming he will start there. Its crazy, said the centre-forward. There is no superman, there is no strength that can recover from a game so fast and I cannot do nothing about it. If the coach wants me to play, I will play. But lets be realistic, from a game you need to recover two or three days. A happy Mourinho said: Zlatans disappointed because in this moment he should be celebrating being top scorer in 2016. He did it. But he will start on Monday. You can tell [Slaven] Bilic that. West Ham are 12th with 22 points after Saturdays 1-0 defeat at Leicester City, who visit a Middlesbrough side four points above the drop zone on Monday. Leadbitter said: We have a little league table that we want to finish top of, and that has to be our priority this season. One of the teams in that league is coming up on Monday at home and we have to look forward.','sport'),(7,'Shortly after the final whistle blew at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, Antonio Conte and Diego Costa could be seen walking back towards the tunnel together. Manager appeared to be sharing a joke with player, one he declined to expand on later, but their body language said it all. Smiles, a warm embrace, mutual bonhomie, and with regard to Costa the concrete sense that he is entering 2017 in a far happier mood than he did 2016. This time last year the forward was in the midst of a personal crisis, having scored just six times for a Chelsea side making a mockery of their status as league champions, and was spending more time picking fights with opposition players than terrorising them with his talents. Now he is the key figure of the team that sit six points clear at the top of the Premier League on the back of a recordequalling 13-game winning run. Costa has 14 goals, making him the divisions top scorer, with his latest against Stoke City typifying the 28yearold at his barnstorming, ruthless best, the man who spearheaded Chelseas title success of 2014-15 and appears ready to do so again. The team has changed, not just me, he said. Last season we felt a frustration. We didnt give the account of ourselves we should have done. We werent the team we should be. I wasnt the player I should be. There were various issues but this season it has changed. The manager has come and applied his ideas. Things are going well. Of that there is no doubt. Conte has revitalised Chelsea, tactically and in terms of their spirit, which could be seen at the weekend in what the Italian described as the toughest challenge his team have faced during their winning sequence. Stoke played with aggression and assurance and twice pegged back the hosts. But those in blue kept on believing, kept on driving forward, and eventually triumphed 4-2. It was fitting that Costa sealed the three points with the fourth goal, having delivered another fine front-man display. He was a constant menace and did not react to the rugged manner in which those in the visitors ranks, Ryan Shawcross in particular, looked to keep him at bay. Last season Costa would have lashed out  or accused Shawcross of smelling rotten, as he did when the pair clashed at the Britannia Stadium 14 months ago  but here he kept his calm, something he says is the result of accepting referees in this country are against me and: If theyre not going to change, I had to change. Eyebrows may well be raised at that statement and its worth noting that for all his changes, Costa has already served a one-match suspension this season. But he definitely seems calmer and he delivered the perfect response to Stokes attentions with a vicious strike past Lee Grant on 85 minutes having floored Bruno Martins Indi with brute strength and persistence. Costa has now been involved in 19 goals this season  more than any other player across Europes top five divisions. Things are coming out well for me this season, he said. The truth is that the manager is good with the players, every time making jokes and thats good for us, to have a manager who is not just a boss but a person we can talk to, someone whose support we can count on. We love him more all the time. That love is clearly mutual  Conte describes Costa as an important player, and Chelsea fans may well shudder upon being reminded that the pair came close to not working together at Stamford Bridge. Yes, yes, I was about to leave [in the summer], said Costa. I had the possibility of going back to Atltico [Madrid] because of a few things; the family, the life I have there. I wanted to change for family reasons but, well, it wasnt to be and I continue to be happy here. It was important that the manager from the very first minute said he counted on me. Costas importance to Chelsea can be further seen in the fact his 14 league goals have come in 13 games. He has failed to score in only seven appearances in all competitions, and in only three of those did he complete 90 minutes. When Costa has played this season, he has tended to score. It should come as no surprise, then, that he is the latest figure to be linked with a move to China, with reports on Sunday claiming that Tianjin Quanjian are planning to make an 80m bid for the Brazil-born Spain international. Despite the size of the fee, it seems inconceivable Chelsea would sanction the move, and for Costa there must surely be the desire to see out a campaign in which he is on course to secure another Premier League winners medal and be named player of the year. As he said himself: I am very happy, very content. Chelseas collective focus now turns to visiting Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday and making history: no English club has won 14 successive top-flight games during a single campaign. Conte described the match as the biggest challenge Chelsea have faced since the first of their 13 victories  at Hull on 1 October  while from Costa came the insistence that the leaders are fully aware of what awaits them at White Hart Lane, a venue where they have not won since 2012. Its a London derby so the match is played a bit stronger, he said. But thats no problem. We go there looking to do the best we can.','sport'),(8,'Mark Hughes has revealed that the Stoke City goalkeeper Jack Butland could miss the rest of the season due to the injury he sustained while playing for England 10 months ago. Butland fractured his right ankle close to half-time of the 3-2 victory over Germany in Berlin on 26 March. The player left on a stretcher and was forced to miss the European Championship in France. He was, however, expected to return for Stokes first Premier League match of the season, at Middlesbrough, but aggravated the ankle just 24 hours before that game and has suffered a number of setbacks to his recovery since. A further operation last month was intended to mean a return to action in March, but Hughes, speaking after Stokes 4-2 defeat at Chelsea on Saturday, and in the context of tieing up a long-term deal for loanee goalkeeper Lee Grant, said the 23-year-old may not play again during the current campaign. Thats a priority for us because were in a little bit of a situation with Jack Butland being unavailable for any number of months and he might not come back this season, said Hughes. He may well get back April/May time, were not sure. But were more comfortable with his situation now and understand what the problems have been. So hell be fine when he gets back. Butland was in excellent form for Stoke before his injury and was deemed a certain member of Roy Hodgsons squad for Euro 2016. Sam Allardyce was also known to view Butland as a serious contender to Joe Hart as Englands No1 during his brief spell in charge of the national team. Having managed Butland while in charge of England Under-21s, Gareth Southgate may well be keen to involve him at senior level, and would have potentially been able to do so for the friendly away to Germany on 22 March and World Cup qualifier at home to Lithuania four days later. However, the earliest Southgate might be able to select Butland is likely to be for the qualifier against Scotland at Hampden Park on 10 June. In Butlands absence, Grant, 33, has impressed following his arrival from Derby County at the end of August. He made another string of eye-catching saves at Stamford Bridge and is expected shortly to turn his loan deal into a transfer, thought to be in the region of 1.5m. Derby had originally wanted closer to 4m for the player. We lost Jack the Friday before the first game of the season so had to move quickly, said Hughes. Thankfully our goalkeeping coach Andy Quy had worked with Lee at Derby, so he knew him. It was still a risk. Hed had 300-odd games at a good level but had never played in the Premier League. But credit to him, hes proven hes a Premier League keeper.','sport'),(9,'Georginio Wijnaldum has said it is essential Liverpool follow victory over Manchester City with another three points at Sunderland on Monday to increase the pressure on Premier League leaders Chelsea. Liverpool are the closest challengers to Antonio Contes side having moved four points ahead of City with a hard-fought win at Anfield on New Years Eve. Jrgen Klopps team, who remain six points behind the leaders, kick off at struggling Sunderland less than 44 hours after the conclusion of the City match and may be without their captain, Jordan Henderson, as well as the confirmed absentees Philippe Coutinho and Jol Matip. Henderson was withdrawn with a heel injury against Pep Guardiolas team, although it is not the same heel that sidelined the midfielder for sustained spells last season. Chelsea do not play until Wednesdays awkward assignment at Tottenham Hotspur and Wijnaldum, who secured Liverpools win over City with an outstanding header, believes Sunderland is an opportunity for Klopps team to pressure the leaders by cutting the gap to three points. The Holland international said: You always have to put pressure on an opponent. We just have to win the game. Will it put pressure on them? I dont know, maybe. Sunderland is a tough game as they also want to win because of the threat of relegation. Chelsea are flying right now and doing great but we have to focus on our own game and we will see if we come closer but the main thing is to keep doing what we are doing now, win our own games and not look at Chelsea because we dont control that performance. We have to give 100% and show how good we are. We can go far but we have to show it game by game. It is going well now but we dont know how it will be going in two months so we must make sure we go all the time. Klopp said it must be annoying for Chelsea to have won 13 league games in succession and find Liverpool still on their coat-tails, and Wijnaldum credited the manager for instilling in his players the belief to beat Guardiolas expensively assembled side. He just gives us confidence. In my opinion he does not do a lot special, just gives us the confidence we need, the confidence in our own quality and that we are a good team, the midfielder explained. He spoke in the team meeting and said, We have to show our quality and show them how good you are. I was not here before Klopp came so I cant give my opinion on how the football has changed but in my opinion it is great to work under the manager. He gives players a happy feeling to play for Liverpool. What he wants is that we have joy in the things we do  training, games  and that is important for a footballer. Wijnaldum also claimed Quincy Promes, his international team-mate, would succeed at Liverpool should Klopp develop his interest in the Spartak Moscow midfielder this month. I think he knows how great Liverpool is, I knew it before I came here, said the summer recruit from Newcastle United. I dont know if everything is true about what they say as I dont speak with him about that. Of course I want him to come to Liverpool because I know he is a good player and also a good person who can help the team but it is something for the manager and the scouts, not for me.','sport'),(10,'Gary Anderson is one game from true greatness. Only Phil Taylor and Eric Bristow have won three consecutive world championships, but Anderson has the chance to join that club after an ultimately comfortable 6-3 win over Peter Wright in the semi-final. It was his 17th victory in a row at Alexandra Palace, and he has the aura to match. For so long Anderson was the underachieving genius of darts. He won his first world title two years ago at the age of 44, beating Phil Taylor 7-6 in a classic final, and followed up by retaining his title with formidable authority a year ago. Once he struggled under extreme pressure; now he is a big-game specialist, who saves his best darts for the biggest tournament of all. Anderson was never behind in a contest that was both high-class and nervy: the scoring was relentless, with 25 180s, yet both players were unusually fragile on doubles. Wright came back from 3-1 to 3-3 before Anderson ran away with the match by taking the final eight legs. There was not much between the two but the timing of Andersons big scores and big finishes  particularly a 157 to stop Wrights fightback and go 4-3 up  was decisive. Im very proud of winning the world championship twice, said Anderson. This year I just wanted to get past the first round and see what happens. The crowd have been amazing. I feel comfortable up here, for some strange reason. I knew I was scoring well  the 180s are back  and although I missed a few doubles I was glad to get over the line. I dont want to give the title up. In the previous two rounds Anderson survived ferocious assaults from Benito van de Pas of the Netherlands and Dave Chisnall from St Helens. It was expected that he would get an even greater test from Wright, the world No3 who was playing beautifully. It is a reflection of the monstrous standard of modern darts that although Anderson and Wright averaged 103.45 and 99.83 respectively, it felt like the two Scotsmen were not at their best. Wright had taken out 53% of his doubles in the tournament; against Anderson that figure dropped to 30. It was an insurmountable malfunction. He started the match with a 180 only to miss six darts at the double to win the first leg. It set the tone for a traumatic start. By the time Wright hit a double at the 11th attempt, Anderson was well on the way to a 2-0 lead. Wright had darts to win four of the first five legs but lost the lot; and when he dragged the second set back to 2-2, Anderson threw six perfect darts to extinguish any hope. When the fourth set also went to a decider on the Anderson throw, he hit consecutive 180s once again. At that stage he seemed in complete control, only for Wright to drag the match back to 3-3 with a break in the sixth set. Anderson missed two darts to win both the fifth and sixth sets. He did not make the same mistake in the seventh. With Wright waiting on 70  and with the darts should the set go to a fifth leg  Anderson took out a devastating 157. It was a hold of throw but a break of Wrights spirit. He did not win another leg as Anderson stormed through the last two sets. Ive got no excuse, I didnt play well enough, said Wright. I didnt feel comfortable on the stage. My first dart wasnt going in the treble 20, and that makes it really difficult. I really struggled to get the pitch of my darts right. And then when he gave me chances at doubles, I missed them as well. Ive only been playing with these darts since mid-November so Ill get better. Once I win a major Ill win a few. Gary took care of me tonight and beat me up, and I hope he wins his third world title.','sport'),(11,'Tony Abbott wants Australia to suspend aid to the Palestinian Authority because it keeps paying pensions to terrorists and their families. The former prime minister made the call in an opinion piece published in the Spectator Magazine on Monday. Australia gives more than $40m a year in aid to Palestine, provided through United Nations agencies and some charitable organisations. The money goes towards projects to provide Palestinian refugees with basic services such as health, education, water and sanitation. Last year, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade suspended aid to World Visions work in the Palestinian territories in the wake of allegations the charitys head in Gaza funnelled millions of dollars to militant group Hamas. The organisation has denied the claims, which are subject to court proceedings in Israel. Abbott also said Australia could demonstrate unswerving support for Israel by joining any move by the incoming Trump administration to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Most governments have kept their embassy out of Jerusalem because they do not recognise Israels occupation of east Jerusalem since 1967. Noting that Israels GDP per person was about $40,000 a year, compared with Palestines of about $2,000, Abbott blamed the economic problems of the territories on a focus on politics over economics and the all-pervading sense of grievance among Palestinians. Last week the foreign minister, Julie Bishop, strongly indicated that Australia would not have supported a UN resolution  co-sponsored by New Zealand  criticising Israels settlements policy in the West Bank and east Jerusalem. The Israeli government reacted furiously when the US abstained on the resolution. The acting opposition leader, Chris Bowen, said Australian assistance to Gaza and the West Bank was vital to counter extremism and promote peace in the Middle East. Mr Abbott is clearly using this as yet another issue to undermine Malcolm Turnbull and continue his campaign to regain the leadership by appealing to the hardliners in the Liberal party, Bowen said. Australias aid program must be transparent and accountable and must reach those it was intended to benefit, he said. Abbott recently returned from a trip to the Middle East, including Israel. He attended the Australia-Israel-UK Dialogue in Jerusalem with opposition leader Bill Shorten and other federal MPs. In his article Abbott also noted that at the dialogue Professor Nir Shaviv of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem methodically debunked the climate change theories peddled by the UN Panel. If he was right, Abbott wrote, countries like ours have been inflicting pointless economic pain upon themselves.','business'),(12,'Spoiler alert: this review contains spoilers to the Sherlock episode The Six Thatchers, which aired on 1 January 2017. It may have been discussed in advance for featuring the destruction of one strong Englishwoman  the plot involves the smashing of six statues of Margaret Thatcher  but the New Years Day episode of Sherlock will make headlines after transmission for the annihilation of another. Mary Watson, the wife of Holmess sidekick, shockingly became  following Matthew Crawley in Downton Abbey and Nigel Pargetter in The Archers  the latest fictional character sacrificed over the festive period. Sherlock co-creators Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss also work on Doctor Who, which was awarded the other prime seasonal slot on the BBC on Christmas Day. But although the franchises have to some extent overlapped, both tending towards tragicomic love stories, viewers knew that as Amanda Abbington lay slain on the floor she would not shimmeringly regenerate into another actor. The Arthur Conan Doyle story on which Gatiss based his script has busts of Napoleon being smashed by an intruder. Here, the French emperors replacement with the former British prime minister has led to some muttering about the BBCs supposed leftwing bias. But the point, as Sherlock immediately realises, is that the vandal has no political motivation: hes looking for something hidden inside a head. In one respect, Gatiss has even depoliticised the original, which is filled with references to immigrants and refugees, the outcasts of Europe. A new sub-plot involving the historical decisions of a villainous woman in Whitehall also logically seemed to lead to Thatcher, but the script again opted to give the BBC press office a quiet holiday. The bulk of the rewrite, though, stayed scrupulously close to the source. In The Adventure of the Six Napoleons, Watson notes Holmes being more nearly moved by the softer human emotions than I had ever seen him. And Benedict Cumberbatch, in The Six Thatchers, is duly allowed far beyond his usual constricted emotional range. In the middle of the last decade, two veteran fantasy brands  Doctor Who and James Bond  simultaneously hit on the idea of casting classical actors (Christopher Eccleston and Daniel Craig) who could play a Time Lord or a spy with the intensity of Hamlet. Continuing the trend, Cumberbatch stalks Baker Street like a Danish prince with a decisive streak. But this time, as if blurring with Craig, he became a sort of 00221B. The episode felt very Bond overall  Holmes has never done so much running towards or away from explosions. And thanks to the dramatic impact achieved by director Rachel Talalay, the murder of Mary matched the death of M in Skyfall. Confronted with a dead friend, her widower and their motherless baby, Cumberbatchs face (mainly required to remain blank) painted a picture of pain and confusion. And with Mary taking a bullet meant for Sherlock, Martin Freemans Watson let out an extended, escalating, animalistic moan. Its unclear how Gatiss specified the sound in the script but, for King Lear, it was written as the hardest line in theatre: Howl, howl, howl, howl! During a Q&amp;A session after a premiere screening on 19 December, Freeman and Abbington discussed the weirdness of a real-life couple acting the tragic end of a relationship. But soon afterwards, it emerged that the context was uncanny: the actors had actually separated shortly before filming. Moffat and Gatiss told the same press conference that they were unsure if the remaining cast could be united for future series. Ominously, the last episode in this run, which airs on 15 January, is called The Final Problem  the name of the Conan Doyle story in which Holmes dies. Sherlock detectives will deduce a possible significance from this being the only one of the 13 episodes to use an original title without any alteration. But even if the worst were to happen, fans of this super-intelligent and hyper-entertaining show  which reached new heights of action and emotion in The Six Thatchers  will note that Conan Doyle, after his Final Problem, had to bring the character back by popular demand.','entertainment'),(13,'And so it begins  again. A rolling, meandering soap opera that never really stops started in earnest on Sunday as the new year heralded the opening of the January transfer window. An often tedious month-long orgy of will-they wont-they drama, whisper and counter-whisper, unhappy Arsenal fans and sightings of Robert Snodgrass, it slowly builds to a climactic all-singing, all-dancing Sky Sports show-stopper hosted by an enthusiastic Scotsman who wears a yellow tie. We have been here before, many times. Fourteen, to be precise. Made compulsory by Fifa for the 2002-03 season, the January transfer window is one of two registration periods in which Premier League clubs are permitted to buy players they may or may not have been linked with by assorted TV and radio shows, newspaper gossip columns, football websites and social media accounts run by teenage schoolboys from football hotbeds such as Ludlow and Stow-on-the-Wold. Originally introduced as part of a compromise with the European Commission in order to preserve contractual stability for footballers and clubs while simultaneously allowing movement of the former at certain times of the year, the January window has since eclipsed the League Cup to become the third biggest competition in English football. The inaugural window was won by Birmingham City, who signed the World Cup and European Championship-winning striker Christophe Dugarry on loan from Bordeaux and ensured their Premier League survival with the help of four goals from the Frenchman in their final five matches of that season. And two years ago Crystal Palace came up trumps by paying just 6.8m to Manchester United to re-sign Wilfried Zaha, a fine, if occasionally gravitationally challenged, winger who recently made headlines after becoming embroiled in a disagreement with a man dressed as a giant hornet. When first mooted by Fifa in the early 1990s, the idea of introducing transfer windows received almost unanimous backing from English footballs overlords, who  rather naively, it turned out  hoped they might help reduce the often disruptive influence of nefarious agents around football clubs. In May 2002, however, the Premier League and Football League joined forces to fight against the imposition of domestic transfer windows due to the financial implications they might have in the wake of that years ITV Digital fiasco. We have charged the FA with responsibility to use the position and influence they have on Fifa committees and as a national association, to mount a full-blooded lobbying campaign to get these rules changed, thundered a Premier League spokesman at the time, before what is perhaps the only recorded historical example of his august employers failing to get their own way. As well as Dugarry, the first January window marked the arrival of cult hero Yakubu Aiyegbeni in England following his move from Maccabi Haifa to Portsmouth. The departure of Jonathan Woodgate from Leeds to Newcastle also made headlines, as did Robbie Fowlers move from Leeds United to Manchester City. In total, Premier League clubs spent 35m between them in that particular window, coincidentally the same amount Liverpool would pay Newcastle for Andy Carroll in January 2011 and 95m less than the clubs of the top flight spent this time last year. Twelve months ago, some wildly excitable soothsayers predicted that Premier League clubs would spend more than 1bn in January, but they eventually coughed up a comparative pittance of 130m. Despite the frenzied excitement it prompts among football fans, the January window is not without its critics. Arsne Wenger and Harry Redknapp are among them, the former known for his extreme frugality, while the latter has long been a reluctant poster-boy and punchline for the often ill-advised wheeler-dealing and horse-trading for which this time of year is increasingly renowned. Famous for his out-of-the-car-window appraisals of assorted triffic targets on Sky Sports News, Redknapp was more enthusiastic than most when it came to January panic buys during his time as a manager, but claimed  in the face of all evidence to the contrary  not to enjoy the mayhem of the mid-season livestock mart. Three years ago, he likened that years January window to gang warfare, saying every agent seems to be trying to screw each other in the scramble for money. A few days later, Harry was involved in one of the great deadline day farces. Having driven down to London from the Midlands in what his then manager Steve Clarke described as an act of total lunacy, a forlorn and frustrated Peter Odemwingie was left sitting and seething outside Loftus Road in his parked car as West Brom and Redknapps QPR failed to agree terms on his transfer. Despite the suspicions of some Arsenal fans who may not be aware of its existence, Wenger has long been critical of the January window, stating it is unfair, because championship rivals from the same league can move players between them in a premeditated bid to undermine his team. As conspiracy theories go its a mite tinpot and tenuous, but there can be no doubt the current system is far from perfect. With teams scrapping around the foot of the table, the January window breeds no end of panic and desperation while allowing big clubs to unsettle the better players at struggling sides before poaching them. Long may it continue; after 14 years we wouldnt have it any other way.','sport'),(14,'One in four babies born in the UK are not receiving mandatory checkups from health visitors during the first two years of their life. A fifth of babies do not receive the recommended reviews after they turn one, and one in four miss out at the age of two, according to the governments commission on social mobility. Health visitors, responsible for assessing a childs early years development, are supposed to carry out checks straight after birth, at six to eight weeks, at one year and then at between two and two-and-a-half years. However, the commission found that one in five children had not received the mandatory 12-month check by the time they reached 15 months old. London children were the least likely to receive the right number of health visits, the report found, with fewer than half receiving the final two checkups. A survey of parents found that the vast majority wanted the health visits to continue, with just 5% saying they did not feel they required advice during their first six months as a parent. Despite the conventional wisdom that parents fear interference from the nanny state, in reality many say that they welcome advice in the early years of their childs life, the commission said. It said it was concerning that one in four two-year-olds did not have their health and education needs reviewed by a professional. Despite this being a crucial period for families, there is still too little support for parents in the earliest stage of their childs life. With the socioeconomic gap in outcomes emerging early, providing support to parents at this point could reap dividends for social mobility later on in life. The Conservative partys 2010 manifesto included a key pledge to increase the number of health visitors. NHS Digital figures show the number of full-time or equivalent health visitors in England fell by almost 1,000 between October 2015 and August 2016. In December a survey of health visitors by the Institute of Health Visiting found that 85% of respondents felt their workload had increased in the last two years. Some were having to look after between 500 and 1,000 children, when the maximum recommended is 250. Labour said the commissions figures showed the government was failing to invest in early years support. Emma Lewell-Buck, the shadow minister for children and families, said: Becoming a parent for the first time is an exciting but scary time and it is shocking that not all parents are getting the support they need. The Tories promised more health visitors by taking away money from Sure Start Centres. Six years later we have lost over 700 centres and we are still waiting for the health visitors. The Tories have completely failed to invest these crucial early years. A spokesperson for Public Health England said: Ensuring every child has the best start in life is one of our key priorities. We are supporting local authorities in commissioning services that support families and provide early help when needed. We are also working with councils to give health visitors professional guidance and leadership, as well as evidence of what works, to help them meet their public health responsibilities. The commission also said parents were finding it more difficult to access local childrens centre services, citing a 2015 survey which found more than 60% of childrens centre managers said they were cutting back on services to meet their budgets. Government figures in December revealed that 156 Sure Start childrens centres had closed in England in 2015, almost double the number in the previous year.','politics'),(15,'Barack Obama on Sunday used Twitter, a medium notoriously favoured by the man who will succeed him in the White House, to tout his achievements in office. As we look ahead to the future, Obama wrote in his first tweet, I wanted to take a moment to look back on the remarkable progress that you made possible these past [eight] years. From 20 January and for the next four years, barring unforeseen circumstances, Obamas place in the Oval Office will be taken by the businessman Donald Trump. On Sunday Trumps incoming White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, told ABCs This Week the president-elect would continue to use Twitter to announce policy and make comment on current events. The medium, he said, was a way to avoid mainstream media outlets and get his message directly to the American public. Despite widespread concern over the flagrant provocation and outright disregard for protocol displayed by many of Trumps tweets, Spicer said: You know what? The fact of the matter is that when he tweets, he gets results. In an interview with CBS 60 Minutes after his election victory over Hillary Clinton, Trump said that he would now be very restrained, if I use it at all regarding social media. He has not achieved that aim. On 28 December, to take one among many examples, he used Twitter to say: Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks. Thought it was going to be a smooth transition  NOT! On Sunday, the subject of that tweet sent out sober comments about a number of results he has achieved. Facing the worst financial crisis in 80 years, he wrote, you delivered the longest streak of job growth in our history. After decades of rising healthcare costs, today nearly every American now has access to the financial security of affordable healthcare. The latter tweet spoke to a key concern among Democrats, as Trump and Republicans in Congress consider ways to repeal the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. Obama is reportedly arranging a meeting with congressional Democrats to consider ways to preserve his signature legislative achievement. The presidents next tweet hinted at progressive fears over Trumps nomination of a number of climate change deniers to key positions in his cabinet. Obama continued: We traded foreign oil for clean energy, we doubled fuel efficiency standards [and] we acted on a global scale to save the one planet weve got. He added: We brought home more of our troops [and] strengthened US leadership leading with diplomacy [and] partnering with nations to meet global problems. Obama also said: From realizing marriage equality to removing barriers to opportunity, weve made history in our work to reaffirm that all are created equal. In conclusion, the president tweeted: Its been the privilege of my life to serve as your president. I look forward to standing with you as a citizen. Happy New Year everybody. Obamas @POTUS Twitter account has 12.9 million followers, compared with 18.3 million for @RealDonaldTrump. As of 5pm ET on New Years Day, the president-elect had not tweeted anything since a series of celebratory tweets and retweets sent shortly before the turn of the year. Not long before that, he tweeted a supposedly conciliatory message: Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just dont know what to do.

There might have been some truth in it then but, these days, gold prospectors could do better by sampling termite mounds and leaves from acacia trees. New research in Western Australia reveals where remaining gold deposits might be hiding. Across the world, most of the easy gold (outcropping at the Earths surface) has already been found and gold miners have to be a bit more cunning. One area that hasnt been searched thoroughly is underneath sediments and soils. But how does a modern gold prospector know where to start digging? Ravi Anand, from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), and his colleagues gathered hundreds of samples of sediments, soil and acacia leaves from Moolart Well gold deposit, 400km north-east of Kalgoorlie. After analysing the gold content of all the samples they showed that clusters of gold occurred in zones rich in organic carbon (carbon derived from living material). Their findings are published in Geology. Anand and his colleagues believe that much of the gold in the older sediments came from underlying gold-bearing rock, via chemical and biological processes when the climate was humid. Subsequently, gold was transferred into younger sediments by the action of burrowing creatures, erosion and flooding, during the dry climate phase of the past few million years. The samples from termite mounds and acacia leaves reveal that gold is preferentially absorbed by living material, and suggests that digging deep under gold-rich trees and mounds could lead to veins of gold.','entertainment'),(17,'The crescent Moon stands between the brilliant evening star Venus and the much fainter Mars on the 2nd.

The protest continued through the game, though play was unaffected. The banner, which read Divest #NoDAPL and carried the US Bank logo, was hung in the US Bank Stadium by two people. One of the protesters, wearing a No4 Brett Favre Vikings uniform, rappelled down the banner. Members of the media were reportedly sent a message that said the stunt was designed to urge US Bank to divest from the pipeline project, which is run by Energy Transfer Partners, a Dallas-based company. At halftime, stadium manager SMG released a statement that said: Two individuals appear to have climbed over a guard rail to access the ridge truss. We immediately dispatched on-site Minneapolis police and fire departments to the scene and cleared the seating section. The company said it was working to end the protest with all stadium partners and with a primary focus on the safety of the fans and these two individuals. Construction on the Dakota Access pipeline was halted in North Dakota in December, after months of confrontation between law enforcement agencies and a coalition of Native Americans and environmentalists protesting potential damage to water resources and tribal sites. In December, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune, protesters with similar demands entered Wells Fargos offices in the city and blocked employees on their way to work. Protesters also briefly locked doors to a Wells Fargo branch. In 2014, at an All-Star baseball game at Target Field in Minneapolis, a protester gained access to the large video board and unfurled a banner that read: Love water not oil. Organisers of Sundays protest contended that US Bank has tens of millions of dollars in credit lines active with the pipelines parent company. The pipelines route violates treaty rights of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and poses a significant threat drinking water and the health of the Missouri river, their message to media reportedly said. Despite the decision by the US Army Corps of Engineers to deny a permit for the pipeline to go under the Missouri river near Standing Rock, there are fears that the incoming Trump administration will reverse that decision and permit the the pipelines completion. Energy Transfer Partners, in which Trump was revealed to have invested, took the decision to halt construction to court.','business'),(19,'When I was 13, I started wearing hijab. I had always loved swimming but had to give it up until my mother bought some Lycra fabric from Lincraft and sewed me a fluorescent pink-and-blue two-piece wetsuit with a matching swimming cap. The local pools refused to admit me wearing the suit but I was free to go to the beach. So go to the beach I did. And yet the feeling that I belonged at the beach, that it was a public space in which I was in place, sometimes eluded me. The belief that the beach is open to all runs deep in Australia. Wendy Garden, the curator of last years art exhibition On the Beach, wrote that beaches occupied a privileged place in the national psyche. The beach is seen as a great equaliser, where racial, social and gender differences are subordinate to the common pursuit of pleasure in the surf and sun. But like many of our public spaces, the iconic space of the Australian beach has always privileged a white sensory landscape. What looks and feels and sounds and smells as though it belongs is a function of power relations. Since last summer, events in Europe have sharpened potential conflicts over who and what belongs on the beach. After the terrorist attack in Nice in May, French mayors banned women from wearing burkinis on the beach in dozens of resorts and promised to defy a court ruling that the bans were illegal. At least one woman was fined by police for not wearing an outfit deemed to respect good morals and secularism. No such legal moves have been seriously proposed for Australian beaches but the climate is far from relaxed. Speaking to Muslim women from diverse walks of life about their relationship with the beach, what is striking is how their bodies, specifically their dress, have become the dominant site for contests over what is considered in place and out of place on Australian beaches. Whether it be a hijab over a rash vest and activewear leggings, or the burkini, it seems that the Muslimness of this form of dress has the capacity to provoke wary and sometimes hostile reactions. Many of the women I spoke to had a sense that their burkinis and hijabs were considered out of place. The staring, the double looks, the raised eyebrows. Its this feeling that the beach and hijab dont mix, says Sarah, a 28-year-old lawyer (all interviewees asked for full names to be withheld). People are locked into thinking theres only one way to dress and enjoy the beach. Samah laughs when she tells me that before owning a burkini, she wore tights, a long shirt and hijab to swim in and lay on the sand. One time a guy looked at me while we were in the water, she recounts. He shook his head with pity and said, Isnt it a shame you cant enjoy the sun? I laughed it off and responded that I was enjoying the sun. Mind you, the guy was wearing a long-sleeve rashie and swim cap. I had more skin exposed than he did! Growing up in Queensland, the beach has always been part of Aishas life. But when she started wearing hijab, she says she stopped feeling comfortable because of how people would stare. She opted for secluded beaches despite her concerns about swimming in places with no flags or lifeguards. It was the only way I could feel at ease to swim, she says. For some the beach has become the opposite of the peculiarly relaxed space of Australian myth. Hana, a 25-year-old journalist, was on the northern beaches of Sydney last month and interpreted the stares she received as a kind of disgust that questioned her right even to be on the beach. She says she decided against wearing her burkini and watered down her outfit of swimming cap, black tights with board shorts on top and long-sleeve rash vest, to make it less confronting. I can go anywhere in Australia and I feel so comfortable, she says, but the beach is the one place that I am fearful of because of the reaction I always receive. The norms and rules that have been allowed to dominate Australian beaches mean a bathing suit is internalised as natural, much in the same way that in India it is perfectly natural for women to wear saris and swim in the ocean. In Egypt, women jump into the Mediterranean wearing their hijabs or niqabs without issue. Another woman, Az, says it is not the job of Muslim women to prove they belong on Australian beaches. What is needed is to hold the mirror up to society and understand why we deem some forms of dress acceptable and others unacceptable. Yet many Muslim women do struggle to overcome the attitudes of others. Sana spent years on what she describes as a journey of confidence-building to wear a burkini at the beach. For years she chose not to wear it because she grew up with a feeling that only people who dress and look a certain way have claim to the beach. The beach is a space which, due to so many societal factors, is synonymous with whiteness, blond-haired, sunburnt-white skin and definitely not fully dressed women. This is about much more than bikinis v burkinis. Muslim women are particularly aware that what they wear on the beach and how they behave can be used as ammunition for wider culture wars about a mythical Australian way of life and Aussie values. Anisa is married with three children and her concerns about being a hijabi at the beach have deepened since the French bans. Some women are brave and dont care, she says, but I feel so self-conscious and as though people are judging me and my husband because hes wearing appropriate swimwear whereas I am fully covered. You can almost feel how they are viewing us as this controlling Muslim man and his poor oppressed wife  if only they knew the real dynamics! A cultural studies professor, Suvendini Perera, has argued that veiling has become the ultimate marker of cultural difference and that the veiled Muslim woman is a kind of limit-figure for the nation in the values debate. It is the awareness that their bodies are repositories for other peoples narratives and stereotypes that burdens all the women I spoke to. And yet many Muslim women resist the negative responses of others to lay claim to their beach space. Abs tells me she self-counsels herself: I constantly tell myself not to care what others are thinking of my appearance. This self-counselling empowers me to enjoy myself and my time with my children. Samar is just as resolved to ignore the stares and weird looks and rock the burkini when Im swimming. For Layla, for whom the beach washes away stress and anxiety, presumptions that she cannot swim and is weighed down by her burkini only make her laugh. Its not simply that these women use the beach in spite of being positioned as out of place. They seek to redefine out of place, challenging dominant assumptions and sensory reactions to their presence. Laylas relationship with the beach has evolved from a site of resistance to the staring and comments, to a place which she says she has trained myself to think of as my space too.','politics'),(20,'New Yorkers got their first chance to ride a new subway extension on Sunday, after almost 100 years of planning and construction. To loud cheers, the first Q train to run from 96th Street in Manhattan to Coney Island set off soon after noon. New York governor Andrew Cuomo was aboard to celebrate an engineering project his administration has made a matter of state and city pride. Its the inaugural ride, Cuomo told a large crowd who pushed their way into the subway cars. Its exciting, and its a great way to start the new year here in New York. The completion of the $4.4bn Second Avenue line  technically a four-stop extension of the Q  is a substantial achievement for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The line was conceived in 1929, at the height of the Jazz Age, and its construction started 45 years ago, in 1972. It stopped soon after when the city ran out of money. The project restarted in 2007 and was completed on time. The nearly two-mile segment adds stations along Second Avenue in the Upper East Side, at 96th, 86th and 72nd streets, and a new connection to an existing line at 63rd. City planners have long considered the extension critical to easing congestion on a system that carries 5.6 million riders on an average weekday. On Sunday, Second Avenue residents expressed excitement over their new mobility but also anxiety over whether the line would hasten gentrification in an area widely regarded as one of the last comparatively affordable spots in Manhattan, a borough where the average apartment price hit $2m last year. The rents might go up a bit but itll bring way more customers to the restaurants on Second Avenue, said Pam Miller, who was riding the Q with her son, Ben. Makeup artist Toby Klinger, 36, said the extension would make the area more livable. Ive been living on Second Avenue almost my whole life and were already seeing rapid gentrification, she said. Klinger rejected the notion that with the help of the new line and the planned closure and renovation of the L train to Brooklyn, the Upper East Side might become a new Williamsburg  home to a surging population of millennials in hipster uniform. I like being the only hipster, said Klinger. It used to be a very diverse neighbourhood with a mixture of white, black, Latino and Arab families, and its becoming a place for young professionals to dock their iPhones. The character of the neighbourhood is changing completely. Alan Behr, a lawyer, said the opening would allow a far easier commute to Midtown. The construction of the line had already changed the neighbourhood, he said, with local stores losing business as a result of the disruption. Behr, 62, doubted the new line would lead to a rapid transformation. The Upper East Side is a much quieter neighborhood than downtown, he said. When a woman was killed in a hit and run at 10.30 at night, nobody saw it because everyone was asleep. But in New York, when you can get from here to there, its always a pro. Anything that gets mass transit running faster is a good. The prices may go up but at least were going faster. This is our first new foray into mass transit, and thats important for us. Amid the positivity, there were some dissenting voices. Bienvenida Rodriguez, who said she had lived in the neighbourhood for 37 years, said the construction had been noisy and scary. Weve had explosions, she said, sometimes we had no water. Its been rough for the people living here. I hope now it wont be dangerous but Im afraid the homeless will come here now. So were praying for the best. Other passengers, however, noted that the new stations were a vast improvement on the citys existing stations, many of which date to the early 20th century. The new stations feature striking artwork. At 96th Street, the transportation authority commissioned Sarah Sze, who represented the US at the Venice Biennale in 2013. Her new works use the intense blue of Spanish pottery. At 86th Street, Chuck Close has created 12 large-scale portraits of subjects including composer Philip Glass, the late Lou Reed and three other painters, Cecily Brown, Alex Katz and Kara Walker. Elsewhere, there is work by Vik Muniz, Jean Shin, Zhang Huan and Sienna Shields. Its fabulous, said another passenger, Lauren Michaels. The trains are bright, the concourse is clean and Ive been reading about the artwork, which looks pretty interesting. I like the way they chose a different artist for each station, and actually doing art. Lets see how it wears. More than2,000 people worked on the extension, tunneling through granite and digging through sand and mud. The line is also meant to run north through Harlem and ultimately into the Bronx but no date has been set for that phase of construction. This was a long time coming, noted Cuomo as the first train pulled out. Disembarking at 86th Street, the governor offered a jovial assessment of his trip. Theres no steering wheel and no brakes so it was a good thing they wouldnt let me drive, said Cuomo, who is reported to be eyeing a 2020 presidential run against another prominent New Yorker, Donald Trump. I was along for the ride. It was the first ride and it was a great one.','business'),(21,'On a sodden, cold and otherwise underpowered afternoon at the Emirates Stadium Olivier Giroud provided an unforgettable moment of illumination. The Frenchman has found himself down the pecking order in recent months, demoted to second choice as collateral damage to Alexis Snchezs reinvention as a spiky central striker. One thing does seem certain, though. Whatever direction Girouds strangely divisive five-year Arsenal career takes from here, however the clubs hotly-contested modern history ends up remembering him, he is unlikely to have a better moment, in isolation, than the opening goal here. Olivier, old boy, well always have Palace. What are we calling it then? A Henrikh? A studs-up, reach-back semi-scorpion? Perhaps the greatest no-look donkey-kick breakaway volley youre likely to see outside the pixelated world of early 1990s arcade machines? Certainly Henrikh Mkhitaryan does seem have been on to something with his discovery of the sole-of-the-boot, reach-around volley. Girouds version, the opener in this 2-0 defeat of a disappointing Crystal Palace, was even better. The build-up was wonderfully slick. Lucas Prez won the ball and slipped it to Hctor Bellern. Girouds back-heel found Granit Xhaka, who passed to Alex Iwobi. He did exactly the right thing at exactly the right speed, driving forward and zipping an instant pass to Snchez. Snchez paused, looked up and floated a cross just behind Giroud as he rumbled into the box. Hmmm. What to do now? Hang on. In a moment of extreme, imaginative spatial awareness Giroud stretched his left foot up behind his shoulder and sent the ball arcing off his studs past his own left ear and over Wayne Hennessey. With an added gloss the ball even had the presence of mind to clang in off the underside of the crossbar, thereby adding a 20% premium on goal of the season scores, a principle known as Yeboahs Law. Giroud, charming as ever, laughed afterwards and said his finish was lucky, that he was off balance and just made something up in the moment. It was certainly a fluke in the sense that nobody could realistically hope to do it again. As the ball crossed the line there was an odd moment of hush around the Emirates, the air seeming to disappear out of the stadium then rush back in with a gulp at the pure audacity of a moment that had little in common with the angsty bustle that made up most of the opening 45 minutes. Or indeed little in common with the recent trajectory of Girouds Arsenal career. The absence from recent starting XIs is a consequence in part of his own late return from the Euro 2016 final. But Giroud remains an oddly divisive figure, a cumbersome No9 who can look both immobile and also razor sharp, blunt and brilliantly bullish, at times all within the same attack. His start here was just his second in the league this season. Arsenal have looked sharper and more direct in his absence. But he still has six Premier League goals in his last four starts, albeit across seven months since the end of last season. Indeed, his goalscoring record is good throughout his entire time at Arsenal, even if the impression remains of a fine plan B dressed up in the ill-fitting tinsel of a first choice A-lister. The transition from Robin van Persie, a glistening, pedigree, title-winning striker replaced by a hopeful workhorse seemed to sum up, for some, the frustrations of the late austerity years. Giroud scores at a similar rate to the man he replaced. But critics will say he just doesnt seem to do so at the right time, or against the right teams, or with the right degree of match-sealing elan. Shortly before his goal here he missed an absolute sitter, failing to connect in front of goal as Nacho Monreal flashed a volleyed cross though the six-yard box. The ball was skimming and slick on the surface. But being in place to prod those in is pretty much the job, not the one-off worldie back-flick stuff. In one sense even that wondrous opening goal was simply a large, quite slow man falling over to brilliant effect, a moment of pub-football art. Girouds own reaction was lovely, pure joy but also laughter. In the seats the home fans also giggled and danced and hugged rather than just punching the air and acting as though this was anything other than an isolated moment of extreme skill, plus an indication of the basic fun, the occasional silliness of sport. Arsenal scored again on 56 minutes, this time through a well-placed header from Iwobi. Girouds moment aside Iwobi was their best player and most significant presence. Given a chance to play at No10 in Mesut zils absence through illness, Iwobi had a fine game. Socks half-rolled down, not exactly quick but persistent, not exactly powerful but tenacious, he was careful with the ball, and always looking to drive forward and inflict pain on the Palace defence. Arsne Wenger was generous in his praise afterwards. Seasons rarely turn on fine moments, and Arsenals fans will take just as much heart form Iwobis craft as they will from a goal that will live long in the memory.','sport'),(22,'In 2017, how might progressives win? Even posing the question feels odd  almost a category error  since winning scarcely exists as a referent in so much of progressive practice. The late Peter Cook used to perform a sketch in which he played a leftie working for the media empire of Lord Beaverbrook (think Rupert Murdoch). Cook assures his friend that he remains as radical as ever. There are about 10 of us on the paper, young, progressive, liberal people who dont believe a word we are writing, and whenever the old man has a party  a cocktail party  we all gather together down the far end of the room and drink as much as we can  we really knock it back  we drink and drink and drink  trying to break him from within; then  quite openly, behind our hands  we snigger at him. The friend looks doubtful: Well, it doesnt seem very much to me  sniggering and tittering. A titter there, a titter here, says Cook. It all adds up. Thats very familiar today. On the left, we spend our time calling out and shutting down, lolling and meming and dropping mics. But winning? What does that even mean? Lets put the problem another way. Traditionally, progressives defined themselves, at least in part, by a desire for change. The right defended the status quo; the left agitated to overthrow or at least ameliorate it. Progressives sought progress, movement, transformation, forcing the old to give to the new until wed built a modern Jerusalem. The instability of 2016 will continue. You can feel it everywhere: all that is solid preparing to melt into air. With change so palpably afoot, this should be our time. So why isnt it? In 1939, WH Auden wrote The Unknown Citizen to satirise the managerial revolution already then under way. Today, the poem reads like an eerie anticipation of liberal incredulity at Brexit and Trump and the other recent upheavals. Was he free? Was he happy? The question is absurd: Had anything been wrong, we should certainly have heard. In theory, progressives recognise the necessity of fundamental social change. In practice, weve responded to explosive manifestations of discontent with a mixture of fury and disbelief, aghast not just at the reactionary sentiments expressed but at the very existence of a dissatisfaction about which we knew nothing whatsoever. All over the world, pollsters report deep unhappiness with the institutions of liberal capitalism. Yet somehow the left  a movement dedicated to social transformation  has become the defender of a status quo that no one much else likes. Francis Adams was also a poet (though far less distinguished than Auden). In 1889, he explained his parallel career as an activist: Five years ago, I broke up my health in the struggle then just beginning to organise the unskilled London labour. It seemed a failure. But I never despaired, or saw cause to despair. There was a splendid foundation of hate there. With hate, all things are possible. Its difficult to imagine a progressive saying that today: the formulation sounds more like a grab from one of those well-coiffured Nazi boys currently clinging to Trumps coattails. Actually, though, Adams was a gentle and sensitive man, a rare opponent of the anti-Asian racism dominating the Australian labour movement. What he meant was that the London workers found their situation intolerable  and their justified anger fuelled the New Unionism that transformed British politics. Well, theres a splendid foundation of hate today, too  and if we dont build something positive from it, the edifices that will inevitably emerge will be very ugly indeed. Unfortunately, so much of what passes for activism now centres on an individualised moralism, less about changing the world than about making yourself feel (or perhaps sound) good while all about you everything remains exactly the same. In 1959, Raymond Williams described the seemingly insurmountable gulf between the progressive intellectuals of his day and the great bulk of the population. Nothing, he wrote, has done more to sour the democratic idea among its natural supporters, and to drive them back into angry self-exile, than the plain, overwhelming cultural issues: the apparent division of our culture into, on the one hand, a remote and self-gracious sophistication, on the other hand, a doped mass. Since, then, of course, that division has only widened. The academic Colin Crouch describes a tendency to post-democracy, in which public electoral debate is a tightly controlled spectacle, managed by rival teams of professionals expert in the techniques of persuasion, and considering a small range of issues selected by those teams [while] the mass of citizens plays a passive, quiescent part, responding only to the signals given them. We all know exactly what he means. But thats why its worth rereading Williams. After all, many progressives reacted to Brexit and to Trump by demanding more rather than less state control over the citizenry. Aghast at the reactionary ideas that emerged during those votes (the misogyny, the xenophobia, the outright racism), they concluded that ordinary people couldnt be trusted and needed better, more efficient management from the political class. To put it another way, confronted by widespread hatred for post-democracy, they doubled-down on the post bit rather than the democracy aspect. Williams suggests a very different orientation. So who then believes in democracy? he asks. The answer is really quite simple: the millions  who still havent got it where they work and feel. There, as always, is the transforming energy   He sees the resistance to top-down management, the desire for self-expression and self-determination in the workplace and the school and the home, as an opportunity for the left, not a threat. The business of the socialist intellectual is what it always was: to attack the clamps on that energy  in industrial relations, public administration, education, for a start; to work in his own field on ways in which that energy, as released, can be concentrated and fertile. Its a challenging formulation as we approach 2017, flying in the face of whats become progressive common sense: the condescending conviction that only enlightened liberal stewardship stands between civilisation and the hordes of tabloid-reading Morlocks. But Williams recognises that, too. The technical means [of facilitating participatory democracy] are difficult enough, he says, but the biggest difficulty is in accepting, deep in our minds, the values on which they depend: that the ordinary people should govern   Thats not to deny the genuinely disturbing racism manifesting in the US and across Europe. On the contrary, its to suggest a strategy  or at least the raw beginnings of one  to combat it. Williamss point is that a left orienting to participation, to mass involvement and to democracy stands a better chance of overcoming the demagoguery of the far right through what he calls the transforming energy of the masses, since people exercising some control over their workplaces, their universities, their homes and cultural lives are less susceptible to the imaginary solutions of scapegoating and bigotry. No one can offer a blueprint for activism in 2017. The only certainty in times like this is that certainties will be confounded. Nonetheless, its difficult to believe that, in societies governed by some of the least popular leaders on record (from Trump to Turnbull), the next 12 months wont bring further eruptions of discontent. How then will we respond? The temptation will be, once again, to defend liberal values by reinforcing the institutions of liberalism. But thats not going to work. Quite simply, progressives must discover progress. Rather than buttressing a moribund status quo, the left needs to place itself on the side of change. Thats how we win  by reclaiming the notion of a better future from the reactionaries and demagogues.','politics'),(23,'Arsne Wenger described Olivier Girouds spectacular goal in Arsenals 2-0 home win against Crystal Palace as a work of art, and said it must rank in his all-time top five over his 20-year tenure at the club. Giroud set Arsenal on their way to victory in the 17th minute, when he flicked an Alexis Snchez cross, which was one yard behind him, with his left heel over his own head and into Wayne Hennesseys net off the underside of the crossbar. He had been about 12 yards out at the point of the connection. Alex Iwobi scored Arsenals second to crown an impressive individual display, which lifted his team back into third place in the Premier League, above Tottenham Hotspur, who had won 4-1 at Watford earlier in the day. But the occasion at the Emirates Stadium was all about Girouds moment of magic, which carried shades of Henrikh Mkhitaryans finish for Manchester United against Sunderland on Boxing Day. It was an exceptional goal, because it was at the end of a fantastic collective movement, which is what our game is about, Wenger said, with a nod towards the box-to-box counterattack. After that, it was a reflex. Any goal-scorer is ready to take any part of his body, even if its the little toe, to score a goal and Olivier had that kind of reflex. He transformed that goal, I would say, into art. It was art because of the surprise, because of the beauty of the movement and because of the efficiency of the movement. That will be remembered as the Giroud goal, which nobody will forget. Every striker is certainly remembered for one or two or three special goals and that will certainly remain with him forever. Olivier brings the unexpected and we all come to football to get the unexpected. I have been spoiled in my career because I had many great strikers but that is certainly in my top five [of great goals]. Hctor Bellern, the Arsenal right-back, said that he couldnt believe it when the goal went in but Giroud was modest. I have maximum luck, he said. I was off balance and I tried to deflect it  in this position, you cant do something else. Ive never done this before, so its all about luck. Its a great feeling. Wenger was asked to list the other goals in his top five and, off the top of his head, he actually named five. I remember [Dennis] Bergkamp at Leicester and at Newcastle; Thierry Henry at Real Madrid and at Liverpool, and Kanu at Chelsea. Its difficult for me to say, over 20 years, when we score about 70, 80 per year. By 20, it makes 1,600. Its hard, in a second, to get the best five. The importance of the game matters, and also when its 0-0. What is maybe not acknowledged enough by people, maybe even me, is that Olivier scores important goals. He equalised at Man United this season [in the 89th minute] with the special header and he scored [the winner] against West Brom in the 86th minute. He scores goals that have weight in the result of the team.','sport'),(24,'Britains top GP has said surgeries will have to stop seeing patients during the week unless ministers abandon their drive to guarantee access to family doctors at weekends. Dr Helen Stokes-Lampard condemned the policy, a key Conservative pledge, as unrealistic and said it was ignoring the lack of demand among patients to see GPs at weekends and a serious shortage of family doctors. The government has promised to ensure that people in every part of England will be able to see a GP from 8am to 8pm every day of the week by 2020 as a key element of its push to create a truly seven-day NHS by the end of the current parliament. Its unrealistic in the current climate. We havent got the people, we havent got the resources. If you give people access on a Sunday afternoon theyre not going to have access on a Tuesday morning. They cant have it all, the chair of the Royal College of GPs said in an interview. Calling for surgeries weekend opening to be restricted to Saturday mornings, Stokes-Lampard said: We should be responding to what is needed in an area, and balance that realistically by what can be provided safely. Because quite frankly if you open on a Sunday afternoon but youre closed on a Tuesday morning, whos going to benefit?. There is so little demand from patients to see a GP on Sundays that plans to compel at least one surgery in each area to open on that day by 2020 should be dropped, she said. Nor do many people want to attend a surgery on a Saturday afternoon, she added. David Cameron pledged access to GPs from 8am to 8pm seven days a week at the Conservative party conference in 2014, and established a 50m challenge fund to deliver it. Some surgeries that have begun opening at weekends, however, have scrapped their experiment because of the small numbers of patients seeking appointments on Saturdays and Sundays. A relentless rise in the need for care is prompting more GPs to retire early or move abroad, leaving the profession facing a growing workforce crisis and patients facing long waits for appointments, Stokes-Lampard said. As a result were layered too thin at the moment, were spread too thin. We cant sustain a good five-day service at the moment, a seven-day service is unrealistic. If we cant provide eight to six Monday to Friday because were stretched to breaking point, were certainly not going to be able to provide seven days a week. She said general practice was closer to the edge than it has ever been in living memory, and cast serious doubt on ministers being able to fulfil another key NHS pledge  to increase the number of GPs in England by 5,000 by 2020 compared with 2015. It will be very hard to deliver that number without many GPs coming from overseas or former doctors being persuaded back into work, she said. The Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb, who was a coalition health minister until May 2015, denounced the pledge of access to GPs all day and every day as a superficially attractive gimmick. This target is driven by seductive headlines, not sound policy. It will distort priorities and resources away from action which could make a real difference to peoples lives, such as ensuring that people have both their physical and mental health needs effectively met in primary care, he said. No one believes that there will be sufficient resources to deliver this plan. The risk is that it will leave dangerous gaps in provision during the week. Pursuing superficially attractive gimmicks like this amounts to a smokescreen for the dire threat the NHS and care system now faces as it is starved of the resources it needs to provide effective, prompt and safe care. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said: These serious doubts about a flagship government pledge will raise widespread concerns. Its yet another warning about the scale of the underfunding and understaffing now impacting our NHS. In her six months as prime minister Theresa May has shown no regard for the state of the NHS, so its no surprise it now looks like her own manifesto commitments will be broken. But in 2017 the government simply must not carry on ignoring the warnings. Instead they need to come forward with a genuine plan to give the NHS and social care the resources they need to deliver the very best care every patient deserves. The Department of Health insisted the government would achieve its ambition of seven-day opening, and that the policy was popular. This is a common sense reform with wide public support, and one we will deliver, a spokeswoman said. People dont just get ill Monday to Friday, nine to five, and 18 million patients now have weekend and extended access to a GP, which has already shown evidence of relieving pressure on other parts of the NHS. To deliver our pledge, we are putting an extra 2.4bn into GP services, which will help expand the workforce.','politics'),(25,'Istanbul is on high alert as the hunt for a gunman, who fled after killing 39 people at a nightclub on New Years Eve, continues. President Recep Tayyip Erdoan vowed in a statement that Turkey would fight terrorism till the end following the attack at Reina in Istanbuls upmarket Ortaky neighbourhood. Turkey will stand together and not give passage to dirty games of terrorists, he said. Mehmet Grmez, Turkeys most senior Muslim cleric, condemned the attack as savagery and a massacre that no Muslim conscience can accept. There was condemnation from around the world as well as inside Turkey. The US State Department described the attack as heinous and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said it was hard to imagine a more cynical crime. The attack came at the end of a year of terrorist incidents across Europe, including the driving of a truck into a Christmas market in Berlin earlier in December. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, sent her condolences to the victims of the Istanbul attack, saying terrorists ... have carried out an inhumane and devious attack on people who wanted to celebrate the new year together. A Downing Street spokesman said Theresa May had written to Erdoan after the attack to offer her condolences. She said her thoughts were with the Turkish people after this further devastating terrorist attack, and confirms the UK stands ready to help, No 10 said. In his new years address, Pope Francis said: Unfortunately, violence has stricken even in this night of good wishes and hope. Pained, I express my closeness to the Turkish people. I pray for the many victims and for the wounded and for the entire nation in mourning. I ask the Lord to sustain all men of good will to courageously roll up their sleeves to confront the plague of terrorism and this stain of blood that is covering the world with a shadow of fear and a sense of loss. The gunman entered Reina, a club on the Bosphorus that has long been a favourite of tourists, a little after 1am, shot a police officer and then opened fire inside the club with a Kalashnikov rifle, before fleeing the scene. Istanbuls governor, Vasip ahin, told reporters: At 1.15am, a terrorist carrying a long-barrelled weapon martyred the police officer waiting outside, and then martyred another citizen to enter. He then carried out this violent and cruel act by spraying bullets on innocent people who were celebrating the new year. The interior minister, Sleyman Soylu, said the gunman was still at large, after reports initially said the attacker was killed. Police were deployed around key areas of the city and several roads near the scene of the attack were closed off. Witnesses described scenes of chaos as revellers attempted to flee, some even throwing themselves into the Bosphorus to escape the gunfire. Outside ili Etfal hospital, Sinem Uyank said she had been at the club with her husband, who was wounded in the attack. Before I could understand what was happening, my husband fell on top me, she told Associated Press. I had to lift several bodies from on top of me before I could get out. It was frightening. She said her husbands condition was not serious. It was unclear how the attacker managed to escape from the club, which is just across the street from a police station. One report suggested he abandoned his weapon and mingled with the crowd outside pretending to be an injured civilian. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack. Turkeys prime minister, Binali Yldrm, said an investigation into the identity of the gunman was ongoing but he was not prepared to share details yet. There was conflicting information on Sunday evening about the identities of the foreigners who were killed in the attack. Selin Doan, an opposition politician from Istanbul who toured the hospitals and the morgue at the forensic institute, said the dead included citizens from Saudi Arabia, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Tunisia, Kuwait and Israel, as well as a Belgian-Turkish dual national and a Canadian-Iraqi. The Jordanian foreign ministry said three of its citizens were also killed in the attack. Among the victims was a Tunisian couple and twins from Saudi Arabia. Doan said the dead all had gunshot wounds and that 11 bodies had been delivered to their families. Turkey has endured numerous terror attacks over the past year by Islamic State militants and Kurdish separatist groups. Three weeks ago a twin bombing outside the football stadium in the district of Beikta killed 46 people, most of them police officers, two hours after a football match. The latest attack has again shaken a country that endured a string of high profile bombings, including in the busy Atatrk airport last summer and near the Hagia Sophia mosque, as well as an attempted military coup in July. Shortly after the nightclub attack, relatives of local staff gathered outside the police cordon to await news of their loved ones. Two men collapsed in tears and sobbed upon receiving news that a relative had died in the attack. Another man who was in the club described a chaotic scene with people rushing for the exits, but was in too much shock to offer a detailed account of the assault. At the forensic institute in Istanbul, some families gathered to collect the bodies of the victims. Stephanie Deek, a Lebanese woman, said her friend was with her husband at the club when the attack happened. They were just tourists, married for five months, and they wanted to find the perfect place to spend New Years Eve, said Deek. The husband, a 35-year old Lebanese man called Haykal Musallem, was in the bathroom when the attack began. His wife rushed out of the club, while he apparently attempted to jump into the Bosphorus to flee, but was killed. Im feeling so sad, she said. I cant even talk or express my feelings. But there was also anger at what some saw as heightened polarisation and rhetoric in the run-up to the attack. Conservative clerics and media outlets have railed against the sinfulness of new years celebrations in recent days. Tabloid newspapers with deeply religious audiences ran headlines such as: This is a last warning: do not celebrate and: Down with your civilisation with images of party-goers next to images of deprivation in Syria, where nearly half a million people have been killed in an ongoing civil war. The target of the attack prompted some observers to see it as directed against Turkeys secular character, in the midst of an ongoing struggle to define the republics identity. Akif Hamzaebi, a lawmaker from the Republican Peoples party (CHP), described the assault as an attack on a way of life and and said it was savage. The aim is to plant seeds of hatred among society, he said, speaking after visiting the wounded in Istanbuls ili Etfal hospital. We do not want to live with the acceptance of terror and the state should teach a lesson to the terrorist organisations. An influential CHP deputy from Istanbul, Grsel Tekin, said at the hospital: In the coming days we should be talking about this  in the last week there were so many messages which can damage our social peace but none of these messages were investigated. Those responsible should resign.

They had been positive for the first 45 minutes and the manager felt that it showed they were over their Champions League exit.

The pair looked beaten as the 2-1 favourite, LAmi Serge, went clear on the run-in but Kelly regathered her mount and drove him back in front as the line came. Kelly and her stepfather, Nick Williams, who trained both her winners, have had a troubled start to this jumps season. From April to December, she managed only three victories, while Williamss stable had just a couple more. Their period in the doldrums was the more surprising for following so soon after a Grade One success with Tea For Two last season and Agraparts win in the Betfair, Europes most valuable handicap hurdle. The 23-year-old Kelly said after Agraparts return to the winners enclosure in this Grade Two: This horse is a legend. I knew he had a great shout. We came in quietly at 16-1 but the way he won the Betfair, I knew hed stay further and its rained all day, which was always going to suit him. Its been a real hard season up to now. I know Im trying my best out there and it is difficult, watching race after race with no real results. Fingers crossed this continues now. I had a double at Towcester on Boxing Day a few seasons ago and in point-to-points back in the day, but this is easily my most significant double. Kelly is the only woman to have ridden a Grade One winner in British jump racing. While professional female jump jockeys remain in short supply, five of them enjoyed wins around the country yesterday, the others being Lucy Alexander, Lucy Gardner, Megan Carberry and Bridget Andrews. Williams said Agrapart would now be aimed at the Stayers Hurdle over an extra half-mile, since the horse might lack the pace for races over the Relkeel distance once the ground dries up in March. But the Stayers has a strong favourite in Unowhatimeanharry and bookmakers were sufficiently relaxed about the threat posed by Agrapart to leave him on 33-1. Coo Star Sivola, who also scored for Kelly and Williams, is probably not good enough for a place in the Festivals Neptune Novice Hurdle. The trainer suggested he might line up instead in the Martin Pipe Handicap, a race for conditional jockeys in which Kelly is able to take part. Nicky Henderson was foiled by the defeat of LAmi Serge, whose jockey, Daryl Jacob, had a mud-slathered boot slip out of its stirrup in the closing stages. But the Lambourn trainer won the other Grade Two on the card when Whisper held off the odds-on favourite, Clan Des Obeaux, by half a length. Twice a Grade One winner over hurdles in years gone by, Whisper was in lifeless form last season but is unbeaten in two runs this winter, both over fences at Cheltenham. On this occasion, he benefited from a badly timed mistake by his main rival at the second-last. Hes just tough and genuine and is a real friend, said Henderson, who suggested the nine-year-olds Festival target would be the JLT, while adding the caveat that Whisper may yet step up to three miles for the RSA. The key question now is whether he has a run before the Festival. He doesnt need to have one. Willy Twiston-Davies rode his first winner at Cheltenham aboard Cogry, five years after being unseated from Baby Run with the Foxhunter Chase at his mercy. The jockey has been riding on the Flat for most of the intervening period but has recently taken a break from that and suggested here that the endless round of all-weather racing had ceased to grip him. The jockeys father, Nigel, who trains Cogry, was delighted for his son and also for the horse, who was seeking a boost to his confidence after two falls, an unseat and a brought-down, from four starts over fences this season. Thats what they both needed, said Twiston-Davies Sr. The horse had a miserable time and none of those things had been his fault. Ever since his last fall we thought we would give up over fences for one or two races. His jumping was just impeccable. It was so great that William could ride him.','sport'),(28,'Australias squad for the summer-ending Sydney is often anomalous. A turning wicket, a dead series or even a new year can lend an incongruity to the summer preceding it. Mitch Marsh and Peter Nevill batted at three and four respectively at the SCG last year. Its where Colin Miller once opened the bowling and Stuart MacGill would always get a game. Of all home Tests, this is the one where the course, broadly speaking, truly appears to dictate the horse. In that sense its a convenient setting for selectors to mask the abandonment of its short-lived six specialist batsmen policy, instead racing back into the arms of the all-rounder who can do a bit of both. Their fondness for the player who serves as insurance against fast bowling fatigue and injury is well understood, even if said players actual effectiveness isnt. Australias recent series losses to England, Sri Lanka and South Africa were largely built on paltry batting returns; securing twenty wickets was rarely an issue. Hilton Cartwright might promise the fast bowling cadre an extra breather, but at what cost to Australian runs? Glibly speaking, cricket teams have 11 players and the sixth spot is its mathematical middle. As such, the style of player selected there reveals much about the teams approach. Amid the extensive praise for Asad Shafiqs superb innings in Brisbane laid an uncomfortable question for Australia: when was the last time a number six influenced a match so heavily for the men in green and gold? Beneath it sits a deeper question at the heart of Australias approach to its number six role: what does the team need more help with? Batting or bowling? Australian cricket  so often purveyor of confidence and simplicity  is unaccustomed to tying itself in philosophical knots, though something shifted about ten years ago. After a reasonably stable commitment to six batsmen, four bowlers and a keeper, selectors uncharacteristically uprooted policy. Maybe it was Adam Gilchrists retirement, maybe it was Andrew Flintoffs destruction, maybe they were scared of life post-Warne (some of us still are), but from late 2005, selectorial orthodoxy was abandoned in a desperate search for an Australian all-rounder to call its own; someone to win matches with profound contributions in both disciplines, who could compound that value by shouldering a load that would leave their specialists fresh. In other words, someone approaching the perfect cricketer. Throughout history, there hasnt been many. Of course, Australia never found its Freddie. It found Shane Watson, though to most he never seemed enough. As the search continues, history will be increasingly kind to him. The futility of Australias search revealed more about the rare brilliance of Flintoff than anything else. Unable to find an antipodean equivalent Australia lowered its bar a little. Instead of an intense, passionate, match-winning heartthrob with bat and ball, its since sought players who can help out a bit in both parts of the game; the real chip in Test cricketer. After Watson, Mitchell Marsh was bequeathed the role. He proved able-enough foil with the ball, providing those so-treasured 10 to 15 overs to relieve the bowling cartel. But he didnt score enough runs and people started to pine again for a Real Australian Number Six. And besides, what good was a potent attack if it had no runs to bowl to? Marsh, as bowling all-rounders are wont to do, bolstered the bowling but robbed the batting. The role has always had the feel of robbing Peter to pay Paul. So selectors reverted to the pre-2005 convention. Six batsmen, four bowlers and a keeper. Callum Ferguson and Nic Maddinson  earmarked prodigies from successive generations  were brought in to once again uphold the lofty traditions of the position once held by proper run scorers: Walters, Waugh, Ponting and Martyn, to name a few. Both selections polarised opinion, but there was a deeper point beneath. Australia had shifted strategy. Once again, they would select the best players in each of crickets primary disciplines. The role-player was vanquished. But the break-up always felt temporary. Unhelped by Maddinsons quadruple failures, Australian bowling coach David Sakers recent comments suggested the all-rounder  once it got its act together  would always be welcomed back in the house. Put forward by Cricket Australia to speak at a Test match press conference on behalf of the Australian Cricket team, in Australian cricket uniform, as one of its senior coaches, he claimed to be an outsider without influence as he unequivocally plumped for another bowler to help the quicks. We are desperately looking for that all-rounder who can bowl some overs for us, Saker said. The comments arrived after Pakistan had posted 450 in Brisbane followed by 443 on a comatose MCG wicket. Naturally, if youre overworked and unsupported you appeal for help. Nurses, teachers and anyone whos ever had a tough job will empathise. Its uncertain whom Saker was referring to by we. Further, how Nic Maddinson was to interpret those comments ahead of his final, and failing, shot says much about how temporary he really was, and how wedded Australia is to the all-rounder number six. So Australia returns to the role player. Its a curious phenomenon in long form cricket. For a game requiring such exclusive expertise in two separate disciplines  where being proficient at even one is hard enough  how teams can contrive to find a place for someone not singularly expert in either appears counterintuitive. And whereas Australias batting group waited years for a policy shift, two long innings was all it took for a reversal. This turnaround reveals much: how important Australias fast bowlers are to winning, how little it trusts its spinners, and how reliant it is on the triumvirate of Smith, Warner and Khawaja to post competitive totals.','sport'),(29,'Mauricio Pochettino wants to harness the sort of feeling that surrounded Leicesters run to the title last season when Tottenham face the leaders Chelsea on Wednesday and believes the rest of the Premier League will be cheering for his team. Tottenham pulled to within 10 points of Antonio Contes team by defeating Watford 4-1 on Sunday. Pochettino suggested the chasing pack, led by Liverpool, who are six points behind Chelsea in second, will now will the home side to win at White Hart Lane, claiming that when Tottenham were fighting at the top with Leicester, it was their then-rivals who attracted similar goodwill. Maybe we will feel how Leicester felt last season, the Spurs manager said when asked whether he expects the likes of Liverpool and Arsenal to be rooting for Tottenham to stop what currently seems an irresistible force  Chelsea made it 13 wins in a row with a 4-2 triumph over Stoke on Saturday. It was all the teams with them and against us. Maybe [Chelsea] will feel the same as us last season. It is not an outlandish thought that a Tottenham win would bring them back into contention, such is their current level of performance, but Pochettino was keen to point out that the division as a whole might benefit from Chelseas winning run coming to an end. Chelsea arrive in a very good shape, we too, and it will be a very tough game but a great opportunity for us to try and stop them and reduce the gap, he said. I think it is important for the Premier League and for us that we try and win. Then our challenge is to be in the top four. The latter, at least, is reality at present and Pochettino was delighted with the performance that took Tottenham above Manchester City on goal difference. Two goals apiece from Harry Kane and Dele Alli saw Spurs record a fourth successive victory. I think it was nearly a perfect game, said Pochettino. The shame was that we conceded a goal in the last minute but there were a lot of positive things and Im very happy. Now we have two or three days to try and prepare in the best way for Chelsea. Pochettinos players adapted well to his switch to a three-man defence, a system he has felt comfortable using since the autumn, but he gave no hint that he would approach the Chelsea match  for which Kyle Walker and Jan Vertonghen are available after suspension  similarly. Well see, he said. The formation we choose to play is not important  most important is the animation and how we move the ball. Today was a game where, from the outside, we can see the players were enjoying playing football on the pitch. Most important is the idea, the philosophy, and what we want to do with the ball  I think you give too much importance to the shape.','sport'),(30,'Manu Tuilagi could not have worse luck if he throttled several black cats. Eight minutes into the sixth match of his latest comeback, he made a typical outside break that it took three tacklers to thwart but lay on the ground clutching his right knee and had to be helped off, little more than 24 hours after the Lions centre had been named in the England squad. His impact in possession was missed by the Tigers, who lacked a focal point in the tightest of matches and slumped to their second home defeat of the campaign. Instead of going to Brighton for a two-day training camp on Sunday night, Tuilagi had another visit to hospital to look forward to and a scan. At least his groin is fine, said the Leicester director of rugby, Richard Cockerill, referring to the problem that had played a large part in restricting the midfielder to 38 appearances in four seasons. He got a bang on the outside of his knee and these things need up to 48 hours. I saw him at half-time: he smiled and I laughed. We crack on, dont we? Crack was the word for Leicester, who tried going toe-to-toe with the most obdurate of opponents but tripped themselves up. In a match played in drizzle after a morning of heavy rain, the ball spent much of the time in the air, Ben Spencer, the day after he made Englands elite squad, getting the better of Ben Youngs, not least because of the protection he was given at the breakdown. Spencer had the time to hang his kicks and give his chasers every opportunity of either catching the ball or hitting the defender who had taken possession. Meanwhile Youngs was rushed into decisions by Maro Itoje, who capped another eye-catching performance by making an unusual charge-down, sliding in football style after Owen Williams had kicked with his left foot and getting the ball rather than his opponents ankle. Leicester achieved a surprising measure of dominance up front, Ellis Genge, looking to give the watching Eddie Jones a nudge after the head coach left him out of the national squad, and Dan Cole winning a succession of penalties in the scrum. But so convincingly had Saracens won the kicking game that only two were within the kicking range of Owen Williams. It was from a kick that Saracens scored the only try of the game after 54 minutes, seconds after Williams had hooked a 35-metre penalty that would have put the Tigers 12-6 ahead. As Leicester looked to play the ball on their own 10-metre line, Rhodes again showed his nuisance value and Youngs had not got the ball firmly in his grasp when he looped a pass to&nbsp;Williams. As the fly-half tried to take the ball above his head he was unnerved by the looming presence of Brad Barritt, who seized possession and set up a ruck. Saracens went left, where Owen Farrell used the threat of the 22st Will Skelton outside him to commit Mike Williams to cover the second row. That created a hole which Cole, standing inside Farrell, was never going to fill and the outside-half ran in from 30 metres for the score that came to be decisive. When Leicesters moment came 13 minutes from time, they lacked the same calculation. Barritts chip just inside Leicesters half was blocked by Jack Roberts and Tuilagis replacement Tom Brady carried the ball into Saracens 22 where, tackled by Alex Goode, he passed to Roberts outside him. The timing was wrong and Barritt tracked back to make up for his mistake. The two incidents marked a crucial difference between the sides and, while it was Saracens first league win here since 2013, Leicester have won only four of the last 17 Premiership meetings with the champions. Sarries closed the gap with the leaders, Wasps, to one point with a victory that was achieved without the Vunipola brothers and the England second-row George Kruis, who is unlikely to play again this month after suffering a broken cheekbone but is expected to be fit for the start of the Six Nations. Sarries kicking game helped compensate for the drop in rushing metres in the absence of the Vunipolas on a day when territory was king. Leicester took the lead on 10 minutes with the first of Williams four penalties but he missed two others, including one from just wide of the posts at the end of the first half when Leicester had for the only time in the match made their scrum dominance count near their opponents line. Cockerill reached for the word hindsight when asked if another scrum and with it the prospect of a penalty try would have been the better option, but Saracens, who lost Chris Ashton to a head injury in the second half, would still have found a way to win. The Tigers have been able for the most part to mask their shortcomings at home this season after being exposed away which is why the latest loss of Tuilagi is so cruel. He was in full flow, leaving Farrell grasping air and Marcelo Bosch hanging on grimly when Sean Maitland clattered the centre from behind and caught his right knee. Accidents happen to Tuilagi more often than most and England again look like having to prepare for a tournament without him.

Morocco  Three Moroccans were wounded, the MAP news agency quoted the embassy in Ankara as saying. Hello, Nicola Slawson here in London, taking over from Jamie. Heres an update from our correspondent, Kareem Shaheen, in Istanbul: One important question that has been raised is how the assailant managed to escape even though the police response was quite swift to the attack, since there is a police station just across the street from Reina. There are over 300 security cameras in the club and the surrounding area so investigators are combing through security cam footage. One theory, believed by some who have seen some of the footage, is that the attacker, who left his gun at the scene, may have pretended to be an injured civilian in the immediate aftermath and chaos. A manhunt is on for an attacker who shot dead 39 people and wounded 69 others during a New Years Eve celebration at an upmarket Istanbul nightclub. Turkish officials said it was a lone gunman but some survivors described seeing multiple attackers. A Turkish opposition MP said at least 24 of those killed were foreign nationals, higher than the 15 cited by Turkish interior minister Suleyman Soylu. CHP MP said 11 Turks, seven Saudi Arabians, three Iraqis, two Lebanese, two Tunisian, two Indian and a Kuwaiti, a Syrian, and an Israelis are among the dead. A Belgian citizen who is originally Turkish, and a Canadian-Iraqi were also killed, she said. The Jordanian foreign ministry said three of its citizens were killed. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack on the Reina club,which is thought to have had up to 600 people inside at the time. The club is an exclusive hotspot popular with tourists and local residents that sits on the bank of the eastern side of the Bosphorus. President Tayyip Erdoan said Turkey would fight to the end against all forms of terrorism. He accused the perpetrators of trying to create chaos, demoralise our people, and destabilise our country. Witnesses reported a rush for the exits, bodies lying on the floor and people jumping into the water to escape the gunman. One survivor said the gunman shouted Allahu Akbar (God is greatest) during the attack. There has been condemnation from across the world with the US State Department describing it as heinous and Barack Obama offering his condolences. The Russian president Vladimir Putin said it was hard to imagine a more cynical crime and Pope Francis said he was praying for the victims. Leanne Nasser, 19, from the Israeli-Arab town of Tira Nasser was killed while celebrating with three friends. Her friend Ruaa Mansour, also 18, was moderately wounded in the attack. The other two friends were unharmed. A Lebanese man, Haykal Musallem, was at the club with his wife of five months when he was killed, a friend said. A security guard at the club, Fatih akmak, Turkish police officer, Burak Yildiz, 22, and 47-year-old travel agent Ayhan Arik, were also reportedly killed. akmak reportedly survived twin bombings outside a football stadium in Istanbul on 10 December, which killed 45 people. Mehmet Grmez, Turkeys most senior cleric, has condemned the attack as savagery and a massacre that no Muslim conscience can accept. Conservative politicians and media who criticised the concept of New Year celebrations have come under scrutiny in the wake of the attack. An opposition politician called for those responsible for messages which can damage our social peace to resign. Frances foreign minister says one French citizen was killed and three others wounded in the New Years shooting attack at a crowded Istanbul nightclub, AP reports. Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said in a statement that a woman with both French and Tunisian citizenship died in the attack early Sunday. Ayrault says the womans Tunisian husband also died. Due to the presence of French citizens among the casualties, the Paris prosecutors office says it has opened a criminal investigation for terrorist murders and attempted murders. An assailant opened fire at the Reina nightclub during New Years celebrations, killing at least 39 people. Turkish authorities said foreigners from many different nationalities are among the wounded in the attack. French President Francois Hollande says in a statement that France will pitilessly pursue the fight against terrorism with its allies. Hi, Jamie Grierson in London here, taking over from Haroon. Heres some updated advice from the UKs Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). A brief statement on the departments website reads: On 1 January 2017, there was an attack on the Reina nightclub in Ortakoy, Istanbul, causing a large number of casualties. There is an ongoing police operation in Istanbul as a result of the attack, and the attacker may still be at large. You should exercise vigilance and caution at this time, and follow the advice and instructions of the security authorities. Charbel Wardini, from Lebanon, told AP that his 26-year-old brother, Elias, was among those killed in the attack. He said: I lost my brother because of terrorism. If you tell me terrorism, I will go fight against them. Lebanons state-run National News Agency said seven Lebanese were wounded in the attack. Lebanons foreign ministry reported earlier that the daughter of member of parliament Estephan El Douaihy was among those injured. The Lebanese government plans to send a jet to Istanbul on Sunday night with a medical team and relatives of the wounded in order to bring them back to Beirut. The foreign ministry in Amman has said three Jordanians were killed and four injured, the official Petra news agency reported. At the forensic institute in Istanbul, Kareem Shaheen spoke to Stephanie Deek, a Lebanese woman whose friend was with her husband, Haykal Musallem, at Reina when the attack happened. Musallem was killed. Deek said: They were just tourists, married for five months, and they wanted to find the perfect place to spend New Years Eve. She said when the attack happened the husband was in the bathroom and the wife at the table. She ran out when the shooting started but the husband was caught in the midst of the attack and died. Deek tried to contact them as soon as she heard of the attack, and was there to try and identify the body but had to wait outside and was visibly agitated. She said: Im feeling so sad. I cant even talk or express my feelings. Selina Dogan, a CHP [the main opposition party] MP who toured the hospitals and the morgue, said 11 Turks, 24 foreign nationals and four whose nationality has yet to be ascertained were killed in the attack. She said the nationalities of the dead included Saudi Arabian (seven) Iraqi (three), Lebanese (two), Tunisian (two) Indian (two) and one each from Kuwait, Syria, and Israel. A Belgian citizen who is originally Turkish, and a Canadian-Iraqi were also killed. One of the Kuwaiti wounded told visitors that the assailant was shouting Allahu Akbar (God is greatest). The survivors they spoke to all said there were multiple assailants, although Turkish authorities have said there was a lone attacker, and some said they were in contact with each other on walkie talkies. All of the dead had gun wounds caused by a Kalashnikov assault rifle. Of the dead, 25 are men and 14 women. Eleven bodies have already been handed over to their families for burial. Two of the dead are believed to be Saudi twins but they havent been formally identified yet. Five Saudi citizens were killed in the attack and 10 more injured, according to the al-Riyhadh website (Arabic link), quoting the countrys acting consul general in Istanbul. Another Lebanese man, Haykal Mousallem, was killed in the attack, his relatives have told Reuters. Earlier, the family of Elias Wardini told Lebanons New TV that they had been officially informed of his death. Lebanons National News Agency said several other Lebanese nationals were wounded in the attack. Turkish media say the victims of the attack include a police officer and a travel agent, AP reports. State-run Anadolu news agency reported that the body of 22-year-old police officer Burak Yildiz was en route to his hometown in the southern city of Mersin. Yildiz, who had been on the force for one-and-a-half years, was shot and killed outside the Reina nightclub. Private Dogan news agency reports that 47-year-old travel agent Ayhan Arik, a father of two, was another of the first victims of the early morning attack. The news agency says the gunman shot Arik in the head outside the club. The Turkish prime minister has also said the reports that the attacker was dressed as Santa Claus are untrue. Turkish authorities are starting to uncover evidence about the attack on the Reina nightclub but there is no clarity yet on who was responsible, Turkish prime minister Binali Yildirim said. When asked by reporters who might have been behind it, he answered: Some details have started emerging, but the authorities are working towards a concrete result. Police and security officials will share information as it becomes available during the investigation. Israeli, Lebanese, Libyan, Moroccan, and Saudi Arabian citizens were among 39 people killed when a gunman opened fire in an Istanbul nightclub during a New Years Eve celebration, Turkish authorities said. Another 69 people were injured. At least 15 of the dead are believed to be foreign nationals. Interior minister Sleyman Soylu said that the gunman was still on the run, contrary to earlier statements by authorities that the assailant had been killed. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack on the Reina club, which is thought to have had up to 600 people inside at the time. The club is an exclusive hotspot popular with tourists and local residents that sits on the bank of the western side of the Bosphorus. President Tayyip Erdoan said Turkey would fight to the end against all forms of terrorism. He accused the perpetrators of trying to create chaos, demoralise our people, and destabilise our country. The citys governor, Vasip Sahin, said the attacker, armed with a long-barrelled weapon, killed a policeman and a civilian outside the Reina club at about 1.45am before moving inside. Video footage showed an apparent assailant dressed in black, in contradiction to a report suggesting he was wearing a Santa Claus costume. Witnesses reported a rush for the exits, bodies lying on the floor and people jumping into the water to escape the gunman. The clubs owner said extra security measures had been brought in in the past 10 days after US intelligence reports suggested a possible attack on crowded places in the city. There has been condemnation from across the world with the US State Department describing it as heinous and Barack Obama offering his condolences.

Some of the marginal newspapers with a very conservative following like Akit and Milli Gazete published front page features yesterday on NYE celebrations. In Milli the headline was: This is the last warning, dont celebrate. In Akit, the front page said Down with your civilisation, with pictures side by side of people in Syria and people partying. An influential CHP deputy from Istanbul, Gursel Tekin, said at the hospital: In the coming days we should be talking about this - in the last week there were so many messages which can damage our social peace but none of these messages were investigated. Those responsible should resign. This is a list of terrorist attacks in Turkey since the summer of 2015, via the New York Times: This is the scene at Sisli Etfal hospital where wounded and survivors were taken last night. There are few families as the nightclub is a known destination for foreigners, so many of the casualties do nOt have family here. Many roads in the city are closed off as they search for the attackers. There are two foreigners at the hospital who are wounded and in a critical condition. There is also a wounded Turkish man who was shot in his spine and is getting psychological support and treatment. Opposition CHP lawmaker Akif Hamzacebe described the assault as an attack on a way of life and and said it was savage. The aim is to plant seeds of hatred among society, he said. We do not want to live with the acceptance of terror and the state should teach a lesson to the terrorist organisations. It is important to note that many conservatives prior to the attack were decrying the sinfulness of NYE celebrations and so some people see the attack as notable from a cultural point of view, hence the comment about it being an attack on a way of life, almost an attack on Turkeys secular character. An MHP lawmaker who visited the hospital described the dead as martyrs. Those who committed this action against the stability of the Turkish state will drown in their own blood, he said. The Reina nightclub has long been a magnet to the rich and famous, my colleague Robert Booth writes: Open since 2002, the venue on the banks of the Bosphorus has earned a reputation as the place to be seen among Turkeys young, secular elite who recline on its white banquettes and are served ice buckets of drinks by aproned waiters. It attracts footballers from the top Turkish sides and stars from the countrys popular soap operas, as well as tourists and businesspeople from around the world. Daniel Craig, Kylie Minogue, Naomi Watts and Jon Bon Jovi are among the celebrities named as having been guests at the club, according to GC Prive, a London wealth management company that recommends the venue to its clients. The funeral of Ayhan Arik, one of the victims of the attack at the Reina nightclub, has been taking place in Istanbul. Arik reportedly drove tourists to the club. Islamic custom is to bury people as soon as possible after their death. This video shows bullets ricocheting outside the Reina nightclub and a man who appears to be the attacker. It suggests that reports that the attacker was wearing a Santa Claus suit are wrong, as he appears to be dressed all in black. A number of people have said that the attack on the nightclub came amid criticism in Turkey of New Years celebrations from some who consider them incompatible with Islam. In his traditional New Year address, Pope Francis has urged leaders to work together to fight the plague of terrorism in the wake of events in Turkey. Speaking to 50,000 people in St. Peters Square, Francis departed from his prepared text to condemn the Istanbul nightclub attack that killed at least 39 people. He said: Unfortunately, violence has stricken even in this night of good wishes and hope. Pained, I express my closeness to the Turkish people. I pray for the many victims and for the wounded and for the entire nation in mourning. I ask the Lord to sustain all men of good will to courageously roll up their sleeves to confront the plague of terrorism and this stain of blood that is covering the world with a shadow of fear and a sense of loss. The pro-Kurdish HDP, Turkeys third largest party, has condemned the Istanbul attack: The US embassy in Turkey has sought to clarify the details of a travel warning it issued on 22 December, saying it had no information about threats to specific entertainment venues, including the Reina club, despite social media rumours to the contrary. Turkeys top cleric has said there is no difference between a terrorist attack on a place of worship or in an entertainment place. The Turkish family minister has said that Saudi Arabian, Moroccan, Lebanese and Libyan nationals were also among the victims of the attack The Israeli foreign ministry has said that an Israeli woman was killed in the attack. She is Leanne Nasser, 19, from the Israeli-Arab town of Tira. Nasser was celebrating with three friends at the Reina nightclub when the gunman broke in and opened fire. Her friend Ruaa Mansour, also 18, was moderately wounded in the attack. The other two friends were unharmed. The president of the European Commission has sent his condolences to Turkey. The UK government has updated its travel advice for Turkey in the wake of the attack. It says: On 1 January 2017, there was an attack on the Reina nightclub in Ortakoy, Istanbul, causing a large number of casualties. There is an ongoing police operation in Istanbul as a result of the attack, and the attacker may still be at large. You should exercise vigilance and caution at this time, and follow the advice and instructions of the security authorities. Turkish website the Daily Sabah reports that a man killed in the attack at Reina nightclub had survived twin bombings outside a football stadium in Istanbul on 10 December, which killed 45 people. It says that Fatih akmak was on duty at the nightclub during the New Year celebrations and was also working at the match between Beikta and Bursaspor last month. He escaped the bombing, which occurred after the match ended, unharmed, according to the Daily Sabah only to die in last nights attack. Human Rights Watch executive director Kenneth Roth has tweeted a map showing the number of deaths from terrorist attacks in Turkey over the past 18 months (Istanbul is in the north-west corner): Unsurprisingly, there is still a heavy police presence at the scene of the atrocity. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has joined in the international condemnation of the attack in Turkey. He said: It is hard to imagine a more cynical crime than the murder of innocent civilians in the midst of New Years holiday. But the terrorists are absolutely alien to the concept of human morality. Our common duty is to respond decisively to the terrorist aggression. President Tayyip Erdoan has vowed not to rest in the fight against all forms of terrorism. In a written statement, he said: As a nation, we will fight to the end against not just the armed attacks of terror groups and the forces behind them, but also against their economic, political and social attacks. They are trying to create chaos, demoralise our people, and destabilise our country with abominable attacks which target civilians ... We will retain our cool-headedness as a nation, standing more closely together, and we will never give ground to such dirty games. There has been condemnation of the attack from around the world. This is from the UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, who has Turkish ancestry but has lampooned President Erdoan in the past The foreign ministry of neighbouring Greece said: We unequivocally condemn the barbaric terrorist attack with numerous casualties that occurred in the nightclub in Istanbul. We express our full solidarity with the Turkish people and convey heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims and wishes of a speedy recovery to the injured. And this is from Israel, which has already said that an Israeli woman was injured in the attack and that another is missing. I am going to hand over the blog now to my colleague, Haroon Siddique. Many thanks to our readers and I hope the blog has proved useful. There are still many details yet to emerge about the motivation behind the attack, the whereabouts of the assailant(s) and of course the details of the victims. Below is a full report of where things stand at the moment. Mehmet Dag, 22, was passing by the club at the time of the shooting. He says he saw the suspect shoot at a police officer and a bystander outside, before going in. I was in shock at the scene, he said. Once he went in, we dont know what happened. There were gun sounds and after two minutes, the sound of an explosion. Israels foreign ministry has said that an Israeli woman was injured in the attack, and that another is missing. An Israeli woman was injured and hospitalised, but her life is not in danger, while there is no news of a second Israeli woman who was in the nightclub at the time of the attack, a ministry spokesman told AFP. Turkey is a popular tourist destination for Israelis, with tens of thousands visiting each year. At least 39 people have been killed, and 69 injured, in an Istanbul nightclub after a gunman reportedly dressed as Father Christmas entered and began firing at random during a New Years Eve celebration. Interior minister Sleyman Soylu said that of 21 victims identified so far, 15 were foreign nationals. Soylu said the gunman was still on the run, contrary to earlier statements by authorities that the assailant had been killed. The citys governor, Vasip Sahin, said the attacker, armed with a long-barrelled weapon, killed a policeman and a civilian outside the Reina club at about 1.45am before moving inside. Sahin described it as a terror attack but gave no further details. There have not yet been any claims of responsibility. It is thought up to 600 people were inside the club, an exclusive hotspot popular with tourists and local residents that sits on the bank of the eastern side of the Bosphorus. Witnesses reported a rush for the exits, bodies lying on the floor and people jumping into the water to escape the gunman. The clubs owner said extra security measures had been brought in in the past 10 days after US intelligence reports suggested a possible attack. Security has been increased across the city following the mass shooting in the district of Ortakoy. The US embassy has told its citizens to avoid the area and urged them to contact relatives to let them know they are safe. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoan, has been quoted by state-run news agency Anadolu as expressing his deep sadness. Mehmet Grmez, Turkeys most senior cleric, has condemned the attack as savagery and a massacre that no Muslim conscience can accept. Mehmet Grmez, Turkeys most senior cleric, has condemned the attack as savagery, horrendous. The action is a murder and a massacre, he said. Terror can never be accepted no matter by who or against whom it is committed. The only nuance, which differentiates the terrorist action committed tonight from others, is that it aims to divide the nation and confront people from differnet lifestyles by inciting them. Today is the day to unite as the whole national against any kind of terror. I strongly condemn the terrorists who committed this massacre that no Muslim conscience can accept. I wish mercy from Allah for the ones who lost their lives in the attack and speedy recovery for the injured. Justice minister Bekir Bozda issued a statement earlier, saying: No terrorist attack will break our unity. Koarslan also mentions that the attacker was using Kalashnikovs. This would support other witness accounts that the gunman was using multiple weapons. It is also the first detail that has emerged about the type of firearm used, other than Istanbul governor Vasip Sahins reference to the use of a long-barrelled weapon. Turkish newspaper Hrriyet has quoted Mehmet Koarslan, the owner of the Reina nightclub where the attack took place, as saying security measures had been brought in over the past 10 days after US intelligence reports suggested a possible attack. A bit more background on Istanbuls Reina club. The place is popular with Turkeys young, secular elite and is one of the most prestigious nightspots in the city. It is situated on the shores of the Bosphorus on the European side of the city and has a terrace that goes down to the waters edge. The most wealthy patrons arrive in boats to enjoy its several restaurants and dancefloors. Its parties are well known on the social circuit. Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg has issued his condolences. The US state department made in its response earlier a specific reference to Turkey as our Nato ally in the fight against terrorism. The health minister, Recep Akda, has also spoken, indicating four of the 69 injured are in a very serious condition and that the wounded also included several foreigners. Turkeys interior minister has lowered the number of foreign nationals killed to 15. However, it is worth noting that there are still more than a dozen victims who have yet to be identified. AP quotes Sleyman Soylu as saying of the five Turkish fatalities identified so far, three or four were believed to be employees working at the club. He says: This was a massacre, a truly inhuman savagery. He said it was believed the attacker left the club wearing different clothing to those in which he entered the club. It has been reported the attacker was wearing a Father Christmas outfit. Soylu said the attacker was believed to have been acting alone. Previous witness reports have suggested there might have been more than one attacker. Authorities earlier said the gunman was killed on site, so details remain unclear, about eight hours after the attack took place. The UKs Foreign Commonwealth Office and Australias Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have said they are working to determine if any of their citizens are involved in Sunday mornings attack. At least 39 people have been killed, and 69 injured, in an Istanbul nightclub after a gunman reportedly dressed as Father Christmas entered and began firing at random during a New Years Eve celebration. Interior minister Sleyman Soylu said that of 21 victims identified so far, 16 were foreign nationals. Soylu said the gunman was still on the run, contrary to earlier statements by authorities that the gunman had been killed. The citys governor, Vasip Sahin, said the attacker, armed with a long-barrelled weapon, killed a policeman and a civilian outside the Reina club at about 1.45am before moving inside. Sahin described it as a terror attack but gave no further details. There have not yet been any claims of responsibility. It is thought up to 600 people were inside the club, an exclusive hotspot popular with tourists and local residents that sits on the bank of the eastern side of the Bosphorus.

The US embassy has told its citizens to avoid the area and urged them to contact relatives to let them know they are safe. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoan, has been quoted by state-run news agency Anadolu as expressing his deep sadness over the attack More quotes have come through from the interior minister, Sleyman Soylu: Our security forces have started the necessary operations. God willing he will be caught in a short period of time. Some images have come through giving a view from the Bosphorus on to the Reina nightclub, inside which security officers can be seen. Soylu gave the figure of 16 foreigners dead after only 21 victims were identified. This means the nationalities of 18 more victims are yet to be established. The interior minister, Sleyman Soylu, has said the attacker is still on the loose. Earlier government reports stated there was a lone gunman who was killed by police. Soylu said the death toll was now at 39, with 16 of those being foreign nationals. He did not provide any information on their countries. A further 69 people are being treated in hospitals across the city. Agence France-Presse is reporting comments from the interior minister, saying that the death toll has risen to 39, including 16 foreigners. Professional footballer Sefa Boydas has told AFP how people fainted after they heard gunshots while others walked on top of people to escape the attack. Boydas, who plays for Istanbul club Beylerbeyi SK, said he had only been in the club for about 10 minutes with two friends before he heard gunshots and his friend collapsed in shock. Just as we were settling down, by the door there was a lot of dust and smoke. Gunshots rang out. When those sounds were heard, many girls fainted. He said people appeared to be crushed as they ran away. They say 35 to 40 died but its probably more because when I was walking, people were walking on top of people. He described the screams which he said drowned out anything said by the attacker or attackers. He uses the word they, which could support the notion that there was more than one assailant. Even if there were shouting, you wouldnt hear because the crowds screams were 100 times louder. Boydas initially tried to escape holding his friend but upon seeing her older sister faint, the footballer said his friend also passed out. Our Middle East reporter Kareem Shaheen has filed this report from Istanbul. He notes it is still unclear how many assailants were involved. While the authorities said one gunman entered the club and was later killed by police, witness testimony in Turkish media appeared to describe more than one attacker, heightening fears that at least one other gunman remained on the loose. At least 35 people have been killed, and about 40 injured, in an Istanbul nightclub after a gunman reportedly dressed as Santa Claus entered and began firing at random during a New Years Eve celebration The citys governor, Vasip Sahin, said the attacker, armed with a long-barrelled weapon, killed a policeman and a civilian outside the Reina club at about 1.45am before moving inside.

It is thought up to 600 people were inside the club, a hotspot popular with tourists and local residents that sits on the bank of the eastern side of the Bosphorus. Witnesses reported a rush for the exits, bodies lying on the floor and people jumping into the river to escape the gunman, who has been killed, according to a government spokesman. Security has been increased across the city following the attack in the district of Ortakoy. The US embassy has told its citizens to avoid the area and urged them to contact relatives to let them know they are safe. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoan, has been quoted by state-run news agency Anadolu as expressing his deep sadness over the attack The US embassy in Turkey has urged US citizens to avoid the area  the district of Ortakoy  in the wake of the attack. It said in a statement: We strongly urge US citizens in Turkey to directly contact concerned family members in the United States to advise them of your safety. It is worth noting the club is popular with tourists as well as local residents. There is no word as yet on the nationalities of those who have been killed, or indeed an exact death toll. The BBC is reporting a media blackout has been ordered by the Turkish government for security reasons. Security measures had been heightened in major Turkish cities during what has been a year marked by terrorist attacks. In Istanbul, 17,000 police officers were on duty during this weeks festive celebrations. Some were camouflaged as Santa Claus and others as street vendors, state news agency Anadolu reported. The state-run Anadolu news agency has quoted the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoan, as expressing his deep sadness over the attack. He is getting regular updates on the investigation and the casualties from the prime minister, Binali Yldrm. Kareem Shaheen is reporting a huge security presence in the districts surrounding Ortakoy, where the attack took place. Many roads have been closed off. The hugely popular Istiklal avenue  a pedestrianised area packed with shops, bars and cafes  is lined with many police cars and armed officers. The coast guard patrols the Bosphorus near the river frontage of the Reina nightclub. There were reports of partygoers jumping into the river to escape the gunman. Witness Sinem Uyanik has recounted her ordeal. She was inside the club and her husband, Lutfu Uyanik, was wounded in the attack. Before I could understand what was happening, my husband fell on top me, she said outside Istanbuls Sisli hospital. I had to lift several bodies from on top of me before I could get out. Turkey has been hit by a string of attacks in recent months, blamed on Kurdish militants and Islamic State jihadists. On December 10, 44 people were killed in a double bombing in Istanbul after a football match hosted by top side Besiktas. That attack, which targeted a police bus, was claimed by the Kurdistan Freedom Falcons (TAK) seen as a radical offshoot of the PKK. A week later, 14 Turkish soldiers were killed and dozens more wounded in a suicide car bombing blamed on Kurdish militants targeting off-duty conscripts also claimed by the TAK. In June, 47 people were killed in a triple suicide bombing and gun attack at Istanbuls Ataturk airport, with authorities blaming Isis. Another 57 people, 34 of them children, were killed in August in a suicide attack by an Isis-linked bomber at a Kurdish wedding in the southeastern city of Gaziantep. The US state department has strongly condemned the attack. Deputy spokesman Mark Toner said: We stand in solidarity with our Nato ally Turkey in combating the ongoing threat of terrorism. Sadly, this heinous attack is only the latest effort to kill and maim innocent civilians. These attacks only reinforce our determination to work with the government of Turkey to counter the scourge of terrorism. US president Barack Obama, who is on holiday Hawaii, has expressed his condolences and offered help to Turkish authorities. White House spokesman Eric Schultz said in a statement: The president expressed condolences for the innocent lives lost, directed his team to offer appropriate assistance to the Turkish authorities, as necessary, and keep him updated as warranted. Government officials have said there was one attacker and that he has been killed. Our reporter says police can be seen leaving the scene now, and emergency services activity is beginning to subside, which might suggest the immediate threat is over. Here is an image from 2015 of the Reina club, where the shooting took place. NTV television is reporting the assailant may still be inside the nightclub. This is an unconfirmed report. Armed police in riot gear, backed up by armoured vehicle, have sealed off the area. As many as 600 people were thought to have been in the club when the attack happened, at about 1.15am, broadcaster CNN Turk has reported. Some people jumped into the waters of the Bosphorus to escape and were being rescued by police. Istanbuls governor, Vasip Sahin, told reporters at the scene: A terrorist with a long-range weapon ... brutally and savagely carried out this incident by firing bullets on innocent people who were there solely to celebrate the New Year and have fun. Kareem has spoken to a witness who was inside the club at the time. He described the rush for the exits after someone came in and began firing multiple firearms. A brother of one of the workers inside Reina is waiting outside in the rain with his wife for any news. His brother lost his phone and they have been unable so far to get in touch. We hope he is fine. My sister called me with the news that there was an attack and we put on our clothes and rushed here. It was really hard because no taxis wanted to go here. Police arrived almost instantaneously after the attack began because the police station is just across the road from the club. The Reina is one of Istanbuls best-known clubs, situated on the Bosphorus right under one of the bridges linking the European and Asian sides. Footage has emerged that reportedly shows the assailant dressed as Santa. Details however are still far from clear. Earlier reports said there were two attackers. Witnesses are in the police station giving testimony at the moment so more details should soon emerge. It is just coming up to 4.30am in Istanbul. Our Middle East reporter, Kareem Shaheen, is at the scene of the attack. Police have sealed off the roads around the site as families arrive, seeking news of loved ones who were working at the club or visiting. There are a lot of tears. One woman rushed here because her nephew works as a bartender at the Reina club. She has finally just reached him on the phone. At least 35 people have been killed in a gun attack at a nightclub in Istanbul, the citys governor has said. Vasip Sahin said 40 other people were wounded in the assault which took place in the early hours of Sunday during a New Years Eve celebration. Sahin said the incident was a terror attack without saying who might have carried it out. The assailant shot a police officer and a civilian as he entered the club in the Ortakoy district before opening fire inside the building, Sahin said. There are many details that are still unclear, we will bring your further details as they come to light.','politics'),(32,'Bournemouth brushed aside Swansea City on New Years Eve and return to home soil hoping to close out a team at the opposite end of the table, Arsenal.

Much of the UK saw New Years Day downpours, but the rain will give way to a frosty start to the year as temperatures fall below zero as far south as the Chiltern Hills, where sleet and snow are possible. Temperatures are set to drop to their lowest point so far this winter, with forecasters predicting a possible -7C (19.4F) in Wales and the Scottish Highlands. Sophie Yeomans, a meteorologist at the Met Office, said: Weve got a cold front across the south of the country. The rain should clear, but moving in behind that we have a lot of cold air coming from the north. Its going to be very frosty at night and temperatures will drop below zero. A level two warning has been issued, which lasts until 3pm on Tuesday. Yeomans said: Cold weather alerts are given to let people know its going to be quite cold and they should put the heating on. There is also a yellow warning for across the north, Scotland and parts of Northern Ireland, which is to warn people about ice that could cause hazardous conditions on the roads. The lowest temperature for the UK at this time of year was -18.5C, recorded in Braemar, Aberdeenshire, in 1962. The weather is set to warm up slightly later in the week, but Yeomans said temperatures were only likely to rise by a couple of degrees. Public Health England also issued warnings about the upcoming cold spell. People were advised to turn their heating on, keep an eye on elderly neighbours and stay tuned to weather forecasts. Dr Thomas Waite of PHEs extreme events team said: Every winter thousands of people die because of their exposure to cold weather, and doctors surgeries, hospitals and other parts of the NHS are kept busy as people fall ill. Thats why its really important that we all do everything we can to ensure everyone stays well this winter. The elderly, very young and those with pre-existing health conditions are most at risk during cold weather. Keeping homes heated to at least 18C is a great way to avoid the health problems from cold, as is stocking up on food and medicine before cold weather sets in and wearing lots of thin layers, instead of fewer thick ones.','business'),(34,'Theresa Mays new year message urging unity and pledging to also represent the interests of remainers during negotiations with Brussels are empty words given her previous hardline approach, the Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, has said. In her video message May acknowledged how divisive Junes referendum had been and said both sides would be in her mind as she prepared to trigger article 50. I am there to get the right deal not just for those who voted to leave, but for every single person in this country, she said, counter to recent hints that the government is preparing a hard Brexit, which would see the country leave both the customs union and the single market. Farron, whose party is campaigning for a second referendum on any exit deal finalised with the EU, said: After months of platitudes and driving us headlong towards a hard Brexit out of the single market, threatening jobs and our economic security, a few empty words are utterly meaningless. If the prime minister cannot even deliver on the words she gave when she campaigned for remain, why should we believe her now? In all of this she has Labour holding her hand, marching towards a disastrous Brexit. In recent days, leave campaigners have stepped up efforts to push for what they term a clean break with Brussels, with the UK cutting all formal ties with the bloc. In a letter sent to the prime minister, the pressure group Leave Means Leave said leaving the single market and the customs union should be red lines for the prime minister. There must be no transitional deal on the key issues, the groups co-chairs Richard Tice and John Longworth wrote. The EU is renowned for its inability to secure trade deals within a sensible timeframe and the UK must be prepared to walk away and secure trade deals with the rest of the world if the EU fails to agree a deal in this timeframe.','politics'),(35,'The new year does not always guarantee a fresh start but Northampton may at least feel that their luck is turning. A match they rarely looked like winning was gifted to them when Gloucesters David Halaifonua was sent to the sin-bin for a deliberate knock-on and the Saints awarded a penalty try seven minutes from time. Stephen Myler could not miss the conversion on his 300th Northampton appearance but for Gloucester, who were leading by six points at the time, it was a bitter pill. Luther Burrells pass was heading to the replacement Harry Mallinder who had George North  back from his latest break following a head injury, outside him  but a try was not a certainty as Halaifonua attempted to intercept. Northamptons director of rugby, Jim Mallinder, felt that the referee, Matt Carley, made the right decision: We were going to score that. It was a clear overlap so it was the only decision the referee could make. His opposite number, David Humphreys, however, felt Ben Morgans disallowed try, when Gloucester were 9-3 ahead, was more costly. Were devastated. Its frustration, disappointment. We felt like weve been on the wrong end of decisions these last couple of weeks. Rather than focusing on the penalty try, Ben Morgan believes he was over the line but unfortunately there were not enough camera-angles to prove it. Until that point, it had been a match typical of both sides seasons. Northampton were at least spirited in defence  Courtney Lawes excelled at second-row  but they were helped by Gloucesters inability to take advantage of their territory and possession. It was, truth be told, a poor match, not helped by the dreadful conditions which considering the plight of these two sides in recent years, rather aptly left them stuck in the mud. Northampton, though, are up to sixth after back-to-back wins, can enjoy some good fortune after their latest travails with Dylan Hartley and the situation over their handling of Norths head injury, and may move up to fifth if they beat Bristol on Saturday. Im very pleased, I think it was a little bit of a dogfight, added Mallinder. We want to come down here and scrap for a win so its a very positive start, a very happy new year. North was conspicuous in the first half, only in so far as his white jersey was pristine throughout whereas his team-mates were covered in mud. It was not a day suited to wings but for club and country North is far too often on the periphery. His first touch came after 13 minutes, successfully claiming a high ball, but it was not until the stroke of half-time that he received a pass. Whether it is an inability to get him the ball, or an effect of his series of head injuries, it is a terrible shame. It was during this fixture a little more than three years ago when North produced a devastating burst of power and speed to leave defenders strewn all over the field and set up the Premierships try of the season, but he looks a shadow of that player at present, even if the coach was pleased with his contribution. [He is] really pleased to be back playing. Hes been training well and its good to see him out there, Mallinder said. Not [a day for wings] in terms of ball in hand and superb attacking rugby. But an important part to play and I thought he was safe in front of the high ball. Some of the handling on show was dreadful and not all of it can be blamed on the slippery ball, but Matt Kvesic shone for Gloucester in the first half and one thundering tackle on Kieran Brookes just before the half hour stopped Saints a metre short of the line. By that stage Gloucester had converted territorial dominance into only three points with a Billy Burns penalty from the left, but the fly-half added two more before the interval. Eight minutes into the second half Northampton were off the mark with a penalty for Myler in front of the posts. Gloucester responded and after their forwards had laid siege to the Northampton line the home side thought they had scored through Morgan in the left-hand corner only for replays to prove inconclusive. Myler then exchanged penalties with Burns but more handling errors let Gloucester down as they sought the try to put the match to bed. They could not find it and after a brief period of pressure from Northampton, Halaifonua digressed, and the match was snatched from Gloucesters grasp.

ITV Racings impressive roster of talent did not combine to make the powerful, confident first broadcast for which producers must have hoped as the channel ended its 30-year absence from the track but there were enough promising signs to suggest that future efforts will leave this first spin far&nbsp;behind. It was a brave decision to ditch the on-course studio employed by Channel&nbsp;4 and put the main presenters in the middle of the paddock and on balance it still feels like the right call, drawing the viewer right into the atmosphere of the days racing. Unfortunately, the atmosphere on New Years Day at Cheltenham was sopping wet. We want to go where the people at the track go, was the advance word from the editorial team, thinking of the paddock and the betting ring, but that laudable ambition was foiled as almost the entire crowd sought shelter in the racecourses sundry bars and bistros. Overhead shots showed that, most unusually, the steps around the famous Cheltenham winners enclosure were deserted while ITVs plucky front men stood alone, huddled under umbrellas. At least weve got a nice day for it, was the game beginning from Ed Chamberlin, poached from Sky Sports to be ITVs face of horse racing. He claimed to be with those noted former jockeys Sir Anthony McCoy and Luke Harvey, but that had to be taken on trust at first, their faces obscured by raindrops on camera lenses. Its wet, its miserable but its going to be terrific, we were assured, a promise backed up by a montage of clips from ITVs rich racing heritage, making early reference to Nijinsky and Lester Piggott, John Oaksey, Dickie Davies, Arkle and sun-soaked shots of Tattenham Corner. Then, deflatingly, came the first live action, a four-runner novice chase in which the expert commentary of Richard Hoiles was quite hard to hear for the first mile, because of the volume at which hoofbeats from the track were also played. The graphics, which seemed to use up only a portion of the available screen, proved hard to read and not just for this writer, judging by Twitter complaints. And just at the point when viewers may have begun to harbour doubts, Matt Chapman dropped a clanger during his betting ring beat by playing an impromptu game of hair or no hair with a bookmaker. Quite why anyone should be interested in what a middleaged man keeps under his bobble hat is hard to fathom. Chapman has waited an age for his debut on one of the main channels precisely because he has sometimes extemporised as oddly as this on At The Races, but he is self-aware and ditched some of the wackier stuff in recent years. Surely only an excessive desire to entertain can account for him going immediately off-piste on his ITV debut. He will not have impressed many of those unfamiliar with his work but he will get lots more chances. Hardly any racing broadcasters have his capacity to inform, provoke and engage, and perhaps he will give us a smoother run, now that the air is out of his tyres. As the programme progressed, Chapman fared better despite suffering as badly as John McCririck ever did from the sort of fools who want to shove themselves into an on-air shot. Chapman may eventually need a couple of heavies to keep such folk at bay. The best of this first ITV show was an affectionate portrait of the trainer Jonjo ONeill, making splendid use of archive film of his glory days in the saddle during the 70s. Youve been in racing for 50 years, the interviewer said. Sure, Im only a baby, ONeill replied with a smile. On this evidence, features are going to be a very strong point for ITV. Pre-race analysis needs some work but we can doubtless expect better when the quality of racing is stronger than it was here. The show gathered strength. Harvey did well to spot Daryl Jacobs foot slipping out of his stirrup as the jockey fought a close finish and lost. A camera in the weighing room caught Sam Twiston-Daviess reaction as he watched his younger brother, Willy, riding his first Cheltenham winner. McCoy had the best line, telling Chamberlin: In sport, anythings possible. Whod have thought of Leicester ruling the Premier League? Or that youd go from a nice, warm studio working with great pundits in Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher to standing out in the rain at Cheltenham with Luke Harvey and me? Indeed, there may be some mileage in giving McCoy the role of comedy curmudgeon, a series of surprise winners leading him to grouse that only the weather forecaster had got anything right. There certainly seems to be some creative tension between him and Chapman. We have survived, just, Chamberlin concluded. The social media response to his show was by then so varied that one news outlet called it the most divisive thing since Brexit. Now that everyone involved has been blooded, it may be a relief to move to the calmer backwaters of ITV4 for two months of low-key jump racing. By the time of the Cheltenham Festival in mid-March, we can all hope to see a more polished performance.','entertainment'),(37,'The latest battleground for the future of fracking in Britain looks set to be Sherwood Forest, the legendary home of folk hero Robin Hood and now the target of a seismic survey by Ineos. The chemical multinational, which relocated its headquarters back to the UK last month, appears to have agreed terms with the Forestry commission to start burying charges and spend up to two years using thumper trucks or vibroseis machines to search for shale gas. Campaigners have called on the government to block any possible fracking and protect the forest. According to documents obtained under freedom of information request by Friends of the Earth, Ineos could be working within 200 metres of the Major Oak, a 1,000-year old tree that in folklore sheltered Robin Hood and his merry men. Commercial fracking has yet to start in Britain, although Ineos and other firms have obtained licences from the government for shale gas exploration. The technology has been deeply controversial since tests conducted by Cuadrilla in 2011 caused earth tremors near Blackpool, but fracking operations are expected to restart in five wells in Yorkshire and Lancashire later this year. A small protest camp has been established at Kirby Misperton, North Yorkshire, at one of the wells where gas firm Third Energy has been given permission to start fracking. Guy Shrubsole, a Friends of the Earth campaigner, said he expected the move to search for shale gas under Sherwood Forest to become a new rallying point. He said: I cant think of anything more iconic in the English mindset to go for. Youd have thought theyd have learnt from the mistakes of some of the other fracking companies to avoid it, but theyve gone straight for it. Ineos told the Daily Telegraph that no decision had been made on whether fracking would go ahead under the national nature reserve, adding that any decision to position a well site will take into account environmental features such as the Major Oak. The firms shale operations director, Tom Pickering, said: Potentially we in the UK have a huge supply of indigenous gas under our own feet. It would be simply crazy not to explore this natural resource. However, Friends of the Earth fear that the seismic surveys alone could damage the forest, whose core is a site of special scientific interest, and its wildlife, which include rare bats and other protected species as well as ancient woodland. The Forestry commission has mandated that Ineos plants its charges at least 50 metres away from badgers setts and conservation sites. Ineos is a relatively new player in fracking, but was one of the big winners in the governmental handout of exploration licences, winning 21 of 159 awarded a year ago. The firm, founded by Jim Ratcliffe and with 17,000 employees worldwide, was welcomed back to the UK by the government last month as a vote of confidence in the UK economy, as it promised a $2bn (1.6bn) investment in businesses including shale gas. Other moves by Ineos to conduct fracking surveys in Nottinghamshire have been rebuffed. The National Trust refused the firm permission to conduct surveys in Clumber Park, a few miles to the north of the forest.','business'),(38,'As Russian diplomats expelled by Barack Obama left the US on Sunday, Donald Trumps incoming White House spokesman attempted to cast as a diplomatic triumph the president-elects controversial response to intelligence community reports that Moscow sought to influence the presidential election. Thats actually good for our country, Sean Spicer told ABCs This Week, referring to Russian president Vladimir Putins decision not to pursue immediate retaliation. So everyone wants to talk about the tweets that he sends, but I want to focus on the action that hes getting. Donald Trumps not president yet and hes getting action, successes and wins both abroad and here at home. Trumps decision to praise Putin, question intelligence findings and repeatedly say the US should move on places the president-elect at odds not just with the current White House, but with his own party in Congress. On Thursday, Obama ordered the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomatic personnel and the closure of estates in Maryland and New York used by embassy staff. The expelled personnel left Washington on Sunday, Reuters reported, citing a Russian news agency report. The plane took off, everyone has left, Reuters quoted the embassys press service as saying, from a report in RIA. On Friday, contrary to the view of his foreign ministry, Putin declined to respond to Obamas move, signalling that he would rather wait to gauge relations with the Trump administration. As is his wont, and to familiar uproar, Trump expressed his approval on Twitter. Great move on delay (by V. Putin), he wrote. I always knew he was very smart! On Sunday, Spicer, formerly chief strategist and communications director of the Republican National Committee, said Obamas measures were unlike any in modern history for any action and could prove too far-reaching. I think one of the questions that we have is, why the magnitude of this? he said. I mean you look at 35 people being expelled, two sites being closed down, the question is, is that response in proportion to the actions taken? Spicer and Trumps comments stand in sharp contrast to views held by Republicans in Congress. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said the White House had not yet dissuaded [Russia] from attempting to breach our cybersecurity systems, or harass our diplomats in Moscow. House speaker Paul Ryan called the sanctions overdue and an appropriate way to end eight years of failed policy with Russia. Leading Republicans have joined calls for a bipartisan congressional investigation. Arizona senator John McCain scheduled a hearing on foreign cyber threats for 5 January, and called senior intelligence officials to testify. On Sunday, speaking in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, McCain said: We will strongly urge our colleagues toward more meaningful and stronger sanctions against Russia because of their attack on the United States of America. Spicer also expressed concern that Obama had acted to Trumps political disadvantage and pointed to what he said was a lack of public response to Chinas hacking of the federal governments network in 2015, breaches that exposed sensitive information belonging to more than 22m federal employees and contractors. A White House statement wasnt even issued, Spicer said. No action publicly was taken. Nothing, nothing was taken. He added: So there is a question about whether theres a political retribution here versus a diplomatic response. In his own remarks to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate on Saturday night, Trump again expressed doubt over the US intelligence consensus regarding Russian breaches of Democratic party infrastructure. I just want them to be sure, because its a pretty serious charge, he said. If you look at the weapons of mass destruction  a reference to justification for the invasion of Iraq under George W Bush in 2003  that was a disaster, and they were wrong. Trump, who has long advocated for warmer relations with Russia, pressed his view that the US does not know for sure who was behind the cyber-attacks, which he has suggested could have been carried out by China, another state or someone sitting on their bed weighing 400lbs. Asked on Saturday about the reported discovery that Moscow could be behind malware found on a laptop owned by a Vermont electricity utility, Trump questioned the premise. It could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people dont know so we cannot be sure, Trump said, adding that more would be revealed on on Tuesday or Wednesday. The president-elect is set to meet intelligence officials this week, a meeting to which he agreed after the announcement of the Obama sanctions, despite repeating his wish for the American people to move on from the issue. Echoing his vague and much-discussed remarks earlier this week about security in the age of computer, he said his 10-year-old could do anything with a computer, advocated the use of couriers to transfer information, and said: I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove. Responding to Trumps comments, Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives intelligence committee, told ABC the president-elect stood alone in questioning the conclusions of US intelligence agencies. This is the overwhelming judgment of the intelligence community and, frankly, all of the members of the intelligence committees in Congress, Democrats and Republicans, Schiff said. None of us have any question about this. The only one who does, apparently, is Donald Trump. Schiff warned that Trump would face bipartisan resistance if he tried to lift the Obama sanctions. The reaction is going to be even more vigorous, Im convinced, in favor of stronger sanctions against Russia, Schiff said. Youre going to see Democrats and Republicans, like McCain and [South Carolina senator Lindsey] Graham and others, come together with a strong [congressional] sanctions package because frankly even though what the administration did was more than symbolic  it was very meaningful  it is not enough to deter Russia.','politics'),(39,'One state in which a Jewish government rules the entire territory from the Mediterranean to the Jordan and controls a Palestinian Arab population that equals the number of Jews is not the only option. There could be a single state of all its citizens, controlled by a democratically elected parliament and government in the interests of all its citizens (Kerry accuses Israel of undermining peace hopes, 29 December). This would not be a bizarre arrangement. In fact, all civilised nations apart from Israel are governed in this way. Your Q&amp;A section says that This would effectively be the end of the Jewish homeland, and thus unacceptable to the vast majority of global Jews and many others. First, the Jewish homeland was formed by taking the land of another people, the Palestinians. And most Jews today, as shown by their distribution around the world, have no need for a Jewish homeland. There is also no evidence to show that a single democratic state covering Israel, the West Bank and Gaza would be unacceptable. There are many Jews in the US and the UK who recognise that an ethnically defined state is an anachronism in the modern world. They see that a state of and for all its citizens is the only just route to peace. Even in Israel itself, where the grip of Judaism on the apparatus of state control is increasingly resented by many secular Jews, there is a growing one-state movement. The time has come to face the facts. The rightwing racists who run Israel in the face of all principles of democracy that apply in the rest of the world have to be removed by democratic means so that Israel and Palestine can be governed as one state in the way their citizens deserve. Karl Sabbagh Author, Palestine: A Personal History  The prime minister was absolutely right to criticise John Kerrys speech on Israel and settlements (Report, 30 December). First, it is legitimate to question why the US secretary of state found it so important to focus his final days in office on Israels settlement policy when so much of the world is in flames, so much of the Middle East is in ruins, and when much of that is a direct result of President Obamas and Kerrys failures in office. This selectivity in itself invites criticism on the grounds of a lack of even-handedness. Second, while one may disagree with Israels settlement policy (as many in Israel do), to suggest that settlements are the obstacle to peace is plainly wrong. Israel had to fight three wars for survival (1948, 1956 and 1967), long before there was an occupation or settlements. In 1967, Israels offer to return the territories, in exchange for peace  an offer embedded into UN resolution 242  was rejected by the Palestinians and Arabs. In 2000, Israel made generous offers to create a Palestinian state, but this too was rejected, and when Israel implemented a unilateral and complete withdrawal from Gaza (2005), all it got in return was a barrage of rockets. The real impediment to peace and to the two-state solution is that the Palestinians (and many Arabs) refuse to concede Israels right to exist. They do not dream of a state alongside Israel, but one in place of Israel. The issues are existential, not territorial. Had it been otherwise, the problem would long have been solved, just as it was when Egypt made peace with Israel in 1979. Joshua Rowe Manchester  Reacting to John Kerrys assessment that Benjamin Netanyahus government is the most rightwing coalition in Israeli history, Theresa Mays spokesman said she thought it was not appropriate to focus  solely on the issue of Israeli settlements and continued: The government believes that negotiations will only succeed when they are conducted between the two parties, supported by the international community. The fly in that ointment is that the present creeping annexation of Palestinian territory, while never-ending negotiations continue, suits the Netanyahu government. Without external pressure, such as trade and cultural sanctions on Israel, there is nothing to prevent the latticework that is Palestine from being eaten away to the point where it is as no longer viable as a state. Eddie Dougall Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk  In the international angst over Israel it is surely worth remembering those acts of generosity to beleaguered Jews shown by the international community: the Balfour Declaration of 1917, which favoured the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, followed by its implementation through the state of Israel in 1948. To this neutral observer things started to go wrong only when Israel decided in 1967 that it would no longer accept the borders provided for it 19 years earlier. That seems to have been the key action from which the whole tragedy has ensued. Somehow we need to find a way back to first principles on this matter.

Data and anecdote, backed up by doctors and trade unions, suggest the EUs most chaotic state is in the midst of a public health meltdown. In the name of tough fiscal targets, people who might otherwise survive are dying, said Michalis Giannakos who heads the Panhellenic Federation of Public Hospital Employees. Our hospitals have become danger zones. Figures released by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control recently revealed that about 10% of patients in Greece were at risk of developing potentially fatal hospital infections, with an estimated 3,000 deaths attributed to them. The occurrence rate was dramatically higher in intensive care units and neonatal wards, the body said. Although the data referred to outbreaks between 2011 and 2012  the last official figures available  Giannakos said the problem had only got worse. Like other medics who have worked in the Greek national health system since its establishment in 1983, the union chief blamed lack of personnel, inadequate sanitation and absence of cleaning products for the problems. Cutbacks had been exacerbated by overuse of antibiotics, he said. For every 40 patients there is just one nurse, he said, mentioning the case of an otherwise healthy woman who died last month after a routine leg operation in a public hospital on Zakynthos. Cuts are such that even in intensive care units we have lost 150 beds. Frequently, patients are placed on beds that have not been disinfected. Staff are so overworked they dont have time to wash their hands and often there is no antiseptic soap anyway. No other sector has been affected to the same extent by Greeces economic crisis. Bloated, profligate and corrupt, for many healthcare was indicative of all that was wrong with the country and, as such, badly in need of reform. Acknowledging the shortfalls, the government announced last month that it planned to appoint more than 8,000 doctors and nurses in 2017. Since 2009, per capita spending on public health has been cut by nearly a third  more than 5bn (4.3bn)  according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. By 2014, public expenditure had fallen to 4.7% of GDP, from a pre-crisis high of 9.9%. More than 25,000 staff have been laid off, with supplies so scarce that hospitals often run out of medicines, gloves, gauze and sheets. In early December Giannakos, a nurse by training, led a protest march, which started at the grimy building housing the health ministry and ended outside the neoclassical office of the prime minister, Alexis Tsipras. At the ministry, hospital technicians erected a breeze-block wall and from it hung a placard with the words: The ministry has moved to Brussels. Few advanced western economies have enacted fiscal adjustment on the scale of Greece. In the six years since it received the first of three bailouts to keep bankruptcy at bay, the country has enforced draconian belt-tightening in return for more than 300bn in emergency loans. The loss of more than 25% of national output  and a recession that has seen ever more people resorting to primary health care  has compounded the corrosive effects of cuts that in the case of public hospitals have often been as indiscriminate as they are deep. Pressure to meet creditor-mandated budget targets means that in 2016 alone, expenditure on the sector has declined by 350m under the stewardship of Syriza, the leftist party that had once railed against austerity, said Giannakos, citing government figures. More than 2.5 million Greeks have been left without any healthcare coverage. Shortages of spare parts are such that scanning machines and other sophisticated diagnostic equipment have become increasingly faulty. Basic blood tests are no longer conducted at most hospitals because laboratory expenditure has been pared back. Wage cuts have worsened the low morale. The biggest problem is shortage of staff because people are retired and never replaced, said Dr Yiannis Papadatos, who runs the intensive care unit of one of the three paediatric hospitals in Athens. Then theres the problem of equipment and, periodically, lack of supplies like gloves, catheters, and cleaning tissues. Small acts of heroism have done much to keep the broken system afloat: doctors and nurses work overtime, with donors and philanthropists also helping. Papadatos said: I was brought up partly in Kenya by parents who emphasised the virtues of helping others. These days I spend a lot of time going round asking friends, or the private sector, for help when our hospital runs out of supplies. The monitors we use to track heart rhythms, blood pressure, that sort of thing, were all donated. People like to give. It makes them feel good. Unionists argue that healthcare is an easy target because successive governments have refused to properly tackle tax evasion, the biggest drain on public coffers. In a rare public admission, the International Monetary Fund recently conceded that cuts had been so brutal basic public services such as transport and healthcare are being compromised. But at a time when the Greek debt crisis has flared again, after Tsiprass controversial announcement of a series of welfare benefits, there are many who fear worse is to come. One of them is British-trained Dr Michalis Samarakos, who believes that while the health system is in need of further reform it also runs the risk of running out of specialists and clinical trainees. Already there has been a massive exodus of doctors abroad, mostly to Germany and the UK, as a result of lack of opportunity. The best are leaving because their potential cannot be developed here, he said. I can see it teaching sixth-year students at Athens University, everyone wants a reference, everyone wants to go. Its become a growing problem. We dont have nephrologists, for example, because there are no prospects for specialists, either in or out of the system [in private practice]. Trainee doctors are the backbone of any hospital  without them hospitals cant function. Unless there is a big change, I worry greatly that things can only become worse.','business'),(41,'Trevor Masters (Reasons to be cheerful about the world in 2016, Letters, 31 December) thanks the Guardian for being here to help us retain our sanity in the coming year, and cites examples of content to back up the claim.

It is a paradox that he is now heralded in some quarters as the global champion of all those causes, which everywhere seem under attack. The key to understanding this contradiction is that the pope is not himself a liberal. He is a conservative with a small c, mistrustful of all grand schemes of human betterment, whether socialist or libertarian, and he believes in sin and the devil  as do most of his 1.2 billion followers. If conservatism stands for anything more than the remorseless pursuit by the strong of their advantage over the weak, it is a profound suspicion of the human capacity to be good, a belief, as Milton put it, that we shall never cease hammering from our flinty hearts the seeds and sparkles of new miseries for ourselves. This isnt the whole truth, but at a time when a world order seemingly based on rational self-interest is being consumed in greed and rage  including the plague of terrorism that Francis urged all to confront as it struck Turkey again  a little of Miltons grim scepticism is salutary; even, almost, hopeful. For the pope, a world order based on the unlimited satisfaction of individual wants is unattainable, and the attempt to reach it destructive of the world around us, and of the peace of our inner worlds. As he wrote 18 months ago in his powerful encyclical on the environment: When people become self-centred and self-enclosed, their greed increases. The emptier a persons heart is, the more he or she needs things to buy, own and consume. It becomes almost impossible to accept the limits imposed by reality. This attack was not confined to the one encyclical, but has been one of the most important themes of all his preaching, most recently in his New Year homily: The lack of physical (and not virtual) contact is cauterising our hearts and making us lose the capacity for tenderness and wonder, for pity and compassion. But, he continued, we are not interchangeable items of merchandise or information processors. We are children, we are family, we are Gods People. This is the development of a consistent line of Catholic criticism of the economists world that goes back at least as far as Pope Leo XIIIs 1891 Rerum Novarum, and arguably comes from the roots of western civilisation, in Aristotle and Aquinas. Catholic social teaching offers a coherent perspective on how the individual fits into society. It addresses directly the two great questions of our time: how the economy should be arranged to benefit everyone, and how our societies should treat the natural environment. Pope Francis has been an astonishingly eloquent advocate for human rights, for the environment, for peace and against the ravages of capitalism. He doesnt do fluffy. In fact, at times, he sounds like a pure revolutionary. We should be particularly indignant at the enormous inequalities in our midst, he wrote in his 2015 encyclical. We fail to see that some are mired in desperate and degrading poverty, with no way out, while others have not the faintest idea of what to do with their possessions, vainly showing off their supposed superiority and leaving behind them so much waste which, if it were the case everywhere, would destroy the planet. ... We continue to tolerate that some consider themselves more human than others. With a passion perhaps possible only to a South American, he loathes the turbocharged US model of capitalism unleashed by Ronald Reagan: he entirely rejects the idea that greed restrained only by self-interest operating through a market will make the world just or good. His Catholicism is almost the polar opposite to the dominant strains of white American evangelical Christianity. He unequivocally opposes torture and the persecution of refugees, and even the death penalty, which are all causes dear to religious Republicans. More Americans support torture as an instrument of government policy than do the inhabitants of Iraq, Sudan or Afghanistan. With a series of dramatic gestures  visiting refugee camps; taking migrants into the Vatican; publicly washing the feet of a Muslim woman  the pope has demonstrated that he wants his church to stand alongside refugees and migrants. As archbishop of Buenos Aires he would visit the slums  and take a bus to get there. These are gestures eloquent of a much deeper intent. They set him against much of the modern world and the regimes in both Moscow and Washington. But they have also aroused bitter and well-funded opposition within his own church. The Vatican is a deeply and perhaps necessarily reactionary organisation, but an intelligent conservative like Pope Francis knows when times have changed and when to adapt. A reactionary confuses the present with the eternal, and thus cant admit any change at all. The enemies around him Reactionaries must always lose in the long run. The world does change, and the change cant be forever denied. But within the Catholic church they can and sometimes do manage to hold their positions for centuries. This is the dilemma that the pope faces as he tries to help the church come to terms with feminism. The Catholic church is a deeply patriarchal organisation: no one ever called a pope the Holy Mother; at the same time it is dependent on women whose work and devotion sustains the whole edifice. The concessions to feminism that he proposes dont go as far as they might. He maintains the ban on women priests, and the complete opposition to abortion  although all priests may now forgive women who ask for it. But he has moved decisively to allow parishes to recognise some second marriages as real ones. He has been denounced for this by the reactionaries within the church as a heretic, a destructive progressive, and a man whose policies must lead to a historic schism and break with tradition. At the same time he has greatly disappointed progressives who had hoped for some shift in substance on the full acceptance of gay people and on the role of women in the churchs hierarchy. A champion of humanity Once more the apparent paradox dissolves in the light of the fact this is a conservative who believes that sin can corrupt anything, even, or perhaps especially, the church he heads. Church law and church rules can themselves become unrealistic schemes for organising society, as destructive in their dogmatic application as the precepts of Ayn Rand. His reactionary enemies, already praying and plotting for his succession, want a pope to proclaim absolute moral norms that prohibit intrinsically evil acts and that are binding without exceptions  which might sound reasonable until you realise they are not quoting a denunciation of war or slavery, but Pope John Paul II denouncing contraception. Yet in a world full of bewildering change, progressives as well as conservatives need to remember that moral absolutes exist and that there are some evils with which it is always wrong to compromise. Their form changes. A quarter of a century ago the Soviet Union fell. The attitudes that shaped the church then will not help it  or us  now. Global poverty, global greed, and the destruction of the environment are what threaten us today, and, however unlikely, Pope Francis is a champion of humanity against these evils.','politics'),(43,'There has been little festive cheer for Stoke after the fixture computer handed them trips to Anfield and Stamford Bridge in between Christmas and new year and despite flattering to deceive before losing both games, the visit of Watford gives them a chance to end on a high.

My imagination has failed me in identifying how bean-counting to such a degree benefits productivity. Suggestions welcomed.

If the process of screen exposure is harmful, any further discussion about content becomes superfluous. What conceivable rationale is there for engaging very young children with ICT screen technologies when it will inappropriately accelerate early child development, distort the natural development of the young childs delicate growing senses and displace equivalent learning achievable through real, embodied human interaction? Weve no idea what the long-term neurological, social and emotional impacts will be of exposing children to ubiquitous screen technologies; and until we do, a responsible precautionary principle is urgently called for, with any guidelines being evidence-based and grounded in reputable research.

Sean McAllister, a documentary filmmaker from Hull, said the Made In Hull event  a city-wide artistic installation around major landmarks  would show people that the city had hidden culture. A huge audience packed in to Queen Victoria Square to watch as stories of the city and its people over the last 70 years were projected on to nearby buildings. McAllister said: Were finally going to share our secret. If youre from Hull, we always knew we had culture, its just the world didnt know, so the secrets out. Finally weve had to let them in. In a way weve kind of had these doors up to keep everybody out of our culture. Its just for us, weve had it as a subculture but, damn it, weve finally had to open the door to the international world and let them in. They can come and see what weve been enjoying. From the devastating bombing during the second world war, to the disappearance of its fishing fleet in the 1970s due to the cod wars, to the decimation of its shipping industry, Hull has struggled during the last seven decades. Hull city council leader Stephen Brady called it a city that had lost its confidence. But he believes Hulls tenure as UK City of Culture 2017 will breathe new life into the city. Hull is the second city to be given this honour, following Derry-Londonderry four years ago. It was selected in 2013 from a shortlist which included Dundee, Leicester and Swansea Bay. More than 30m is being spent on the years events and 25m has been invested in revamping the city centre and refurbishing the Ferens Art Gallery and the citys main theatre. This, Brady says, is an attempt for the city to entice new businesses and employers who will bring their staff with them and create more jobs. The city recently secured a 310m commitment by the German-owned firm Siemens to build new offshore wind turbines in the city, creating up to 1,000 jobs. We did it with Siemens and we can do it again. We want people to stay here, we want there to be opportunities. This year is so important in so many ways, we need it to breathe life into Hull and keep it buoyant for future generations, he said. Brady, a former butchers boy who grew up in a three-bedroomed terraced house with his eleven siblings, says it was about time to change the conversation about his home city. He said: Hull is a city like no other, it is more like a large village. There is also the fact that it is the end of the line in terms of road and rail networks. There is essentially nowhere beyond, which gives it a very isolated feel. We needed something to keep people here, bring in new talent, jobs, employers. Getting this City of Culture status has been as sweet as a nut. Celebrations began in earnest on Sunday night with the official opening spectacular. Thousands of people lined the waterfront for a fireworks display to mark the beginning of Made In Hull, as its historic buildings become backdrops for projections illustrating and celebrating more than 70 years of the citys history. The crowd in the city centre square  where one of eight art installations will be located for the next week  chanted a countdown before a projection of a propeller was beamed on to the Ferens Art Gallery building. The crowd then fell silent as they watched Hulls history, from pilot Amy Johnsons solo flight to Australia in 1930 to the present day, projected around the square. Other installations in the Made In Hull event include Hullywood Icons, featuring local people recreating images from classic films, and a multi-screen and sound installation recreating the club scene in 90s Yorkshire. Sunday may be the official opening but the buzz began over the summer, when US artist Spencer Tunick convinced 3,200 locals to strip naked and have themselves painted blue for his trademark photographs around Hulls landmarks celebrating the citys relationship with the sea. Other events planned over the year include a visit by the Turner prize, plus a one-off gig from David Bowies old backing band, the Spiders from Mars. Brady, 70, who has been council leader since 2011, admits that some may have trouble coming to grips with some of the wackier installations, but he will be gritting his teeth and trying new things. Hull has ambitions to become the next Liverpool, which reinvented itself following its year as European Capital of Culture in 2008. The status earned the city bumper visitor numbers and a multimillion-pound boost to its economy. The festival year saw 9.7m visitors to the city, an increase of 34%, and generated 753.8m for the economy. Brady said: The perception of Liverpool was forever changed after its city of culture year and thats what we are hoping for here. We dont want to return to our sleepy old times again  we want others to say it is a wonderful place that they will return to again and again. So far, there have been upgrades to streets and public buildings in Hull city centre. The improvements include the makeover of Humber Street in the old Fruit Market, where galleries and other artistic businesses are based. A 700,000, 350-seat outdoor theatre will also be built in the citys disused Central Dry Dock. One of its most famous sons, the poet Philip Larkin, once said it is a city that is in the world, yet sufficiently on the edge of it to have a different resonance. Brady said: We are not a people that shout loudly or sing our own praises like others. We quietly go about our own way. But now those barriers are coming down and we will not disappoint. Forthcoming events With a budget of 32m, there is expected to be a blizzard of arts and culture in the city over 365 days. These are some of the events taking place in the first three months.

For the way forward is not one nationwide progressive alliance, but rather multiple progressive alliances. To achieve an overarching national agreement is probably impossible. But progressive alliances can and already are forming  in individual parliamentary seats, across counties, across cities, sometimes at a council level, sometimes at parliamentary level. Theyll have different compositions in different places, according to local circumstances, but will be all the stronger for that, and more resilient. If talks break down or promises are broken in one place, it wont bring the whole edifice down. As for what it is for: getting rid of the Tories is a worthy goal, but a bigger, and even more important, prize is getting a fair voting system; electoral reform that will finally give Britain a democracy, a government that reflects the will of the people. Neatly, that would then remove the need for electoral alliances, for a PR-majority parliament, with a genuine will to act, only needs to be achieved once. Thats a prize worth sacrifice and political pain along the way. Natalie Bennett Former leader, Green party of England and Wales  In your interview (29 December), Jeremy Corbyn claims the victory in a council byelection in Telford on 8 December was evidence that Labour can perform well after the setbacks of Richmond Park and Sleaford. Only Telford was evidence of one thing: the progressive alliance in action. Labour almost certainly won the seat for the first time ever because a local deal was negotiated with the Greens and the Lib Dems, neither of whom stood a candidate. All the anti-Tory votes had one candidate to back and that Labour candidate won. The lesson is not that Labour can win alone, but that working together, the progressive parties can stop the Tories and introduce a new form of politics with the introduction of proportional voting. Will Jeremy and Labour learn that lesson in 2017 or keep on losing?

Pop open a computer science journal on your laptop during 2016 and youd be assured that not only was progress happening, but it was doing so much, much faster than predicted. Today, AI and algorithms dominate our lives  from the way financial markets carry out trades to the discovery of new pharmaceutical drugs and the means by which we discover and consume our news. But, like any invisible authority, such systems should be open to scrutiny. Yet too often they are not open and we are not even fully aware that such systems play the roles they do. For years now, companies such as Amazon, Google and Facebook have personalised the information we are fed; combing through our metadata to choose items they think we are most likely to be interested in. This is in stark contrast to the early days of online anonymity when a popular New Yorker cartoon depicted a computer-using canine with the humorous tagline: On the internet, nobody knows youre a dog. In 2017, not only do online companies know that were dogs, but also our breed and whether we prefer Bakers or Pedigree. The use of algorithms to control the way that were treated extends well beyond Googles personalised search or Facebooks customised news feed. Tech giants such as Cisco have explored the way in which the internet could be divided into groups of customers who would receive preferential download speeds based on their perceived value. Other companies promise to use breakthroughs in speech-recognition technology in call centres: sending customers through to people with a similar personality type to their own for more effective call resolution rates. It is a mistake to always decry this kind of personalisation as a negative. The futurist and writer Arthur C Clarke once noted that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Most of us will have had the awed feeling of watching a really good magic trick when their smartphone uninvitedly pops up a relevant piece of information at just the right moment  like your iPhone remembering where your car is parked. But the feeling is often tempered by a moment of doubt. Is it a bit creepy that Google knows your favourite football club? Are we being shown only the news that matches Facebooks vision of who we are? Most of the time we dont know because the algorithms internal workings remain inaccessible to us. The academic Sherry Turkle makes an interesting observation about PCs in the 1980s, when families started buying home computers and endless lines of green text gave way to sumptuous graphical user interfaces. At this point, she has suggested, computers moved from being a hobbyist machine you could open up and physically tinker with to a machine you could learn to operate immediately, even if you didnt know exactly how it was working. Computers, Turkle playfully noted, begged to be taken not at face value but at interface value. It doesnt take much to see that this philosophy has continued to develop over the years. This is particularly true when talking about artificial intelligence systems. Some of todays most impressive advances in fields such as machine learning (the goal of getting a machine to, well, learn) rely on tools such as deep learning neural networks. These are systems patterned after the way the human brain works but which, ironically, are almost entirely inscrutable to humans. Trained with only inputs and outputs, and tweaking one or the other until the middle part just works, human creators have long since sacrificed understanding in favour of results. Since such tools will increasingly be used for more complex use-cases such as AI-driven warfare, prioritising patients in hospital and determining which areas of a city should be most heavily policed, questioning them is essential. We may view computers as coolly objective  hence the sci-fi trope of the machine that gains emotions and then goes wrong  but human bias and error can enter into algorithms, too. Its when we believe that such systems are beyond question (and lack the means to question them if we change our mind) that things get problematic. So whats the answer? This is a more complex challenge than many of the over-the-air quick fixes Silicon Valley loves to engage with. You can cut down on speech you dont like on Twitter by banning people who say things you dont agree with. Thats not so easy when the positives and negatives of technology are so deeply entwined. Technology in this sense is a bit like the political system: there are so many decisions to take that we hand the overwhelming majority of them to someone we trust. There is some evidence to suggest things are changing. The issue of AI accountability is shaping up to be one of this years hot topics, ethically and technologically. Recently, researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technologys computer science and artificial intelligence laboratory published preliminary work on deep learning neural networks that can not only offer predictions and classifications, but also rationalise their decisions. Artificial intelligence achieved a lot in 2016. One of the goals in 2017 should be to make its workings more transparent. With plenty riding on it, this could be the year when, to coin a phrase, we begin to take back control. Luke Dormehl is the author of Thinking Machines: The Inside Story of Artificial Intelligence and Our Race to Build the Future','tech'),(49,'It was the sort of move that is more routinely associated with the skill buttons on the PlayStation. But when Olivier Giroud blurred the line between the virtually real and the gloriously tangible, he did more than set Arsenal on their way to victory over Crystal Palace. He lit up the Emirates Stadium and provided a memory for years to come. Girouds 17th-minute opener recalled the finish of Henrikh Mkhitaryan for Manchester United against Sunderland on Boxing Day. There were shades of a scorpion kick, albeit with only one leg; a rainbow flick or whatever else the gamers want to call it. But when Girouds back-heeled flick  recalled from a distance behind him and on the run, too  arched in off the underside of Wayne Hennesseys crossbar, the stadium and the watching TV millions felt their jaws drop. Even Giroud looked a little stunned. Arsenal coasted to the points thereafter, with Alex Iwobi providing the tempo and incision in the No10 role in the absence of Mesut zil, who was ill. Iwobi added the second goal; a looping header after Palace had left him unmarked only four yards out. Palaces defending continues to be a cause of high anxiety. Sam Allardyces team had a brief flurry around the hour mark but it was not an afternoon when the clubs new manager could trumpet too many positives with any conviction. It said much that he substituted Yohan Cabaye, Andros Townsend and Christian Benteke well before the end, with one eye, perhaps, on conserving energy for the home game against Swansea City on Tuesday. Girouds goal transcended the occasion and if the finish was a thing of exquisite class, it was worth going over every detail of the buildup, including the strikers role in it, which was crucial. After Lucas Prez  who looked off the pace on a rare Premier League start  had slid in to intercept on the edge of his own area, Hctor Bellern initiated the break with a sharp pass up to Giroud but it was what happened next that really got Arsenal moving. With his first back-heel, he found Granit Xhaka and he played in Iwobi who, in turn, made the right pass forward to Alexis Snchez. Giroud had bolted up in support but, when Snchezs cross arrived, it was a full yard behind him. No problem. Giroud adjusted his body shape and, in a moment of improvisational genius, he had reached back his left boot, located the ball and flicked it with his heel over his head and towards the roof of the net. Hennessey could do nothing to keep it out. The first thought was of Mkhitaryan but Giroud was further out than the United forward  he was about 12 yards from goal  and the goalkeeper had looked better placed. As the Arsenal supporters who filed past the press box were also keen to point out, Giroud was onside; Mkhitaryan had been just ahead of the last man. Whatever the arguments, it was plain that Giroud had illuminated this game to a degree that went beyond merely shaping it. In classic Giroud and Arsenal style, he had been guilty of a bad miss from an easier chance on seven minutes, after Xhakas dinked pass out to Nacho Monreal and the full-backs low, first-time cross. In front of goal, Giroud could not set his feet in time and Mohamed Elnenys follow-up shot was headed away by James Tomkins. Giroud had sorted himself out by the time that Snchez crossed for him shortly afterwards. It was only Girouds second Premier League start of the season but he now has five goals in the competition and the statistics show that they have come at a rate of one every 69.8 minutes. The next best record in the top flight belongs to Watfords Stefano Okaka, who has scored once every 97.5 minutes. Arsenal called the tune and it said everything that when Cabaye had a shot on target in the 37th minute, which was the definition of routine for the Arsenal goalkeeper, Petr Cech, the travelling fans celebrated wildly. Weve had a shot, weve had a shot, they chorused, sarcastically. Palaces chaotic streak at the back, which Allardyce has been charged with stamping out, was evident in first-half stoppage time, when a Bellern cross sparked such panic that the only surprise was the Keystone Cops did not arrive on the scene. With Martin Kelly all over the place, Iwobi won the ball and Snchez had a chance from close range. His shot, though, was too close to Hennessey, who blocked. Arsne Wenger would lament his teams failure to kill the game sooner than they did. Palace were poor in possession in the first half but they had what Allardyce described as our defining moment on 47 minutes, when Townsend crossed for Benteke and one of the best headers of a ball in Europe found himself up against Bellern at the far post. He failed to get a clean connection and the effort bobbled wide. The visitors had their purple patch after Iwobis goal, which followed Monreals cross and Scott Danns diversion high into the air. Benteke worked Cech with a header from a corner and Cabaye went close with the follow-up while Kelly swung and missed when well placed and Cech was made to save by Townsend. This game, however, was all about one player and one moment.','sport'),(50,'My husband Richard Baker, who has died aged 66 of cancer, was a sailor, museum attendant, writer and gardener and, for more than 30 years, lead builder of the Skinningrove bonfire, east Cleveland. Thousands flocked annually to his beautiful, enormous sculptures of dinosaurs, goblins, ships, castles and more, built from scrap wood at this spectacular community event. Richard invited contributions from everyone, whatever their abilities, encouraging people to value their addition, as he did. When darkness falls on Skinningrove each 5 November, this huge fire is a magical sight. In 2015, it featured as the Guardians Picture of the Day. The son of a naval officer, Christopher Baker, and his wife, Jean (nee Crabtree), Richard was born in Dunfermline when his father was stationed at Limekilns. When his father was posted to New Zealand, the family spent three years living near Takapuna beach. They returned to Blakeney, Norfolk, and then settled in nearby Cley. Richard went to school in Blickling, then boarded at King Edward VII grammar school, Kings Lynn, before embarking on a degress in English and American studies at Nottingham University. On graduating he became a contributor to alternative publications and later he wrote about English street life, using Hogarths drawings as his starting point. Richard and I met in 1974 at Theatre Centre, Kensal Green, north-west London, where we were both community arts workers. We were briefly engaged in that year, but did not marry until 2003. Between 1979 and 1993 we were based in Stockton-on-Tees and began visiting Whitby, which we grew to love. We started the Skinningrove bonfire along with local people in 1980. When my work took me around the country, Richard would often find new things to do too. He was, by turns, a proofreader, shepherd, barman, beach cleaner, clown, busker, musician, roadie, gardener and maker of giant puppets. In 1993, we moved to Dawlish, in Devon, but continued to return to the north-east to build the bonfire. We finally retired to Whitby in 2007. Richard was a well-known Church Street character and guide on ghost walks; he was in his element as a performing storyteller. He also worked in the Captain Cook Memorial Museum. When he saw the replica ship HM Bark Endeavour on its return to Britain in 1997 it was love at first sight. Richard sailed 1,000 miles as crew on six tall-ship voyages, three on the Endeavour replica in the early 2000s. He wrote poetry until his death, arranging his final pamphlet for distribution at his funeral in St Marys church, near Whitby Abbey. Richard is survived by me, and by his brothers, Timothy and Philip, and sisters, Diana and Teresa.','entertainment'),(51,'My father, Mohammed Ramzan (Abu), who has died aged 79, was a community activist and religious teacher in the Sufi tradition. In 1969 on a trip to Pakistan he met Barkat Ali, a former British Indian Army officer who had renounced the world, vowing to live the life of a fakir. Barkat Ali began a movement, Dar-ul-Ehsan (House of Blessings) with three aims: selfless service to all without discrimination, zikr or the rhythmic chanting of the names of Allah in communal worship and the active communication of Islam in what he considered its true form. Abu became his murid (disciple) and was appointed Barkat Alis representative in the UK. Abu was born in the village of Babyam in Kashmir, then part of British-controlled India, to Alma Bi and Mohammed Hussain, who were subsistence farmers. In 1960 his region was submerged and populations displaced to enable the development of the Mangla Dam, a major hydro-electric project. Young men were offered visas to Britain to help fill the labour shortage. Abu arrived in 1962 and drove buses in Newcastle upon Tyne. However, early bouts of ill-health made him question his migration, and his search for meaning eventually led him to Barkat Ali. In 1973 he moved to Watford, Hertfordshire, where his mission really began. He campaigned for a mosque for the small Muslim community. His profile led to a racist attack while he was working as a local station ticket collector. Undeterred, he continued conveying the teachings of Barkat Ali and introducing Islam to local authorities, schools, prisons and interfaith groups. Since Sunni Islam has no priesthood, in the pre-internet age Abus pastoral mission changed lives. Many second-generation British-born Muslims, increasingly alienated by their parents values and finding no solace in mosques, turned to Abu for spiritual guidance, counselling and religious instruction. He had charisma and, unusually for his generation, he spoke fluent English without the subcontinental twang; young people felt a connection. The front-room of our small terraced house was the centre of Abus life. On its carpet he would sit, patiently listening, rolling his tasbih (prayer beads) in silent zikr, as individuals talked through their problems. Often we would host groups of people, of all sorts, and Abu would engage them in discussions on diverse topics. This would be followed by a meal of freshly baked chapatis and dahl, washed down with tea (all prepared by my mother Walit). While he was firmly within the orthodox Sunni tradition, Abu differed from other Sufis in seeing no use in retreating from the world, thriving instead on robust discussion and frank, good-natured exchange. He had an ecumenical streak and was inspired by and sought to build bridges with the Shia branch of Islam in particular. From 1980 until his retirement in 1998 he worked as a bus driver for the local college and was a familiar sight in Watford with his distinctive long beard and khaki prayer cap. His job suited him, he often said, because his appearance was a great conversation-starter. Abu is survived by Walit, whom he married in 1965, their daughter, Tahira, and three sons, me, Azeem and Omar, and seven grandchildren.','politics'),(52,'If theres one thing 2016 taught us its that political predictions are a mugs game. Predictions about technology and society, however, are at least a little easier. One thing thats going to rub up against our noses during 2017 is the imminence of the driverless car revolution, which is going to be a big one. Around our house there is a new noise. Its my voice, in a tone of authoritarian command, saying: Alexa, stop! Or perhaps, Alexa, play the Beach Boys; or Alexa, whats the weather like tomorrow? Yes, like thousands of others, I got the new Amazon toy for Christmas  a small cylinder that can answer many questions with enormous speed and proficiency, play music, order taxis, dictate recipes and much else besides. Yet Alexa, already transforming life in my household, is nothing compared to the changes that driverless cars are going to visit on us very soon. Not long ago this was science fiction, but in 2016 we saw them tested on the streets of Milton Keynes. Meanwhile, in San Francisco, a row between Uber and the state of California over licences saw driverless cars removed from the streets and the first fatal car crash in the US involving a car on autopilot. Next year the UK government hopes we will see trials of driverless cars on British motorways. So its time for some serious thinking about whats coming down the fast lane in 2017. Lets start with the positives. First, quite a lot of people who would be killed or maimed on the roads if we carry on as we are will be saved. It may seem counter-intuitive, but almost all studies on properly equipped driverless cars suggest they are safer than those driven by humans. There is an additional safety advantage for women, who worry about late-night taxi rides. A driverless car might seem a sinister invention to some people  but it isnt going to rape you. Driverless cars should also greatly improve the urban landscape. We have become used to the ugliness of almost every street being choked by parked vehicles, but there would be almost no point in most of us owning a car. The cost of a cab ride is mostly made up by paying the driver, and therefore local rides would be dramatically cheaper. It will seem outlandishly extravagant to blow tens of thousands of pounds on buying a piece of equipment you can hire whenever you need it for far less. Petrolheads on a Jeremy Clarkson kick will still want to own their cars, but for most people this will be a big saving. So our streets will be clearer. And, because these will be electric cars, cleaner too. There will have to be vast new infrastructure systems  huge garages to store the cars so they can arrive quickly when ordered. I wonder whether local train services will survive. We may see a return to the Thatcherite proposal for railway lines to be turned into roads, this time for driverless cars. As for buses, at the moment we have a largely undiscussed transport apartheid between car owners and bus users. But if driverless cars work then surely there will be driverless buses, which can be a lot smaller and more numerous than todays diesel-spewing vehicles. At the other end of the scale, car sharing and car pooling, already popular, will expand: the distinction between somebody using a driverless minibus and driverless, large shared car could become meaningless. Put all this together and I can imagine car ownership, and car driving, being frowned on as much as opening a packet of fags at a family gathering is now. But lets turn to the dark side of this. First, the effect on jobs. There are just under 300,000 HGV drivers licensed in the UK and about the same number of licensed taxi and cab drivers in England and Wales. But these figures are probably an underestimate of the actual numbers of professional drivers, given the black/grey economy and the local delivery drivers. Putting all this together, I wouldnt be surprised if there were around a million people across the UK dependent upon driving others, or goods, or takeaways for their living. But the numbers are only the half of it. In an age of job insecurity, driving has become the default way that many people, particularly men, keep their heads above water. If you cant find anything else, sign up with a local cab firm and spend long hours on the streets. So the effect of this version of job destruction will be harsh, and require redistribution. Who will be the huge gainers from the driverless car revolution? Presumably the biggest car companies, and those at the forefront of the technology  Tesla, Mercedes, Honda  and the taxi companies, like Uber. Both can expect to make gargantuan profits. How do you channel some of that money back into the economy to provide jobs for the former drivers? Thats the old question about the taxation of multinationals. I dont see&nbsp;any chance of our society running out of things for human beings to do  not with the care crisis, or the needs of&nbsp;the NHS, or the almost endless amounts of environmental work to be done. Its about funding, by effectively taxing the new profits. There are also safety issues. This entire system depends upon the internet. A terrorist attack, or even a large solar flare, could knock everything out. The more interconnected we are, the more vulnerable we are. This is such a huge issue I would expect it to be a major political question&nbsp;for the year ahead. As with most technological advances, driverless cars will be a wonderful future or a looming disaster, dependent on the political choices we make. That, at least,&nbsp;hasnt changed. Has it, Alexa?','politics'),(53,'Can films be inspirational? Well, the good ones all are. And, in a broader sense, going to the cinema is a narcotic, luxurious experience that makes you feel inspired, uplifted and stimulated. But when people talk about inspirational films  underdogs achieving spectacular sporting success, charismatic teachers winning over pupils, people overcoming disabilities  I am sometimes a bit agnostic. An inspirational film often feels soupy and syrupy, schematic and cliched, faintly coercive and reactionary. Inspirational means aspirational, no arguments  and it brings out my ironic, grumpy Brit. When Im asked for my favourite inspirational scene, I nominate Tom Courtenays final, miserable act of defiance in The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner. One movie that was lauded as inspirational, The Blind Side, features Sandra Bullock in an Oscar-winning performance as a well-to-do Christian Republican mom in the Sarah Palin mould. She takes in a troubled African American teen and helps mould him into a top football player. This was a huge hit in 2009, with great swathes of America undoubtedly deeming it to be inspirational (perhaps the inspirational movie is itself an American genre). Personally, I felt it unwise to leave the sick bag beyond arms length. The same goes, incidentally, for Clint Eastwoods terrible Invictus, about the South African Springboks earnest battle for the 1995 Rugby World Cup, under the kindly eye of Nelson Mandela. I like Rocky as much as anyone, but Im quite sure Raging Bull, with its dark, mysterious poetry of defeat and survival, is in a different weight class. And there is something inspiring in the final audacious quotation from the Gospel of St John: All I know is this: once I was blind and now I can see. Yet sometimes films are genuinely inspirational, specifically because they dont indulge irony or nuance (it could be that inspirational, like comedy or romcom, is a genre that isnt critically acceptable). I have a soft spot for that fierce heartwarmer, The Pursuit of Happyness, directed by the Italian master of dolce, Gabriele Muccino, and starring Will Smith. It is a true story about a guy called Chris Gardner who once faced poverty as a jobless single dad, got an unpaid internship at a prestigious firm, and had to keep up appearances alongside the pampered yuppies competing for a permanent job, while he and his son slept in hostels or even subway toilets. Yes, its treacly and unashamedly premised on the idea of material success, the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. But its forthright and well made. It doesnt exactly inspire you, but it is touching and successful in its sentimental-euphoric inspirational mode. In this vein, I have to give credit to a sweet and good-natured movie based on a true story: October Sky, with Jake Gyllenhaal as a grim-faced coalminers son who is inspired by Russias Sputnik to go into rocket science when he leaves school. As for the inspirational-teacher films such as Good Will Hunting and Dead Poets Society, again I am agnostic. They garnered a lot of awards-season euphoria, but I am not sure they have aged well. They certainly show that Robin Williams was the King of Inspirational, in the same way you might call Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly the King of Song and Dance. Something in his hyperactive funniness  vulnerable, secretly wounded, dripping with empathy, morally strong  made him the incarnation of inspirational: the teacher figure who wasnt distant or fierce, but often a kind of rocket-fuelled version of the class clown who was on the kids side. Williams did this so well that he was never quite convincing in the darker roles he tried at the end of his career. Laurent Cantets Entre Les Murs (The Class) is a French film about a tough inner-city school. Maybe its too tough to count as inspirational, although its seriousness is inspiring in a way  as is the final, enigmatically moving shot of the empty classroom. And a mention should go to Goodbye, Mr Chips, the 1939 version, with Robert Donat as the much-loved public schoolmaster who teaches generations of boys right in the decades leading up to the first world war; despite his own poignantly short and childless marriage, he thinks of all these boys as his children. Goodbye, Mr Chips is an example of how the inspirational movie is a cousin to the weepie. Its a Wonderful Life deserves a kind of peripheral inclusion here, for being where inspirational triangulates with the weepie and the Christmas film. Part of the agenda of the sentimental Christmas movie is to inspire characters and audience to lead better lives. That is very much the point of Frank Capras celebrated work, in which George Bailey is shown a vision (not dissimilar to those vouchsafed to Scrooge) of what his hometown would have been like if he had not sacrificed his own ambitions to help the community. Just as inspirational  and brilliant  is Harold Ramiss Groundhog Day. Bill Murrays misanthropic weatherman is trapped in a repeating day, made to go through it again and again, and inspect his own life in all the detail he had arrogantly ignored, with an infinite amount of time to acquaint himself with every square millimetre of the hokey small town he had presumed to despise. He becomes a better person, but the films own comic miracle is that it doesnt labour this point, despite Murrays hilariously laborious ordeal, or even make it explicit. And I think that is inspirational. But for me, the one genre I find really and truly inspirational  without having to claim it as a guilty pleasure  is any film about people forming bands at school. Movies such as John Carneys Sing Street and Lukas Moodysons We Are the Best! are genuinely inspirational because they are about self-betterment and self-fulfilment, in their way, but no one is telling the pupil musicians they have to do it to get good grades or be a more responsible person. In fact, the grownup world is usually frowning at the whole idea of being in something as disreputable as a pop group. So there is something entrepreneurial, creative and rebellious about it. Under this heading, I would also include Good Vibrations, an excellent film about Terri Hooley, the record shop owner who nurtured Belfasts punk scene and brought the Undertones to the world. Isolating a moment of inspiration in a film is an interesting challenge. Alexander Paynes About Schmidt is a relentlessly dark film on the painful theme of family dysfunction. Jack Nicholsons performance is dyspeptic and despairing: his face (like Paul Giamattis in Sideways or Bruce Derns in Nebraska) is on the point of becoming an immobile mask of disappointment or despair. Yet every time I see him burst into tears at his letter from the little African boy, I find the moment euphoric  and, yes, sort of inspirational. There is something irresistible in the possibility of Schmidts redemption, even in its broad implausibility. So maybe About Schmidt is my favourite motivational film.

Arsenal go back up to third, a point above Spurs and Manchester City, after a win that was totally routine, save for Olivier Girouds spectacular opening goal, which was anything but. Its the only thing well remember from this game in a years time, and a moment of individual brilliance that may take the next 12 months to top. Thanks for joining me; our match report will follow shortly. Cheerio! 92 mins: Palaces hardy away following cheer as their team string a few passes together  but theyre soon on the back foot, Snchez skipping into the area and teeing up Oxlade-Chamberlain, in acres of space. Hennessey gets down well to parry his low shot, and keep it at 2-0. 91 mins: Three added minutes. 90 mins: His cross-shot is flicked over the bar by Tomkins. From the corner, its worked back to Xhaka, whose shot is closed down. 89 mins: Ramsey is tripped by Tomkins, picking up a yellow card and conceding a free kick. Xhaka will swing this one in from wide on the right... 87 mins: Ramsey gets involved, picking up Oxlade-Chamberlains pass, carving out a yard of space and smashing a shot just wide of Hennesseys near post. 85 mins: A textbook New Years Day scoreline in the National League, where its finished Forest Green 5-5 Torquay. 83 mins: Zaha slips between Monreal and Coquelin, forcing the former to take one for the team with a cynical clip to his heels. He is booked, but Mutchs free-kick drifts out of play. 81 mins: Ward and Kelly have been put through their paces at full-back today. Oxlade-Chamberlain is the latest to put the hurt on Ward, zipping past him down the right and firing a low cross thats cleared away. 80 mins: This match is meandering towards a conclusion, with two of Palaces first-choice attacking threats off the pitch. So, why not watch this instead: 78 mins: Snchez cuts inside and crosses towards Giroud, who doesnt make contact but distracts Hennessey, who has to make an awkward one-handed save to keep it from drifting into the far corner. 76 mins: Change for Palace, with Benteke replaced by Campbell. The scoreline suggests he should be staying on, his performance less so  but perhaps, with Swansea visiting Selhurst Park on Tuesday, he and Townsend are being rested. 75 mins: Snchez takes it, but fires his free-kick into the wall. One final change for Arsenal, with goalscorer Iwobi replaced by Oxlade-Chamberlain. 74 mins: Arsenal have changed shape slightly, with Ramsey and Coquelin beefing up central midfield, leaving Iwobi and Snchez to support Giroud. Bellern is brought down 25 yards out, just right of goal. Xhaka and Snchez are over the free kick... 71 mins: Two Arsenal changes, as Elneny and Lucas head off, replaced by Ramsey and Coquelin. One for Palace, with Townsend replaced by Lee Chung-yong. 70 mins: Zaha doesnt track Bellern back downfield, and the Arsenal mans cut-back is hacked away. Xhaka then tries to test Hennessey from a long, long way out, but his shot is deflected behind. 69 mins: Zaha does get the better of Bellern down the left this time, and his low cross is smartly cleared away by Xhaka, whos been quietly impressive again today. 67 mins: Bellern, described by Gary Neville as a good full-back and not a great defender in quick succession, makes a smart interception to strip the ball from Zaha. He combines with the useful Lucas down the right, but his cross in the direction of Giroud is claimed by Hennessey. 65 mins: Townsend and Zaha are finding, to their amazement, that when they venture into the Arsenal half, theyre getting some joy. Townsend leads a counter attack that ends with a slightly wild Zaha effort, but theyre making in-roads. An attacking change here, as Cabaye is replaced by Jordon Mutch. Big Sam should wear one of those helmet hats with cup holders and straws so he can sip on some lager as he watches his new team says JR in Illinois. And when Zaha leaves for a month he might want to replace the lager with gin. Or paint thinner. 63 mins: Townsend sends another deep cross in which catches Cech off guard, forcing the keeper to tip it behind. 62 mins: Arsenal try to shake off their traditional post-goal slump, Snchez again front-and-centre, but the move peters out. 60 mins: From the corner, Kelly miskicks as the ball bobbles into his path, before Townsend stings Cechs palms again from the left of the area. If only the visitors had started the second half like this... 59 mins: Palace win a corner, and Benteke forces Cech into an awkward save with a bullet header. The ball is cleared as far as Cabaye, whose long-distance effort has Cech back-pedalling to turn the ball wide! That could go down as a Joel Ward own goal, the Palace full-back attempting to clear, but heading the ball in off his own bar. That rather sums up Palaces day. Snchez has had Palace dancing to his tune all game long, and he sends several defenders the wrong way with a reverse pass to Monreal, whose cross is cleared by Dann, high into the air. It lands in the six-yard box, and Iwobi heads over Hennessey and into the roof of the net, despite the efforts of two Palace players on the line. Palace cant keep Arsenal out any longer, Alex Iwobi with an agreeably scrappy goal, in contrast to the opener. 53 mins: Up! Up! Up! shouts Allardyce, looking ever more like an irate binman on the touchline. Palace dont listen, and Snchez drifts inside and picks out Lucas Prez, whose cross wafts out of play. 50 mins: The pattern from the first half has returned, with Arsenal stringing silky passes around in front of a packed Palace defence. Snchez pulls off a flamboyant stepover in space, but drills his pass to Lucas straight at a defender. 49 mins: Moments later, a scramble sees Iwobis shot blocked before Snchez lashes at goal. It could have gone anywhere, but smashes off the fortunate, or unfortunate, Scott Dann and out to safety. 48 mins: Arsenal try to make Palace pay, Snchez drilling a pass to Lucas, who steers it across goal, with nobody there. 46 mins: Palaces best chance by a mile, as Townsend cuts back onto his left foot, and hangs a cross up towards Benteke. He has the jump on Bellern, but doesnt get a clean header, the ball squirting past the far post! Were back under way. Bellern immediately bursts down the right, but his low cross is cleared away. The internet is currently ablaze with scorpion kicks and flicks from the archive. Thanks to Mister Justin for this one: Arsne seems complacently to have disposed of his generals hat, with scenes of comic bedragglement in front of goal to follow says Charles Antaki. Hopefully its hanging up somewhere handy for the second half. A first half memorable only for an extraordinary Olivier Giroud goal. If Palace want this game to be remembered for anything else, theyll need to get their act together. Back soon. 45 mins: Another defensive masterclass from Palace, Kelly toe-poking a harmless Bellern cross back into danger, allowing Snchez a free hit from close to the penalty spot. Hennessey saves, and Palace are let off the hook. 43 mins: Palace have begun to inch upfield, but Arsenal exploit the gaps, the ball worked to Snchez, whose shot from 20 yards has power, but flies into Hennesseys arms. Therell be one minute of added time. 41 mins: Zaha finally gets some forward momentum, jinking away from Giroud and drawing a foul. Another long ball, another meek effort by Benteke to reel it in, and it bounces through to Cech. 38 mins: Shades of a training exercise, with Arsenals wide players trying to find inventive ways of infiltrating a crowded penalty area. Snchez races to the byline, then back, and hits an angled cross over everybodys heads. 36 mins: Iwobi tries to lift the ball towards Giroud, who has drifted offside. Arsenals intensity dropping again, as half-time approaches. 34 mins: Elneny has all the time in the world to slot a pass to Lucas Prez, whose cushioned pass finds Snchez on the corner of the penalty area. His shot swerves wide of the far post, the entire move happening without a Palace player getting within three yards of an opponent. 32 mins: Townsend and Kelly are getting in each others way trying to deal with Snchez, whose looping cross finds Monreal, a fraction offside. This has been an entirely enjoyable first half hour for Arsenal. 30 mins: Elneny threads a pass over Crystal Palaces ten-man defence, but Bellern is unable to keep his cross in play. 28 mins: Palace enjoy a spell of possession in the Arsenal half, and Townsend looks to find Zaha with a deep cross. Its overhit, and by some distance. 26 mins: Iwobi dances in the penalty area, then lays the ball back to Elneny, steaming forward from midfield, who slaps an ambitious 30-yarder a long way wide. Arsenal may be trying to score a better goal than Girouds, and thats to be applauded. Heres Will W with a lesser-spotted scorpion kick  second in the clip, and the first one isnt bad either: 24 mins: Arsenal have slowed the pace down, stroking it around before a Palace break is ended by the half-hearted Benteke drifting offside. 22 mins: Ill be honest, Im still thinking about the goal. 20 mins: Townsend almost gives us something else to savour, trying to prevent a corner and almost handing the ball to Monreal five yards out. Hennessey scrambles to spare his team-mates blushes. Scorpion kicks, theyre like buses. You wait years for one, etc and so on. I particularly enjoyed the lusty ooooh from the crowd when it was replayed on the Emirates big screen. Palace tried to break upfield, and were immediately caught short at the back, the ball worked swiftly to Snchez on the left. His cross was high and behind Giroud, lurking 12 yards out, but the striker executed a sublime scorpion kick, sending the ball in off the bar with his left heel! Henrikh Mkhitaryan, eat your heart out. Olivier Giroud may have just scored the goal of the season! 15 mins: Iwobi tests Hennessey from 12 yards out, but the keeper gathers his slippery low shot at the second time of asking. 13 mins: Arsenal continue their efforts to unpick the Palace defence, but Snchezs return ball to the lively Lucas Prez is overhit, and Palace have a chance to relieve the pressure. 11 mins: Arsenal have hit their straps early on, and Lucas combines artfully with Elneny, and then Bellern, lofting a pass towards the full-back thats cleared away. It comes straight back, and Snchez lets rip from 25 yards out, his shot pinging a foot wide of Hennesseys far post. On managers hats, Justin Kavanagh says Im seeing Arsne in a Napoleons hat, with hand hidden in his big long puffy coat, with Big Sam dressed as the Duke of Wellington in the other coachs area. Allardyce, disappointingly, has a regulation beanie on. 8 mins: Townsend steps on Monreals ankle chasing a 50-50 ball, and is lucky to escape further action from birthday boy Andre Marriner. 6 mins: How are Arsenal not ahead here? Xhaka, pulling the strings behind that creative trio, slots an identical low pass, this time to Monreal on the left. He cuts back to Giroud, unmarked at the near post  but he doesnt make contact, and his weird flailing puts off Lucas, stationed on the other side of goal! 5 mins: Lucas, Iwobi and Snchez are swirling behind Giroud, causing Palace all sorts of problems. Iwobi tries a diagonal daisy-cutter to Bellern, but its just about cut out. 4 mins: Theres a muted atmosphere in the early stages, which means we can hear Keith Millen bellowing at Wilfried Zaha to track back. Lucas, who was excellent against Basel in the Champions League from the right, almost latches on to a through-ball, but Hennessey is out smartly to clear. At last the answer to Arsnes worries about his players faffing about before scoring says Charles Antaki. Procure one of those superb generals hats and all will be resolved. Im surprised Antonio Conte doesnt wear one already. 2 min: Iwobi toe-pokes a pass through to Snchez, who barrels in from the left but gets crowded out. Corner, which Xhaka swings just out of reach of Koscielny. Palace not exactly well-drilled at the back early on. Were off... The players are out at a drizzly, dark Emirates Stadium. Predictions? Im going to stick my neck out, and say Arsenal will shade possession, and win by one late goal. In meaningless milestone news, this is the 200th Premier League game played here: The quality of football in this clip escalates dramatically: The aforementioned warm-up proved too much for Ezekiel Fryers, who picked up an injury and is replaced on the bench by academy graduate Michael Phillips. Palaces squad is stretched thin; Sam Allardyce confirms that James Tomkins has been rushed back with a lack of defensive options. Arsne Wenger says hes been forced to rotate, with a trip to Bournemouth coming up on Tuesday. Half an hour to go; the players are out warming up in assorted beanies, leggings and snoods. Would you like to see a picture of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain feeding a baby tiger? Of course you would. Result! It finished Watford 1-4 Tottenham at Vicarage Road. Rob Smyth watched it unfold: Spurs climb above Arsenal in the table, for now. A surprise win for Palace would leave the Gunners stuck in fifth, and the bottom three a little isolated. If youve no idea what the table looks like, after the relentless flurry of festive football (theres more games tomorrow, you know), its here. Some enjoyable pre-match reading from David Hytner, on Arsne Wengers long history with Sam Allardyce: No Mesut zil for Arsenal today  hes unwell, so the grapevine tells me  so Lucas Prez gets his first Premier League start since the opening day. Nacho Monreal replaces Kieran Gibbs at left-back, and Mohamed Elneny is in for Francis Coquelin, whos on the bench. Allardyce makes just one change, with James Tomkins back in central defence in place of Damien Delaney, who is on the naughty step after picking up a fifth booking against Watford. Arsenal: Cech; Bellern, Gabriel, Koscielny, Monreal; Elneny, Xhaka; Lucas Prez, Iwobi, Snchez; Giroud. Subs: Ospina, Ramsey, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Mustafi, Reine-Adlade, Coquelin, Maitland-Niles. Crystal Palace: Hennessey; Ward, Dann, Tomkins, Kelly; Flamini, Puncheon, Cabaye; Townsend, Zaha, C Benteke. Subs: Speroni, Campbell, Lee, Fryers, Mutch, Sako, Husin. Referee: Andre Marriner Happy new year! 366 days ago, Arsenal began 2016 top of the league, with Crystal Palace in fifth, four points off the top four. Things were looking up, but right on cue, the wheels came off. Arsenal finished 10 points behind Leicester, whose march to the title would have stung both these sides, for different reasons. There were small victories  member St. Totteringhams Day? Member Pards dancing?  but while Arsenal sputtered and stalled, Palace put the whole thing in reverse, and six (SIX) league wins in the whole year meant Pards danced no more. Hes replaced by Sam Allardyce, another for whom 2016 was, to put it mildly, a bit of a mixed bag. Big Sam used to enjoy these tussles with Arsne Wenger, but hasnt won a league game against Arsenal since his Blackburn days. Its been an even longer wait for Palace  Whigfield was No1 the last time they took three points home from North London  Highbury to be precise, back in 1994. For both managers, both teams, and the rest of us, bleary and remorseful, today is the perfect time to start again. Kick-off is at 4pm GMT; teams to follow.','sport'),(56,'The New Years Eve attack on an Istanbul nightclub concluded a dreadful year for Turkey, during which the country was shaken by a failed military coup, a policy setback in neighbouring Syria and a string of terrorist atrocities. No group has yet claimed responsibility for Saturday nights attack, but suspicion will fall on Islamic State. The group repeatedly struck at Turkish cities in 2016 in retaliation for Ankaras support for international efforts to suppress its activities in Syria and Iraq. Given recent history, an extremist Kurdish nationalist group known as the Freedom Falcons, or TAK, could also be in the frame for the attack. It claimed responsibility for bomb explosions outside a football stadium in Istanbul that killed 45 people in December, and a car bomb attack in Adana the previous month. The TAK, a breakaway faction of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers party (PKK), says it is responding to a harsh crackdown by the army and police in Kurdish areas of south-eastern Turkey. The crackdown, which displaced thousands of civilians, followed the collapse in 2015 of a ceasefire between the PKK and the government of Recep Tayyip Erdoan, Turkeys president. In all there were several dozen serious terrorist attacks in Turkey in 2016, often targeting the police and army but just as often hitting civilians. Government officials have also pointed the finger of blame for some attacks at Syrian Kurds. They claim the Syrian Kurd Peoples Protection Units (YPG) are allied to the PKK and share its aims of carving out autonomous Kurdish areas in Syria and Turkey. Turkeys military intervention in northern Syria by ground and air in 2016 inflamed the situation. It was ostensibly designed to assist the fight against Isis. But Erdoans main purpose in ordering the only direct Syrian intervention by any Nato member country was to contain the YPGs territorial advances and prevent any linkup with the autonomous Kurdish areas of northern Iraq. This effort is still under way. The YPG were specifically excluded from the Syria ceasefire jointly brokered by Turkey, Russia and Iran last week. But it remains unclear whether Erdoans effort will be successful. What is clear is that Erdoans manoeuvrings have brought Turkey into conflict with its long-time ally the US, which does not not share Ankaras view of the YPG as terrorists but sees them as useful anti-Assad fighters. US material and weapons support for the YPG provoked Turkish protests. Erdoans intervention has also brought strains with Iran, Turkeys historical rival dating back to the time of the Ottoman and Persian empires. Although both governments oppose Kurdish minority aspirations, Sunni Muslim Turkey resents Shia Irans increasing influence in Iraq and Syria and in other areas it views as within its traditional spheres of influence. Viewed overall, Erdoans Syrian policy flopped badly in 2016. In the light of the Russian and Iranian-led battlefield successes, notably the fall of Aleppo, Erdoan was forced to freeze his key demand that Assad step down. And having burned his bridges with Washington, he has also been obliged to throw his weight behind Moscows peacemaking efforts. But the assassination of Russias ambassador to Turkey in Ankara last month by a man shouting Remember Aleppo underlined how fragile the bilateral relationship  in tatters a year ago after a Russian warplane was shot down  remains. Domestically, an attempted army coup last summer almost succeeded in toppling Erdoan. The wave of repression that followed including the jailing of thousands of alleged supporters of the exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen and a ruthless crackdown on the judiciary, academia and the media. Erdoan has accused the HDP, the leading pro-Kurdish party, of supporting the PKK, and several of its leaders were detained. At the same time, he continued to push through constitutional changes designed to give him quasi-autocratic presidential executive powers. Meanwhile, attempts by Turkish officials to implicate the Obama administration in the coup attempt, because of its refusal to extradite Gulen, further strained ties with Washington. Erdoan fell out simultaneously with the EU over sharp European criticism of post-coup human rights abuses. As the new year begins, Erdoan appears set on strengthening his grip on power, by both democratic and undemocratic means, and pursuing his onslaught against the Kurds inside Turkey and in Syria. In a statement issued after Saturday nights attack, he vowed to fight to the end against terrorists whose aim he said was to create chaos and destabilise the country. But Turks heard tough-sounding language of that kind from Erdoan on too many similar occasions in 2016. More and more people may conclude that it is the presidents failed, divisive policies that must change if the carnage is to end.','business'),(57,'Claudio Ranieri will want to see Leicester City capitalise on their solid win over West Ham.

The industry has come under the spotlight amid concern about its commitment to curbing problem gambling and fears about the influence that daytime TV adverts have on children. The increased scrutiny culminated in a government review of betting firms social responsibility, including controversial fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs), often dubbed the crack cocaine of gambling for their addictive nature. The parliamentary register of members interests, which details the value of gifts and donations received by politicians, reveals that major bookmakers and horse racing firms quadrupled their efforts to entertain MPs ahead of the review. Politicians enjoyed the largesse of the gambling world on 33 separate occasions last year, accepting tickets worth thousands of pounds to racing and football events.They accepted nearly 20,000 of hospitality, including tickets to Ascot, the Derby and the Grand National. The two biggest beneficiaries were Conservative MPs Laurence Robertson, and Philip Davies, who was referred to the MPs ethics watchdog in 2013 over his links to the gambling industry. Davies accepted 4,720 of hospitality from the gambling industry in 2016, while Robertson enjoyed entertainment worth 5,166. On their basic salary of 74,962, it would take an MP nearly a month to earn enough to pay for 5,166 of hospitality out of their own pocket. Other notable recipients include former SNP leader Alec Salmond  who was given a badge worth up to 1,000 by the Racecourse Association permitting entry to certain racecourses  and secretary of state for international development Priti Patel. She was given two Grand National tickets worth 2,000 by Jockey Club Racecourses. The amount spent on MPs  during a year in which the threat of increased regulation has loomed large  was a major increase on 2015, when gambling and racing firms hosted MPs just nine times, to a total value of less than 5,000. A spokesman for the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, which campaigns for FOBT maximum stakes to be reduced from 100 to 2, said: Those MPs who accept the bookies free entertainment must surely realise what this is really about and why all of a sudden they are splashing the cash on them. They are trying to garner what support they can for their 100-a-spin machines and stave off what looks like an impending clampdown by the government. Our campaign looks forward to finding out where the 33 MPs who have accepted hospitality stand on the issue of the bookies addictive machines. Last month Carolyn Harris, Labour MP for Swansea East, called for the maximum stake on FOBTs to be reduced in her capacity as chair of the all-party parliamentary group on FOBTs. She said: Interestingly Ive never been offered any hospitality, not that I would expect to be. There is no suggestion that any of the named MPs have been unduly influenced in their decision making by gifts received. The UKs booming gambling sector also continued to ramp up its spending on TV adverts. Excluding lotteries, gambling firms had spent 94.4m on TV adverts by the end of October, according to data analysis firm Nielsen, putting them on course to beat the118.8m spent in 2015. Including lotteries and spending in the print media and billboards, betting firms had spent 211m by October, with figures for the full year not due to be released until February. The amount of gambling advertising on TV has triggered concerns among politicians and campaigners about the potential impact on children of daytime adverts for gambling, which are permitted alongside sporting events. The gambling industry also ramped up its lobbying efforts with the Back Your Local Bookie campaign, launched by the Association of British Bookmakers (ABB). The ABB tweeted about the campaign in mid-October, which coincided with the Department of Culture, Media and Sport launching its call for evidence on gaming machines and social responsibility. The campaign website includes an automated form that allows people to put their name to a letter to their local MP, worded by the ABB. It reads: Im tired of how bookmakers are constantly misrepresented, and Im concerned about the impact of any further regulation on bookies. Betting shops are closing at a rate of over 100 per year and with that local authorities are losing yet another business rate paying retailer from their high streets. And without bookies, our high streets will continue to suffer a decline in footfall. The potential for further regulation will only hasten these closures. My local bookie is a sociable, fun meeting place, with great staff, and I want it to stay that way.','politics'),(59,'Lily danced in the leaves while I spoke to a hippy from Turkey. He spoke of peace because hed seen war. He talked about love because he knew hate; hate&nbsp;for those above him, hate for those he had served with, hate for enemies not born his but who became so, and lastly, hate for himself because of how his mind had been controlled. He talked about life and living because he had seen death, and been the cause of it. He had long hair because the army had forced him to shave his head. Now he had a beard. I liked my new bearded friend; his life until then had not been of his own making, but he was taking it back. I felt fuzzy and wonderful as the grey, abrasive side of life wobbled away to rainbow jelly as the acid kicked in. And then Lily was standing in front of me. The look on her face was out of the ordinary and I knew instinctively that something serious had happened. Lily looked vulnerable. I had never seen her look vulnerable. A man on the dancefloor grabbed me. Ive been sexually assaulted. It was raining on her face but the sky was dry. Do something! My mind raced through a hundred thoughts in half a second. What are you going to do? You cant fight. What if he knows any kind of fighting? You have to do something or your girlfriend is going to think you less of a man, but you also dont want to get killed. You are on acid, you idiot. What are you going to do? Hug this guy to death? Talk philosophical nonsense about the nature of violence? I took Lilys hand and we walked to the dancefloor and then up to the bar in search of the guy. I had no idea what I was going to do. This was my John Wayne moment, only I wasnt a cowboy, a fighter or anything like John Wayne. I&nbsp;felt better by assuring myself that I had been beaten up before, and from what I&nbsp;remembered, it wasnt that bad. The bar was busy with chatter, but there was a clear and unobstructed view&nbsp;from where Lily and I stood all the&nbsp;way to the bench where she pointed out the man in question, who sat laughing with four friends. Five thugs in&nbsp;total. Splendid. These guys were not dressed for a New Years Eve travellers rave in a jungle. They leered across the bar throwing judgmental daggers at the laughter and sparkles. They were trying&nbsp;to act like they needed to be perceived, so they stood out in a jungle full of hippies whose basic philosophy is&nbsp;to be yourself. The guy who grabbed Lily was bald, and violent around the eyes. He&nbsp;was thick with muscle, and so were his&nbsp;friends. I walked toward the men. They stared back. The man who had touched Lily pointed at me and laughed. He beckoned me to keep walking. He was enjoying the moment. I stopped. They stood. We waited. This was now a&nbsp;scene like in some action film, without the guns or hero. I needed&nbsp;to think of something fast, or I was walking towards a beating. I lifted my hand above my head, and shouted at the top of my voice: I have something I need to say to everyone here and its very&nbsp;important! A crowd of over 300 people at various states of enlightenment stopped what they were doing and looked at me. I walked up to the man sitting with his group of friends and pointed at him and said: This man does not belong here. He is not part of the party. This man has just sexually assaulted my girlfriend on the dancefloor. He is not one of us. He is negative energy. If you see him, be on guard! The guys stopped laughing and looked to the floor. They hid their faces. They stormed toward me. I was going to get hit in the face. The crowd, remarkably, jeered. The men stopped, now surrounded by many, unsure what to do. The fight was no longer five on one: this was five against hundreds. The few party people who hadnt noticed the commotion now watched. A girl moved forward and yelled at the men to go. Another stepped forward and booed. Then everyone booed. The men stared at the crowd, then back at me with wild eyes. An angry mob had developed, of hippies yielding glow sticks. The circle parted, the men ran out of the circle, down the path, away from the bar and into the jungle. The man who had touched Lily stumbled as he ran, and as&nbsp;he hit the floor the crowd cheered. I had used peace to beat the thugs around the head. This New Years Eve taught me that if we just gather the strength to ask for help, the good are powerful, and fear does not have to be faced alone.

Richard Angell, of the centrist Progress group closely associated with the New Labour years, said it was his new years resolution to stop an amendment supported by the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, which would lower the number of supportive MPs needed to qualify as a leadership candidate. Currently, would-be candidates need the support of 15% of their parliamentary colleagues for their name to be added to the ballot. However, the Labour conference this year will vote on whether to lower the threshold to 5% of MPs. The move is favoured by supporters of Jeremy Corbyn because it is viewed as an avenue to allow a continuity leftwing candidate to succeed him whenever he chooses to resign. The amendment was put forward by a local constituency group and does not need the formal backing of Labours national executive committee to be put to conference. An NEC source said they thought Labour delegates in their current political makeup would be unlikely to back such a controversial amendment at Labours next conference. Angell wrote in a blog for the Progress website: This pitiful threshold not only belittles the idea of leadership, it is an anathema to Labours commitment to parliamentary socialism and to Britains parliamentary democracy. Our system require the candidate to be prime minister to command overwhelming support on the treasury benches. The hard lefts amendment acknowledges that their candidate for leader will never command that kind of support. Angell suggested McDonnell was keen to lower the threshold for nomination because he was eager for the chance to run for the leadership himself, though McDonnell has publicly denied this and said he will never stand for the leadership of the Labour party. The shadow chancellor recently tipped other members of the shadow cabinet to eventually succeed Corbyn, including the shadow business secretary, Clive Lewis, and the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner. A Labour source said it was clear both sides of the party would be mobilising long before conference. Either way, its not a McDonnell amendment  thats Progress trying to fire up their base, the source said. The move to lower the threshold is backed by Momentum, the grassroots movement set up after the election of Corbyn, and the leftwing Campaign for Labour party Democracy group, of which Corbyn was formerly a member. Alice Perry, a member of Labours NEC, said party members focus should instead focus on getting ready to fight any snap general election. The next Labour party conference is nine months away. A lot can happen in that time, including a possible general election, she said. We saw the political landscape shift dramatically in 2016, Labours priority has to be to respond to the new challenges we face, articulate our own compelling, positive vision for the UKs future and fight every election 2017 has in store, including some very important local elections. Meanwhile, Labours Brexit spokesman, Keir Starmer, has told the Sunday Times that he backs a fundamental rethink of free movement rules after the UK exits the EU  far stronger language than used by the party leader. The rules on free movement have got to be changed or the way the rules operate has got to change, he said. People, when you talk to them about immigration, have a strong distinction in their mind between people who are coming here to work and contribute and those who are coming here to look for work, and I think that distinction is well worth exploring. Corbyn has previously said he believes the pitfalls of free movement have been exaggerated, and expressed doubts that a work permit system could be fairly applied. Meanwhile the man vying to take over the countrys biggest trade union is expected to warn that workers will feel betrayed if Britain does not take control of its borders after it quits the European Union. Gerard Coyne, who hopes to oust Len McCluskey as general secretary of the Unite union will say the government should not even begin to negotiate over immigration as it attempts to thrash out a Brexit settlement. Coyne, Unites West Midlands regional secretary, will use a speech in Birmingham on Monday to say migration within the EU has benefited those who are better off by allowing them to hire low cost cleaners and nannies, but has put pressure on services and housing for many others.','politics'),(63,'The director Philip Saville, who has died aged 86, was an important figure in British television drama  an innovative practitioner who brought Alan Bleasdales 1982 drama Boys from the Blackstuff to the screen. The series, which concerned the harrowing effects of unemployment on five Liverpudlian men, had a difficult gestation  the BBC was not easily persuaded to allow a supposedly arty director to convey the reality of the disenfranchised working classes. While he greatly admired Bleasdales scripts, Saville suggested rewrites, notably expanding the role of Angie, the wife of one of the men, Chrissie (Michael Angelis). This added a strong female element to an otherwise male-dominated piece and provided Julie Walters with a breakthrough role. One episode, Yossers Story, featured the broken Yosser Hughes (Bernard Hill) desperately asking gissa job as his sanity was eroded along with his self-respect. By shooting Yossers Story on film, Saville gave it a haunting grandeur (the other episodes benefited from the immediacy of being made entirely on videotape, unusual for the time). The series won the Bafta award for best drama serial. Saville was born in east London. His father, Louis  whose own father, Joseph Saffer, had anglicised the family name, appropriately adopting one related to his trade as a master tailor  was a travelling salesman for a clothing company. Philips mother, Sadie (nee Tanenberg, and known as Kay), was the supervisor of the womens fashion department at Fortnum &amp; Mason in Piccadilly. During the second world war he attended several different schools, then began a science-based course at the University of London, and enrolled at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (Rada). He was called up for national service and posted to the Royal Corps of Signals in Catterick, but was discharged following an accident with an armoured vehicle that badly damaged his knee. He spent some time in the US  studying Shakespeare, acting and directing  and then back in the UK in the late 1950s appeared in low-budget quickie films. Adept at electronics  he enjoyed fixing radios  he was then drawn to the new medium of television. Having directed the TV movie Curtains for Harry (1955), co-written by his wife Jane Arden (whom he had married in 1947) and Richard Lester, he joined ABC Television, for whom he would direct more than 40 episodes of Armchair Theatre (from 1956). Great technical skill was required to realise his ambitious visuals  the framing and camera angles  as many of these productions were live. His trademark was inventive use of the camera, and he sometimes used mirrors to create offbeat, beguiling imagery or otherwise unachievable shots. His intense 1960 production of Harold Pinters A Night Out was a breakthrough success for both writer and director, topping the weeks ratings. He also directed Pinter (and Arden) in Sartres In Camera (for the BBCs Wednesday Play, 1964) and returned to its subject of existential angst in The Logic Game (1965). He could be a hard taskmaster, but won the respect of his crews because he always had the best interests of the production at heart and the results were of the highest quality. His visual experimentation worked in harmony with a keen intellectualism, and he pushed the envelope both technically and in terms of subject matter. Indeed Three on a Gas Ring (1959), about a unrepentant single mother who elects to bring her illegitimate child up on a houseboat with two other women, was never broadcast. The Independent Television Authority watchdog felt it might encourage immorality and destabilise family values. For The Madhouse on Castle Street (BBC Sunday Night Play, 1963), he flew in Bob Dylan, whom he had seen performing in New York City, to play the lead part. It soon became apparent that this would not work, so Saville split the role in two, hiring David Warner to do the acting while Dylan did the singing. In 1964, with Hamlet at Elsinore he broke new ground by recording the play entirely on location (with a Danish crew) at Kronborg Castle. Christopher Plummer was Hamlet, Robert Shaw Claudius and Michael Caine Horatio. Savilles technically sophisticated BBC production of EM Forsters The Machine Stops (1966) won the top prize at the 1967 Trieste international science fiction film festival. The Play for Today Gangsters (1975, by Philip Martin) mixed gritty urban realism with offbeat storytelling and spawned a successful spin-off series. Tall, handsome and urbane, Saville had a personal life that was as rich and vivid as his work. He and Arden separated in the mid-60s, but did not divorce. Savilles affair with the pop artist Pauline Boty was said to have inspired the film Darling (1965). He and Diana Rigg lived together for some years from the mid-1960s. When preparing Count Dracula (1977, still regarded as one of the most faithful adaptations of Bram Stokers novel), he auditioned the actor Nina Francis. He did not cast her but eventually, in 1987, they married. After Boys from the Blackstuff, he won another Bafta (beating Dennis Potters The Singing Detective) for The Life and Loves of a She-Devil (1986). It was an effective retelling of Fay Weldons novel, as was The Cloning of Joanna May (1992). Later work included The Buccaneers (1995, a controversial adaptation of Edith Whartons unfinished novel), My Uncle Silas (two series, 2001 and 2003, with Albert Finney playing HE Batess character) and The Gospel of John (for the Canadian Visual Bible project, 2003). In 2009, his documentary Pinters Progress shed a personal light on the playwright, and latterly he taught aspiring actors at Rada. His feature film work included Stop the World I Want to Get Off (1966), Oedipus the King (1967), The Best House in London (1969), The Fruit Machine (1988) and Metroland (1997), with Christian Bale and Emily Watson . At the time of his death he was putting the finishing touches to an autobiography, provisionally titled They Shoot Directors, Dont They? He is survived by Nina and their son, Waldo; by two sons, Sebastian and Dominic, from his marriage to Arden (who died in 1982); and by a daughter, Elizabeth, from another relationship.

The BBC programme concluded in December and drew audiences of more than 12 million viewers but presents an escapist wildlife fantasy that ignores the damage humans are doing to species everywhere, according to Martin Hughes-Games, a presenter of the BBCs Springwatch. In a direct attack on Attenboroughs flagship series, which features a soundtrack by the Hollywood composer Hans Zimmer and became the most-watched nature programme in 15 years when it was broadcast last month, Hughes-Games said the makers had ignored evidence of mass extinction, most recently from the World Wide Fund for Nature and the Zoological Society of London, which reported last year that between 1970 and 2012 there had been a 58% decline in the abundance of vertebrates worldwide. These programmes are still made as if this worldwide mass extinction is simply not happening, he said. The producers continue to go to the rapidly shrinking parks and reserves to make their films  creating a beautiful, beguiling, fantasy world, a utopia where tigers still roam free and untroubled, where the natural world exists as if man had never been. The result is that Attenborough and others are lulling the huge worldwide audience into a false sense of security, he said. No hint of the continuing disaster is allowed to shatter the illusion. Attenborough, however, did use the series to make an impassioned plea for greater conservation. At the end of the final episode he spoke of our responsibility to do everything within our power to create a planet that provides a home not just for us, but for all life on Earth. He has also insisted that his programmes enable an increasingly urbanised global population to remain in touch with nature. More people are out of touch with the natural world than have ever been, Attenborough said at a press conference to launch the series in October. But since we depend on the natural world, understanding it is absolutely paramount. Television can provide that link better than ever before, in some ways. Fifty years ago, there was hardly a species on [Planet Earth II] that anyone would have seen. Now everybody has. Its remarkable, and its valuable. The BBC declined to comment on Hughes-Gamess criticism that the impression of pristine wildlife Attenboroughs shows create was misleading. Even as Planet Earth II was being broadcast, it was reported that elephant and lion numbers were tumbling, and last month it became clear that the giraffe could be heading towards extinction, with numbers plummeting by 40% in the past 15 years, Hughes-Games said. There is, however, also evidence of improving fortunes for some species. Tiger numbers are thought to be increasing and the giant panda has recently been removed from the list of endangered species. Hughes-Games said he was not arguing that programmes such as Planet Earth II should not be made. He said fantasy should be balanced by reality and urged the BBC to commit to making more wildlife programmes that overtly address conservation. Hughes-Games proposed injecting conservation themes into TV dramas and childrens programming. He said: As a matter of urgency, a development team should be set up to think how the reality of whats happening to wildlife worldwide can be portrayed in innovative ways, integrated in dramas, in childrens shows  in collaborations with producers like Aardman Animations, perhaps, or video diaries of inspirational people working with animals.','entertainment'),(65,'It has been wonderful watching Planet Earth II. What a glorious, spectacular and fascinating series. Hats off to the production team, the camera crews, the film editors and the splendid music  and to David Attenborough himself for the marvellous commentary and script. We have surely never been so close to the action and never have the pictures looked so luxurious. I have the greatest admiration for the teams who made Planet Earth II  whose final episode was broadcast last night on the BBC  but I fear this series, and others like it, have become a disaster for the worlds wildlife. These programmes are pure entertainment, brilliantly executed but ultimately a significant contributor to the planet-wide extinction of wildlife were presiding over. The justification, say the programme makers, is that if people (the audience) become interested in the natural world they will start to care about the natural world, and will be more likely to want to get involved in trying to conserve it. Unfortunately the scientific evidence shows this is nonsense. For instance, the World Wide Fund for Nature and Zoological Society of Londons authoritative 2016 Living Planet Report has concluded that between 1970 and 2012 there was a 58% decline of vertebrate population abundance worldwide. This encompasses the period in which Attenboroughs outstanding natural history series have been broadcast (starting with Life on Earth in 1979). The prime factor in this destruction is humankinds insatiable need for space  destroying and degrading habitat at an appalling rate  coupled with species over-exploitation, pollution, invasive species, climate change and rampant poaching. Yet these programmes are still made as if this worldwide mass extinction is simply not happening. The producers continue to go to the rapidly shrinking parks and reserves to make their films  creating a beautiful, beguiling fantasy world, a utopia where tigers still roam free and untroubled, where the natural world exists as if man had never been. By fostering this lie they are lulling the huge worldwide audience into a false sense of security. If David Attenborough is still making these sorts of wonderful shows then it cant be that bad, can it? Yes it can, and its going to get much, much worse. Even as Planet Earth II was being broadcast, it was reported that elephant and lion numbers were tumbling, and last month it became clear that the giraffe could be heading towards extinction, with numbers plummeting by 40% in the past 15 years. But no hint of the continuing disaster is allowed to shatter the illusion. Im not for one moment suggesting such shows should not be made. They are wonderful records of the beauty rapidly disappearing from our planet. I believe that in 100 years people will be amazed, and profoundly sad, that it was still possible to make such programmes. What I am suggesting is that the fantasy should be balanced by reality. I would like to propose a conservation tax among natural history commissioners across all channels. This tax would insist that a fifth of natural history commissions are significantly conservation-oriented. As a matter of urgency, a development team should be set up to think how the reality of whats happening to wildlife worldwide can be portrayed in innovative ways, integrated in dramas, in childrens shows  in collaborations with producers like Aardman Animations, perhaps, or video diaries of inspirational people working with animals, and cartoon characters. Some shows could be overtly conservation-oriented, others more subtle  perhaps a detective drama where the villains are smuggling rhino horn or ivory. But why would any TV development team put effort into imaginative conservation programming when escapist productions are so successful  unless it were taxed? The BBC is in a unique position to work with a conservation tax. It could do this as part of its public service remit, without having quite the financial pressure and need for profit that independents and commercial producers do. It would also be a very positive initiative for the BBC to be seen to be doing. We cannot simply carry on producing escapist wildlife fantasy almost totally ignoring the manmade mass extinction raging around us.','entertainment'),(66,'1 Josephine Baker hits Brixton Patience Agbabi makes language swing as she imagines an encounter with the 1920s singer, dancer and political activist Josephine Baker in Brixton, London.

Although the bird in this poem is generic, casually evoked as the thing with feathers, it somehow achieves a real presence. The small bird of Hope asks nothing, survives extremity and never ceases to sing the tune without the words. Paradoxically, this must be one of the most often-memorised poems ever written. Hope is the thing with feathers Hope is the thing with feathers -- That perches in the soul -- And sings the tune without the words -- And never stops -- at all -- And sweetest -- in the Gale -- is heard -- And sore must be the storm -- That could abash the little Bird That kept so many warm -- Ive heard it in the chillest land -- And on the strangest Sea -- Yet -- never -- in Extremity, It asked a crumb -- of me.

My science teacher once told me I wasnt good enough for science and look at me now. In the 1970s and early 80s Rubin, who has died aged 88, established that the stars in the outer regions of galaxies move at similar speeds to those in the middle, a result that led to the hypothesis that most of the universe is invisible, the cosmos filled with dark matter, mysterious stuff whose nature is still unknown. During recent years she became a popular favourite for a Nobel prize, but never received the accolade. Having battled sex discrimination throughout her career, she became an inspiration for women in science. In the outer regions of the solar system, far away from the sun where the force of its gravity is more feeble than hereabouts, planets move more slowly than the Earth. Were Uranus to move as fast as us, it would escape from the solar system entirely, its centrifugal thrust too large for the weakened inwards gravitational pull from the sun. This has been understood since Isaac Newton in the 17th century, and is a cornerstone of Einsteins general relativity: bodies orbiting a central mass will have speeds that fall in proportion to the square root of their distance from the centre. Many galaxies of stars form spirals, where relatively few stars in the outer arms orbit around a dense mass of stars at the centre. Here too, the laws of gravity imply that the outer stars should move relatively slowly compared to those nearer the central mass. But when Rubin mapped the motion of stars in spiral galaxies, she discovered that, far from slowing with distance from the centre, they moved at similar speeds, or even travelled faster the further out they were. Rubins results implied that the galaxies are rotating so fast that they should fly apart. Either Newtons law of gravitational attraction, and by implication Einsteins general relativity, form an incomplete description on cosmic scales, which would be truly revolutionary, or there are vast volumes of unseen matter that provide additional gravitational grip on the stars. This unseen stuff has become known as dark matter  dark in that it does not shine in the electromagnetic spectrum at any wavelength. The concept of dark matter has become one of the most exciting insights into our place in the universe. Where Copernicus removed the earth from the centre of the universe in the 16th century, and the discovery of galaxies in the 20th century showed our sun and Milky Way to be mere bit players in the cosmos, Rubins discovery seemingly implies that matter, as we know it, consisting of atomic electrons, protons and neutrons, is but flotsam on a vast sea of dark matter. Current estimates are that dark matter outweighs our stuff by a factor of five to 10. So, following Rubins breakthrough, we now believe that we are not even made of the same stuff as most of creation. Vera was born in Philadelphia, younger daughter of Philip Cooper, an electrical engineer, and Rose Applebaum, who worked for the Bell Telephone Company. The family moved to Washington DC when Vera was 10, and it was there that she developed an interest in astronomy. She was attracted to Vassar College as an undergraduate because Maria Mitchell, the first American to discover a comet, had worked there. After gaining a BA in astronomy in 1948, her first choice for graduate school was Princeton, but she never received the graduate prospectus, as women were not admitted to the graduate programme until 1975. Instead she joined Cornell University. At Cornell in 1948 she met Robert Rubin, a fellow graduate student, whom she married. Following a masters at Cornell in 1951, she completed a doctorate at Georgetown University in 1954, where she studied the motion of galaxies. Edwin Hubble had discovered that galaxies are on the average rushing apart from one another, the key to the theory that the observable universe is the result of a big bang some 13.8bn years ago. Rubins thesis in 1954 showed that galaxies are not distributed uniformly throughout the universe, but tend to cluster and rotate around one another. Rubin became an inspiration for women in science, especially, and further afield. She had four children, and most of her early career as an astronomer was part-time, so that she could be at home by the time the children returned from school. All four of her children later gained doctorates in mathematics or the natural sciences. In 1964 Rubin became the first woman to use the Palomar Observatory in southern California. Her first discovery there was that it did not have toilet facilities for women. She returned to her office, cut some paper into the shape of a skirt and stuck it on the image of the person on the toilet door. It was at Palomar, in a series of papers during the 1970s and early 1980s, that she made her most famous discoveries. She became a staff member at the Carnegie Institute of Washington in 1965, and it was with a young Carnegie colleague, Kent Ford, that she determined the distribution of mass in spiral galaxies by measuring their speeds of rotation. Among many honours, she was a member of the US National Academy of Sciences, won the gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society  the first woman to have done so since Caroline Herschel in 1828  and asteroid 5726 Rubin was named after her. She received several honorary doctorates, including one from Princeton University half a century after having been barred from their graduate programme. Her husband died in 2008, and her daughter, Judy, in 2014. Rubin is survived by three sons, Allan, David and Karl, five grandchildren and a great-granddaughter.

Ludicrously, Southampton are playing for the third time in six days and Claude Puel has admitted it will be a struggle to juggle his resources at Goodison Park. Tom Davies, sharp as a substitute at Hull City on Friday, may get a chance to start in Evertons midfield, with Koeman keen to protect Gareth Barry from two games in quick succession.

He scored one try and was denied another by a wing Jones selected ahead of him, Jack Nowell. It was like Harry Potter had given him his cloak of invisibility, said the Exeter head coach, Rob Baxter. We couldnt lay a hand on him. It was Nowell, though, who collected the man-of-the-match award after the Chiefs, 11-0 down and looking out of it after an hour, staged a remarkable comeback, winning at the Rec in the league for the first time through the replacement wing James Shorts two tries in the final seven minutes. Nowell was involved in the second, looking as if he would make it to the line before being tackled by Tom Homer. When Exeter moved the ball left, Gareth Steenson defied another Homer challenge to pass the ball through his legs and it bounced kindly for Short to cross unopposed and condemn Bath to their first home defeat of the season. The performances of Rokoduguni and Nowell explained Englands initial selection. For all his menace with the ball in hand and his ability to confound defenders by stepping round them as well as going through them, the Bath wing was less polished in defence and was caught out for Exeters first try. As Luke Cowan-Dickie juggled with the ball after George Ford had tried to dislodge it after the hooker had got through two tackles, Rokoduguni was drawn towards him and out of position when the ball was slipped to Short, who shrugged off the wings challenge to score. Nowell, in contrast, made his tackles count in an all-round display of excellence. Rokoduguni looked certain to score after catching his own chip from 60 metres and getting close to the line before the Exeter wing brought him down and turned him on his back to prevent the ball being grounded. After the interval, he thwarted another move sparked by George Ford, who from Sunday is free to talk to other clubs as he ponders a move away from Bath, and brought Jonathan Joseph to ground as the centre anticipated breaking into space. I am finally getting back into my stride, said Nowell, who missed the autumn internationals through an injury sustained in Englands October camp in Brighton. Rob Baxter had a few words to say to us at half-time because we had slipped off tackles and in the second half we took it to them. Rob has put a lot of pressure on us in the last couple of weeks because in past seasons we have tended to drop off around the Christmas period, but we followed our victory over Leicester with success at Bath and we can look forward to going to Saracens next weekend. Baths director of rugby, Todd Blackadder, was left to reflect on an impressive attacking display that yielded a mere bonus point after the loss of three props with head injuries, including Nathan Catt who had little more than an hour before been named in Englands squad, left them a player short in the final minutes as they were forced to go to uncontested scrums under rules designed to stop teams getting battered up front feigning injuries. Bath are struggling to find four fit props for Fridays trip to Newcastle and will be without their No8 Taulupe Faletau, who has suffered the recurrence of a knee-ligament injury, for a month after which he will join up with Wales for the Six Nations. Zach Mercer deputised against Worcester and the 19-year-old stood out with his footwork, off-loading and anticipation. All three props stayed off the field through the safety protocols in place and it is something that needs to be looked at down the line, said Blackadder. We were really clinical up to the hour mark [when Nick Auterac became the third prop to leave with a head injury] and while Exeter hung in there and all credit to them, it was a frustrating defeat. Ford had been at his impish best in that hour, helping Bath outwit opponents who ended the afternoon leapfrogging them into third place in the table. Asked if he had lined up a replacement outside-half, Blackadder said: We have a few irons in the fire but it depends what Georges decision is. It would have to be someone of high quality if George is to leave us.

I was stuck in a rut at Bolton, training was the same all the time, things werent going the way I planned, he revealed. Hopefully thats going to change here. It didnt change there: at the end of the following season, 18 months, 12 league starts and three goals after his arrival, he left for Leeds on a free transfer. 2004 Jos Antonio Reyes, Sevilla to Arsenal, 20m When Jos Antonio Reyes arrived he declared he was the happiest man in the world, but at the same time the saddest, suggesting an emotional attachment to his homeland he could never quite shake off. His time in London started well but then came a match at Old Trafford in which Gary Neville roughed him up a bit: Im not going to deny an element of intimidation. Reyes couldnt handle the rough and tumble. He didnt score again for four months, never reached his former heights and left in 2006. 2005 Jean-Alain Boumsong, Rangers to Newcastle, 8.2m Rangers owned Boumsong for only six months, in which time his value somehow increased from free to more than 8m. He has a great desire to be the best, said Graeme Souness, and the manager remained loyal to the blunder-prone centre-back for as long as the board were loyal to him, a little over a year. Six months after that the Frenchman was sold for a near-5m loss. When Im good, nobody talks about it, he complained. All right, Im no Beckenbauer but with time Ive figured out what I can do and what I cant. One list, sadly, was much longer than the other. 2006 Hossam Ghaly, Feyenoord to Tottenham After 16 months and 17 league starts, Ghaly came on in the 29th minute of a game against Blackburn, was taken off again in the 60th, tossed his shirt at Martin Jol on his way off the pitch and threw away his Spurs career in an instant. That summer Birmingham bought him for 3m but they found a way to cancel the deal after he fell out with Steve Bruce inside three days. He nearly played for Spurs again in January 2009, when he was named on the bench, but fans booed him so furiously he was sold to al-Nassr within weeks. 2007 Julius Aghahowa, Shakhtar Donetsk to Wigan, 3.5m As the end of January 2007 approached Wigan were bottom and on a run of eight successive league defeats. Theres no disguising it  were in the shit, surmised their manager, Paul Jewell. Enter Aghahowa, a fleet-footed Nigerian whose acrobatic goal celebration had made him one of the breakout stars of the 2002 World Cup. Paul Jewell insisted the club had really done our homework on this one and that he had watched him personally on two occasions. Wigans fans didnt see much more of him: a little over a year, three managers, a total of 23 appearances and not a single goal after his arrival he left again. 2008 Afonso Alves, Heerenveen to Middlesbrough, 12.7m In 2006 Manchester City signed the hapless Greek striker Georgios Samaras; in 2014 Cardiff spent 2m on Magnus Wolff Eikrem, who played nine times before having his contract cancelled; and in 2008 Middlesbrough spent nearly 13m on Alves. All three players were bought from Heerenveen, a club that should be avoided at all costs by spendthrift English chairmen. Alves scored 48 goals in 50 appearances in the Netherlands; he had a few (approximately two) good days in his season and a half in England, before he turned up late to pre-season training in the summer of 2010 and Boro swiftly sold him at a 6m loss. 2009 Savio Nsereko, Brescia to West Ham, 9m West Ham boasted that they had beaten off fierce competition for the German striker, player of the tournament in the European Under-19s Championship the previous year. What followed was a period in which, by his own admission, the player lost grip on reality. He certainly lost grip on his first-team place, starting once before the season ended and immediately being offloaded to Fiorentina at a loss of over 6m. He never played for the Italian side, enduring a series of failed loans that included one at 1860 Munich, cancelled when he went missing for a week before being discovered in his sisters house, and another at Juve Stabia when he disappeared to Thailand and allegedly faked his own kidnapping. 2010 Michel, Sporting Gijn to Birmingham, 3m Halfway through the month this was still the biggest deal completed by any Premier League club. His new manager, Alex McLeish, announced that the Spaniard is in a great age group and has got good legs. Less encouragingly, the Scot also revealed he would probably come to realise he might have a problem getting into the team. And so it transpired, with the arrival of Craig Gardner a few days later pushing him from third-choice central midfielder to fourth. He eventually started six games, and tasted another six as a substitute, before being sold to Getafe for half the price they paid for him. 2011 Jean Makoun, Lyon to Aston Villa, 6m This was the January of Januaries, the greatest ever top-flight transfer splurge. Torres and Carroll tend to hog the limelight, leaving forgotten disasters such as Tottenhams 1.5m move for Bongani Khumalo (Hes got potential, hes not expensive and we like him, said Harry Redknapp. Hes desperate for a chance, and were going to give him a chance. No they werent: four and a half years and not a single first-team appearance later they released him on a free transfer). Still, Makoun stood out among the more big-money, high-profile humiliations. Hes exactly what we need, said Grard Houllier after the deal for the midfielder was completed. Turns out he wasnt: seven league games, three bookings and a red card later he was gone. 2012 Marvin Sordell, Watford to Bolton, 3.2m Owen Coyle hijacked Sordells mooted move to Cardiff in a last-minute deadline-day intervention, and in the remainder of the season gave him three substitute appearances, all away from home, two lasting less than 10 minutes. The following season Sordell started the first three games and then hardly played until February, an absence his new manager, Dougie Freedman, blamed first on the players mental state  Hes homesick, there isnt even a fancy word for it  and then on his refusal to disconnect from social media. Hes got small issues off the field with his tweeting. It could be bordering on an obsession. He left for Burnley after 30 months and 13 starts. 2013 Vegard Forren, Molde to Southampton, 4.2m The Norwegian defender pulled out of a trial with Liverpool when Southampton agreed terms with Molde and declared the move a dream come true, insisting he was no Forren mercenary. Theres no doubt that this is where I want to be, he beamed. There is a good, young squad here and the way they play fits me well. Not for long it didnt. On the very day his transfer was completed Southampton sacked Nigel Adkins and replaced him with Mauricio Pochettino. That summer, no appearances later, his agent declared his player was patient, ready and committed to the Southampton cause. Three weeks later he returned to Molde. 2014 Kostas Mitroglou, Olympiakos to Fulham, 12.4m In the first half of the 2013-14 season Mitroglou had scored 14 goals in 12 league games and a Champions League hat-trick, while Arsne Wenger described him as a true finisher who cant be ignored. It turned out he could be ignored: in the second half of that season, following his switch to Fulham, there was one start, two substitute appearances, a couple of knee injuries and no goals. He wasnt helped by the fact that Ren Meulensteen, the manager who signed him, had been replaced by Felix Magath by the time he made his debut; that summer he went back to Olympiakos on loan. 2015 Andrej Kramaric, Rijeka to Leicester, 9.7m On 7 January 2015, the day they completed the club-record signing of the Croat, Leicester were bottom of the league with three wins in 20 games. None of their subsequent success can be accredited to a forward who scored twice in his first half-season under Nigel Pearson, after which Claudio Ranieri arrived, announced that he was a fantastic player but at this moment I choose another kind of striker and proceeded to give him only 22 minutes action. The player insisted that fans are sorry I do not play. They are very fond of me, though given their teams results they might just have been delirious. A year after his arrival, he departed for Hoffenheim on a loan that became permanent for an undisclosed fee. 2016 Oumar Niasse, Lokomotiv Moscow to Everton, 13.5m Roberto Martnez acclaimed Niasses real hunger and desire to be successful but still picked him to start only two league games. Of the 13 remaining matches between his arrival and the end of last season he was active for just 19 minutes, 14 of them in a game against West Ham in which Everton were 2-0 up when he came on, and 3-2 down at the final whistle. He has no squad number for this season, though hes had a few games for the under-23s, whose manager, David Unsworth, thinks the striker is outstanding, that his work rate has been incredible and that he needs to carry on what hes been doing. Namely, not much.','sport'),(71,'The playlist: Diana Ross got me singing at the top of my voice Music critic Alexis Petridis on how to find the right jogging tunes Before I started running, lots of people gave me advice, and all of it turned out to be true. Yes, I found running weirdly addictive. Yes, it provided me with a sense of mental equilibrium: I felt better physically, but also psychologically. Yes, the runners high is a real thing: a euphoric, fleeting rush of endorphins that feels remarkably like being on fantastic drugs, without the comedown. But they never mentioned music, which in retrospect seems odd. Among the pleasures of running  right up there with mental equilibrium and smug self-satisfaction  is the bizarrely intense relationship I feel with whatever Im listening to. Perhaps it has something to do with running putting you in a heightened, more receptive state; perhaps with the fact that you often concentrate intently on whats coming out of your headphones to keep your mind off how knackered you are. Whatever it is, its powerful. Songs have vaulted out of nowhere into my all-time-favourites list as a result of listening to them while I run. In some ways, its the aspect of running I look forward to the most, the thing that can get me out of the house when its cold or wet or I just dont feel like it. Certainly, I think music is too important a part of running to leave to others to control, although if you want to do that, there are plenty of options. Streaming services, still engaged in the faintly creepy task of trying to second-guess what you want to listen to, have acres of curated and continually updated exercise playlists: Go harder, better, faster and longer with these motivational EDM tracks. Yes, you CAN do it. You got this; The sound of sweatspiration  train hard and reap the rewards with a rootsy, motivating mix. These descriptions alone largely motivate me to go back to bed and pull up the covers  and thats before I even get to the music. In fairness, theres a pretty wide representation of genres on offer  fast folk and aggressive Americana, guaranteed to push your workout to the max offers one playlist, chillingly  but the vast majority appear to have been compiled by people steadfast in the belief that what you really want to listen to when youre exercising is awful pop-dance or terrible, shouty, I-didnt-ask-to-be-born-mum nu-metal. If thats your thing, fill your boots. But Ive got a feeling that, regardless of your tastes, you might be better off making your own running playlists than relying on algorithms. Whatever genre you opt for, Id go for a mix of new stuff, heavily laced with stuff you have at least some familiarity with: for some reason, I find the moment of happy recognition when a track you know and love kicks in gives you a quick energy boost. People seem to fuss about the tempo affecting how you run: there are playlists on which everything is around 170bpm, based on precisely this logic. But Ive never found that it matters. Ive run really fast and really well  by my standards, at least  while listening to late-70s and early-80s soul that was laid back to the point of sonnambulence. More affecting than speed is the tenor of the music. Given that the runners high usually seems to kick in after 40 minutes, Id strongly suggest loading that part of your playlist with music that might intensify this, although there are potential downsides to doing that, not least the spectacle you can make of yourself if you get carried away: I speak as a man who was once spotted by a friend running along the A23, in the throes of endorphin-induced euphoria, singing along to Diana Rosss I Aint Been Licked at the top of my voice, a sight said friend described as both deeply upsetting and impossible to erase from my memory. The motivator: We finish at a club for a beer and a dance Tim Jonze finds that the right coach can help in unlikely ways Music is fundamental to what we do, says Greg Drach, co-founder of the exercise group Midnight Runners. Its a legal performance-enhancer. Midnight Runners stage mass runs through the city streets after dark, with some joggers lugging boomboxes so everyone can listen to the same playlist. People run at different speeds, so music helps keep the group together, says Drach. Plus you cant hear your own breathing as much. Building exercise playlists can be less scientific than you might think. Drach says he started out picking Spotify playlists that adhered to a suitable 160-180bpm, but this didnt always work out. A lot of songs were terrible for running, he says. They just felt wrong, didnt get you pumping. Instead he opted for a more instinctive approach, and it turns out that being a music fan with an ear for a tune is essential, no matter how big the operation. Gillian Reeves, national group exercise manager at Virgin Active Health Clubs, says instructors spend hours sorting playlists, with the company even building a specialised platform from which to create them, using a constantly updated library of 50,000 tracks. One of the reasons participants come back, she says, is that they like your selection. It can transform exercise, which may seem tedious, into a theatrical, emotive experience. Chris Stanton, who runs The Pack spin classes at Virgin Active, says factors like bpm can be important when you want your class to find an extra gear  he tries to match the music to the required revolutions-per-minute during hill climbs, for instance. But Reeves and Stanton both tend to look beyond the numbers and, depending on the class, follow some simple rules: pick songs in which the verse and chorus provide natural intervals for you to catch your breath; use acoustic tracks to cool down as they provide less stimulation for the nervous system; make sure any lyrics complement the motivational atmosphere youre trying to create. Songs about sad times or breakups arent the best, says Reeves. The playlists Midnight Runners and Virgin use are pretty familiar. Both opt for subtlety-free EDM and chart-pop remixes with huge, arm-waving choruses: Avicii, Clean Bandit, Calvin Harris and DJ Snake feature on their more intense workout playlists, though Drach says he likes to throw in the occasional classic (so people can all sing along). Reeves, meanwhile, occasionally pays tribute to a legend: Earlier this year there were a lot of Prince tracks around the time he passed, in homage to such an inspiring artist. Clearly, the point isnt to make sure your muscles are straining in tandem to a robotic rhythm, but rather to ensure youre having fun. Indeed, Midnight Runners time their 11.30pm runs to finish at a party location, so that the exhausted runners can grab a recovery beer from the bar and shift the workout to the dancefloor. The Olympian: Beyonc as a pick-me-up, the Weeknd to chill out Dina Asher-Smith, 100m and 200m British record-holder, Olympic and World Championship bronze medallist, and history student Whether I am about to race in an Olympic final or the first heat of the British indoor championships, my choice of music will be designed to balance out what I am feeling. So if I am nervous, Ill put on something soothing. But if Im tired  if its day five of the Olympics and I need energy from somewhere  Ill listen to something that picks me up. I know the level of arousal I need to be at my best. Music helps me get into that zone. In the past, Ive tried being really hyper before I compete  it doesnt work. Ive also tried being really calm  again, it doesnt work. You have to be somewhere in the middle. So I have a bunch of playlists. If I need to chill out, Ill listen to the Weeknd, slow R&amp;B and old skool classics  TLC and stuff like that. If I want to pick myself up, its Beyonc, grime, Jay Z, Kanye West  stuff that is empowering and gets you thinking. Unlike many athletes, I dont listen to music when Im training or warming up. Yes, rhythm is really important. But when I run, I have to feel the patterns of what Im doing without accompanying music  because when you race, you dont have Jay Z pounding out on the track with you. That said, sometimes I will put my headphones on with no music. I know it sounds funny, but it is like a symbol of being in the zone. Its like: I need my own space here. Otherwise, you get people saying: Hey! Thats fine 99% of the time but not when theres an Olympic medal on the line. Sometimes if Im cold when training in the winter, Ill also use my headphones as earmuffs! Im currently in the final year of a history degree at Kings College, London, so when I am writing an essay I will always listen to Classic FM, as its music keeps me focused without distracting me  most of the time, there are no words to sing along to. Im going to write my dissertation on jazz in 20th-century America. Until recently, I didnt listen to much jazz  I chose the topic more because of the race relations and interaction with popular culture.

Interview by Sean Ingle More uplifting culture for 2017','sport'),(72,'For three decades, with barely a blip, the UK capital has been going from strength to strength. Nothing has stunted its potency and growth, not the 7/7 bombings or the 2011 riots, not Black Monday or the 2008 global crash, not even the original Millennium Dome. Its economy drives and subsidises the rest of the country, its still-new tier of regional government  the mayoralty and the Greater London Authority (GLA)  has been a success and it has hosted a triumphant Olympic Games. Its population, after shrinking through years of managed decline, is now at an all-time high, and might hit 10 million by 2030. But London enters 2017 with a question mark after its name. Might its golden age be coming to an end? After the fireworks, the New Year begins amid unaccustomed unease. The heavy, grey cloud above is Brexit, with major employers in an international city whose wealth has been built on financial services pondering their options for the future. Meanwhile, austerity, albeit moderated by Miliband-ish measures from Theresa May, continues to erode from below. It doesnt lighten the general mood that armed police officers have become a routine feature of everyday London life. In all these circumstances optimism is essential, but staving off its opposite will require fortitude and skill. The mayor, of course, has a big part to play in all of this. Sadiq Khans 2017 will involve the Labour man in unending nagging of and negotiating with the Conservatives in charge of national government, hoping to secure the best possible post-Brexit deal for the capital and, by extension, the country. His panel of Brexit advisors, bankers, accountants, Peter Mandelson and all, doesnt delight those who think hes insufficiently left-wing. But pragmatism is an essential mayoral art: if you want a bunch of Tories to take you seriously, you dont surround yourself with Corbynites. Policy delivery will begin with Khan hailing a freeze on those public transport fares that Transport for London (TfL) sets, but not the universal one some of his election campaign statements and a line in his manifesto claimed. Political opponents will attack him (again) for that, and for the demands he is making on TfLs finances as a whole as his first mayoral budget, covering all GLA functions, comes under closer public scrutiny. Khans new hopper fare, which enables bus passengers to catch two buses for the price of one during a 60 minute period, has given him - not to mention a lot of Londoners on low incomes - a quick early win. But this initiative, though welcome, needs to be seen in the context of falling bus ridership, something TfL can ill afford given its increasing dependence on fares revenue. This, in turn, is a consequence of worsening road traffic congestion, which Londons economy could do without. Congestion also harms air quality, another issue the mayor has sought to make a fast start on. He is set to kick-off implementing his anti-pollution policies by introducing an emissions surcharge (the so-called T-charge on toxicity) on high-pollution vehicles entering the congestion charge zone early in 2017, but will be urged by critical friends to go further with his policies as a whole. Holding down public transport fares is one part of a broader attempt to address Londons high cost of living, which leaves too many of its households, including around 40% of its children, struggling to make ends meet on unacceptably low pay and excluded from many of the citys riches. Housing costs are, famously, a huge factor in this and also hugely difficult to control. The mayors housing team has assembled a purposeful strategy for getting more homes built for sale, rent or a combination of both at prices ordinary Londoners can afford. Khan will hope to be able to boast of initial successes as he embarks on the vast task of trying to better match housing delivery to the citys social and economic need. The backdrop to all this is the ongoing three-year monster mission of writing a new London Plan. There are going to be tensions. Hammered by successive grant cuts and hampered by limits on their freedom to borrow to build, some of the capitals boroughs, often Labour-run, are becoming ever more adroit at finding ways to meet at least some local affordable housing demand, but these can mean private sector partnerships involving publicly owned land that dont always work as well as planned. The available alternatives - largely, small variations on doing nothing - arent all that attractive either. Squeezed between the same rock and hard place we find shortages of school places and health and social care provision also having their impact at borough, and indeed neighbourhood level. Dynamic boroughs and the mayor alike are trying to get more more purchase on low-cost childcare and improving post-school skills training, as the city strives for greater autonomy in the running of its affairs. A striking thing about the politics of London is the high degree of consensus about the benefits of devolving power over such things as welfare programmes, property taxes and infrastructure investment from Whitehall. Agreement crosses party lines and unifies business interests, social sector campaigners and more. There is strength in that solidarity. London will need every ounce of it to keep on prospering in 2017 and beyond.','business'),(73,'Manchester United head to the London Stadium after five straight victories and unbeaten in their last 12 matches.

A second away win by this margin in four days could not have been more convenient preparation for Chelseas visit to White Hart Lane on Wednesday and any suggestion that they might take their eye off the ball against opponents with previous for inconveniencing bigger names was quickly rendered unnecessary by the sheer paucity of Watfords offering. It is hard to imagine that a home side will play this inadequately during the rest of 2017. Injuries had played havoc with Walter Mazzarris plans, but that does not completely excuse the sluggishness and basic errors that peppered the performance of a relatively experienced starting XI. Tottenham were merciless in response and seized upon the home sides repeat offences, the snatched clearance from Youns Kaboul that teed up Dele Alli to score a third goal  and end any lingering doubts over the outcome  four minutes before half-time providing a faithful snapshot of the afternoons events. None of that is to detract from the encouragement Tottenham, whose four-game winning run gives the impression of a team easing into gear after a patchy autumn, will take from a match they controlled entirely. Alli, recapturing last seasons levels of effervescence, was a delight to watch and Mauricio Pochettino will have been equally happy that he could rest his midfielder for the last third of the game. Harry Kane looked as sharp as at any time this season and then there was the performance of Kieran Trippier, who has been a forgotten man due to the excellence of Kyle Walker but took advantage of his team-mates suspension to lay on both of Kanes goals. He remains one of the divisions most technically gifted right-backs and this was a reminder that Spurs possess important depth in what, for them, is a vital area of the pitch. Trippier had already created a chance for Danny Rose when, spotting Kanes angled run in the inside-right channel, he met it with a clever pass round the defence. Kane beat Heurelho Gomes confidently and from then on it was a question of how many Tottenham would score. Six minutes later it seemed anyones guess. Trippiers next trick was a wonderful, half-volleyed cross from the right flank that bypassed the home centre-backs for Kane to jab home emphatically. Watford players were not without reproach, Kane showing far more hunger than the two he beat to the ball, but the delivery had been virtually unplayable. It was a perceptive, first-time switch across field from Alli that supplied Trippier with the time and space to centre. That was entirely characteristic of the midfielders performance, which could have been crowned by a spectacular goal when a 25-yard shot rapped the bar seconds before Kane opened the scoring, but was still rewarded soon enough. Alli was deft, alert, brain and feet operating yards ahead of anybody in a yellow shirt. Craig Cathcart might have prevented him from seizing on to Kabouls mistake, but this was a day when 50-50 contests had only one winner and his finish was unerring. There was a similar outcome when, found with half of the penalty area at his disposal from Kanes cross 58 seconds into the second half, Alli was faced with Gomes a second time. The result was the same and had the option been available, both sides would surely have wound things up there and then. Watfords supporters had booed after the third goal but saw the rest of the game out as quietly as their team. Much as Kabouls scrambled injury-time consolation was insignificant, it was a jolt to the senses inasmuch as they had never threatened anything of the sort. We were growing during the season and then out of nowhere we miss five very important members of the team, said the Watford manager. If you took that number from any other team in the Premier League they would also be in big difficulty. Mazzarri had said before the game that he needed a priest to rid Watford from a litany of problems that had included early injuries to Daryl Janmaat and Valon Behrami in the Boxing Day draw with Crystal Palace. Nobody with access to a higher power appeared to have listened; Watford were forced into a reshuffle when Camilo Ziga suffered an ankle injury in the warm-up and that set the tone for their afternoon. Zigas replacement, Odion Ighalo, went on to underline the sense that the form with which he began 2016 was very much against the norm. The task for Tottenham is to make sure that this level of performance becomes a regular occurrence against better opposition. It was nearly a perfect game, Pochettino said, and more of the same against the leaders on Wednesday would give the next 51 weeks a tough act to follow in improving on this first one.','sport'),(76,'Liverpool have won their past four matches, the most recent of which was against Manchester City.

Watford get a goal in added time, with Kaboul sliding in a free-kick at the second attempt after a brilliant save from Lloris. 90 min A bit of ol football from Spurs takes us into added time. Theyve scored eight goals away from home in five days; not bad preparation for Wednesdays humdinger at home to Chelsea. 87 min The tempo is much slower now. Spurs are content to pass the time rather than try to score a fifth. 84 min A well-worked free-kick from Watford releases Kaboul on the left of the box, and his volleyed cross is acrobatically claimed by Lloris. Thats the first significant thing hes had to do in the match. 82 min Janssen screams with pain as Cathcart plants studs onto the top of his foot. Cathcart is booked. 80 min Hey Rob, heres my review of the year, says Kevin Smith. Manager of the Year: obviously its Bob Bradley. Hands down. I mean, just look at Swansea - 8 of 33 points (24%) with him, 4 of 24 (17%) without him. Player of the Year: Scott Arfield, because its nice to have a Canadian in the premier league again. Disappointment of the Year: Sticking with the Canadian thing, the lack of consideration Christine Sinclair gets for womens player of the year. More international goals than anyone other than Abby Wambach (and shes only 19 back), led Canada to a 2nd Olympic bronze as well as a domestic title, shes still never finished higher than 5th in voting, and this year will be at best 4th. The top 3 includes Marta and Carli Lloyd, neither of whom got a medal in the Olympics, with Marta only scoring one goal (a penalty) the entire tournament. 79 min Watfords final substitution: Capoue off, Christian Kabasele on. 78 min Spurs make their final substitution: Kane off, Vincent Janssen on. 77 min Son continues to not score. First the last man Doucoure makes a vital interception; then Son lashes a bouncing ball over the bar. 74 min Amrabat winces his way off the field to be replaced by Jerome Sinclair. 73 min Amrabat bumps Wanyama over while protecting the ball and then collapses himself in the comedy style. Hes going to go off. 70 min The youngster Mason does well to deny Son a shooting chance after a fine long pass from Wimmer. 68 min A substitution for each side. Watford bring on the teenager Brandon Mason for Jose Holebas, who is on a yellow card, while Spurs introduce Ben Davies for the ever excellent Danny Rose. 67 min Trippier is continuing, though he doesnt look particularly comfortable. He fell awkwardly after a challenge with Holebas. 66 min Trippier is struggling with a shoulder injury and might need to go off. 64 min The fear, says Peter McLeod. Sure, well always have it, and with good reason. It was super Spursy to qualify for the Champions League, book Wembley for our home matches and then go and lose the first two. But we need to have some perspective. Back in the late 90s Spursiness consisted of trying to copy Arsenal by getting a fancy foreign manager, then watching as Wenger racked up Doubles while Christian Gross almost got us relegated. Some fans complain about the Levy era but its been a dream compared to what came before. 63 min Prodl is booked for a foul from behind on Son. 61 min Dele Alli is substituted with Chelsea in mind. He played beautifully, scoring twice and smashing a long-range shot off the bar. Harry Winks replaces him. 59 min Deeney, put through on goal by Prodl, is erroneously flagged offside. Morally speaking, its now Watford 1-4 Tottenham Hotspur. 58 min Hai Rob! says Arief. Im watching Spurs in Klaten, Indonesia now. What do you think are the chances of Harry Kane surpassing Thierry Henrys 59 goals in first 100 appearances in the second half? Ordinarily Id say its unlikely but with the way Watford are defending he could easily get the 58 goals he needs. 57 min Agents Kabul and Gomes seem to have done their job, not forgetting Capoue who is joining in by being totally invisible, says John Tumbridge. Surely now is the opportunity to get Carter-Vickers on and see how he is in the Premier League and Janssen in the hope it will bounce off his backside and he can score without requiring a penalty. 56 min Kane curls it low around the wall, and Gomes gets down smartly to his left to push it wide. I think it would have hit the outside of the post anyway. 55 min Capoue commits an offensively brainless foul on Rose 20 yards from goal. Eriksen usually takes free-kicks but Kane is on a hat-trick... 53 min Heres Mark Turner. Manager of the Half Year: Allardyce. You want entertainment? Big Sam got your entertainment. Player of the Half Year: Hazard. Nailed on. Cant even think of a jokey alternative. Disappointment of the Half Year: John Stones still being taken seriously as a defender. 52 min Son slices wide of the near post after another fine move. I assume Spurs will declare soon, with Wednesdays match against Chelsea in mind, but for now they look like scoring every time they attack. 49 min Doucoures low cross finds Deeney eight yards out with his back to goal, but he dithers and loses possession. 48 min I was very disappointed when the FA deemed Big Sam too spicy but then the Premier League is more fun with him so lets say hes my pick for manager, says Phil Podolsky. Best player? Always liked that Yaya fella.  What, Sanogo?  Dele Alli makes it four after 58 seconds of the second half. Its another shocker for Watford. Prodl gives the ball away to Kane, who crosses to find Alli in his own personal postcode at the far post. He takes a slightly heavy touch but gets to the ball before Gomes and slides it under him with his left foot. 46 min Following here in Vadodara, India, rooting for my Spurs, says Rich Zumkhawala-Cook. Is Trippier playing as well all over the pitch as he is in attack? The moment he has any defending to do, Ill let you know. 46 min Peep peep! Spurs begin the second half. Ill see your 3-4 and raise you a 3-5, says John Dalby. I didnt like to mention that. No team deserves to be reminded of being terrorised by Juan Sebastian Veron. Matt Lotens half-year awards Manager of the Half Year: Tony Pulis, because not even West Brom fans seem to give this man the love that he deserves. Not sure about his financial nous, mind, but Im choosing to keep off-field issues out of my decision. Player of the Half Year: Zlatan Ibrahimovic. To do what hes doing, at his age, in this league, is nothing short of astonishing. Context: The last Manchester United player to score 16 goals before Christmas was a 26 year-old Ruud van Nistelrooy. Disappointment of the Half Year: Crystal Palace doing away with stripes for their home kit. Its just wrong, I tell you. If Norwich were still in the top flight, though, itd be their third kit. Half-time reading (optional, encouraged) And the scoreline flatters Watford. See you in 10 minutes to see how many more Spurs can get. 45 min Spurs know better than most about the dangers of a 3-0 half-time lead. I think theyll be okay today though. 44 min Holebas is booked for a bad tackle on Eriksen. This could end up a darts score. Kaboul mishits a clearance across his own box, Alli beats Cathcart to the loose ball and slides it calmly under Gomes. Spurs have been entirely magnificent today. 40 min If you need some space and time filler, how about if we choose our mid-season award winners? says Hubert OHearn. My idea so I get to go first: Manager of the Half Year: Has to be Conte. Player of the Half Year: Diego Costa. In large part this is why Conte is Manager of the season - hes transformed the little ball of hate into the best striker in the Premier League. Disappointment of the Half Year: Leicesters title defence ... but we love them anyway. Was Leicester a disappointment? It was pretty predictable. I agree with the first two. My main disappointment of the half year? Alton Towers. 39 min Son misses a great chance to make it 3-0. He met Eriksens inswinging free-kick on the volley, 10 yards out, but slid it fractionally wide of the near post. 36 min Wanyama places his studs down the back of Amrabats leg, which gives Watford a free-kick. It lobs around the box for a bit until Alderweireld mistimes a header back towards his own goal. Deeney looks set to score until Kane appears to clear the danger. Who does he think he is, Roy Race? 35 min I bloody love this Spurs team. There is so much to admire about them. Two goals for Kane, two assists for Tripper. This time he produced a sensational right-wing cross, larruping it into the six-yard on the box on the half-volley, and Kane muscled his way between two defenders to volley into the net. That is a brilliant goal. 32 min A Spurs fan mate of mine is at Cheltenham races this afternoon, says Mark Turner. Im busy winding him up, so far told him that Watford are 2-0 up via an Alderweireld own goal and a Guedioura screamer. Will happily take suggestions for Chapter 3 of the wind-up (at some point hell check the interwebs and the fun is over). Happy New Year, Rob. Better still, tell him Spurs are 1-0 up and playing brilliantly. If that doesnt give a Spurs fan the fear, I dont know what will. 30 min Spurs are rampant. Allis majestic scooped pass over the defence almost puts Kane clear, with Prodl making a desperate and vital challenge. Seconds after Alli hits the bar, Kane gives Spurs the lead. Trippier, on the right wing, played a clever pass around the defence to put Kane through on goal, and he calmly placed it over the diving Gomes. 27 min Alli hits the bar with a brilliant rising drive from 25 yards. It was moving away from Gomes all the time and clattered off the bar. A goal is coming... 25 min Two of Tottenhams centre-backs almost combine for a goal in open play. Alderweireld drives an angled pass over the top of the defence to put Dier clear. He has the chance to loop a header over Gomes, lurking in no-mans land, but instead tries to head down to a team-mate and the chance goes. Moments later, Eriksen rifles just over the bar from 20 yards. Gomes had it covered. 24 min Im out there, says Richard Wood. Getting your coverage from Middleton, south Australia. Can we get Mike Dean in to give that penalty? Hes not actually the referee today, though such semantics neednt be an impediment to him awarding a couple of penalties for shirt-pulling. 23 min Eriksens square pass is dummied neatly by Alli, allowing Rose to maraud onto the ball, control it with his left foot just inside the area - and then splatter a right-footed shot miles over the bar. 21 min 20 min This game is not very entertaining. 16 min Anyone out there? 14 min Watford havent got going at all in attack. At the other end, Kane wallops a 30-yard shot not too far wide of the far post. Gomes knew it was going wide and didnt make an attempt to save. 10 min Spurs are beginning to control the match. Roses cutback finds Eriksen, whose hopelessly mishit shot slams off the outstretched hand of Capoue and behind for a corner. Some referees would have given a penalty there. That said, Eriksens appeal might have been an attempt to distract attention from the fact his shot was going approximately four miles wide of goal. 8 min Amrabat is a bit lucky not to be booked for a clumsy hack at Rose. 7 min Eriksen finds Son in space, 25 yards from goal. He moves infield and curls a decent left-footed shot that is comfortably held by the sprawling Gomes. 4 min Both sides have started busily, though nothing of note has happened. Youre welcome. 2 min Both teams are playing a back three, a formation that has come back from the dead in recent years. There are no right and wrong tactics, only fashionable and unfashionable ones. 1 min Watford kick off from right to left and welt the ball straight out of play. Happy new year! Here come the players. Its a grim day in Watford, with rain pelting down. Watford have had to make a last-minute change to their team: Juan Zuniga is injured so Odian Ighalo comes in. The first email of 2017! I trust Messrs Kaboul, Capoue, and Gomes wont forget that without their time at Spurs they would not now be playing for Watford, says John Tumbridge. They all have much to be grateful for. Is gratitude a legitimate defence in match-fixing cases? Some pre-match nostalgia Watford (3-5-2) Gomes; Kaboul, Prdl, Cathcart; Amrabat, Capoue, Guedioura, Doucoure, Holebas; Ighalo, Deeney. Substitutes: Pantilimon, Sinclair, Folivi, Kabasele, Mason, Stewart, Rowan. Tottenham Hotspur (3-5-2) Lloris; Dier, Alderweireld, Wimmer; Trippier, Eriksen, Wanyama, Alli, Rose; Son, Kane. Substitutes: Vorm, Carter-Vickers, Davies, Dembele, Winks, Sissoko, Janssen. Referee Michael Oliver. Hello, happy new year one and all. Whether in 2016 or 1900, Watford havent generally had the best of times against Spurs. Their list of defeats includes 7-0, 8-1, 5-0, 7-1, 6-3, 5-2  not to mention 4-1 in the famous 1987 FA Cup semi-final. Its 23 years since they last beat Spurs  and even that meant the square root of bugger all, because a 3-2 win in the second leg of their Coca-Cola Cup tie didnt quite compensate for a 6-3 shellacking in the first leg at Vicarage Road. That was then and this is now. Watford are an awkward side to face on their home soil - ask Manchester United, Everton and Leicester  but Spurs are an awkward side to face anywhere. They have only lost twice in the league all season and looked close to their exhilarating best in trouncing Southampton 4-1 last Wednesday. All told, this should be a good way to start a new year. Bloody better be because Im in no mood for another 2016. Kick off is at 1.30pm.','sport'),(78,'Chinas manufacturing sector expanded for a fifth month in December but growth was slightly less than expected, with government measures to curb soaring asset prices beginning to have an effect on the broader economy. The official purchasing managers index slipped from 51.7 in November to 51.4 last month, compared to forecasts in a Reuters poll of a figure of 51.5. A reading above 50 indicates that the economy is growing. A year ago the index was at 49.7, and the start of 2016 saw global markets spooked by worries of a severe slowdown in the worlds second largest economy, but since then it has been slowly recovering. A housing boom in the second half of 2016 and a government spending spree on infrastructure have helped boost prices for commodities, from cement to steel, giving the countrys manufacturing sector a much-needed lift. But the government is cracking down on speculative property buying, and signals from policymakers that more will be done to contain asset bubbles and rising debt  even at the expense of slower growth  suggest extra stimulus measures could be limited. [These] PMI figures suggest that the change of policy tone has taken its toll, as the authorities are seriously concerned about the asset bubbles, said Zhou Hao, senior economist at Commerzbank. Factory output slowed in December, with the sub-index hitting 53.3 compared with 53.9 the previous month. Total new orders were flat at 53.2, logging the same as in November, while new export orders fell to 50.1 from 50.3. Jobs were again lost, with the employment sub-index sitting at 48.9, compared to 49.2 in November, as the country pledged to cut excess capacity over a range of industries. The Markit/Caixin PMI, a private gauge of manufacturing activity which focuses more on small- and mid-sized firms, is due on 3 January. A separate reading on the services sector showed the pace of growth slowed in December. The official non-manufacturing PMI stood at 54.5 in December, down from 54.7 in November, but still well above the 50-point mark.','business'),(79,'Theyll miss Wilfred Ndidi  aka the teddy bear  in Genk. A combative character on the pitch; a shy, warm and grateful personality off it. During a team-building session an unsuspecting Ndidi once walked miles with a backpack stuffed with flowers after he left the zipper open. Behind him, all of his team-mates were laughing. For two years he had been their favourite victim but they all loved him because he was such a likable person. A charming guy who, having agreed to join Leicester City this month for 15m plus 3m in potential add-ons, leaves only good memories behind. A heart-winner, a ball-winner. The first person to fall in love with him? Roland Janssen, nowadays scouting for Manchester United in Belgium but formerly Genks head of scouting. In September 2013 Janssen was sitting on the sidelines of a pitch, somewhere in Nigerias biggest city, Lagos. Ten football academies from all over the country were taking part in a tournament. Flanked by scouts from Anderlecht and Villarreal, Janssen watched with full attention. More than 250 players gave the best of themselves but there was one he couldnt take his eyes off: a 16-year-old, lanky defender from Nath Boys. Wilfred Ndidi. He immediately caught my attention, Janssen would recall in the Brussels newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws. Before the final he played a game with his academy against a first division team from Lagos. The composure he had on the ball was atypical for an African player of that age. Usually, when they know that European scouts are watching them, they want to prove themselves too much. They dive into tackles at knee height. He didnt. He passed out from the back and, on a bad pitch, he launched some good long balls. A solid performance for a boy, who played against guys who were five-to-10 years older than him. He was only 16 but you could see his presence on the pitch. Janssen decided to arrange a trial in January 2014. The selection criteria for trial players were very strict in Genk  foreigners should be much better than the players coming through the youth ranks. The club had nurtured Kevin De Bruyne, Thibaut Courtois, Yannick Carrasco and Divock Origi. Ndidi, a son of a soldier, travelled to Belgium to train with the development squad, managed by Domenico Olivieri, a former Genk captain who had won the Belgian title and a cup with them. My first impression of him? I didnt have that feeling: Wow, this is a super talented guy, Olivieri has said. Not a player we had to sign immediately but one worth following. His jumping ability was phenomenal but in the passing exercises he was struggling a bit. After an exhibition game against Maastricht I changed my mind. That was the first time he gave me the impression he could become a top player. He thrived in ball-winning. His long legs were everywhere. Octopus-like. He was open-minded, too. He immediately integrated in the group, was open for advice and his work ethic was outstanding. There was a problem at that point. Genk could not sign Ndidi as clubs are not permitted to give a contract to non-EU players under 18. They had to wait a year, forcing Janssen to stay in touch with the player through email. He was very impatient, Janssen recalled. He really wanted to come to Genk. Ndidi also called Olivieri, who later told Het Laatste Nieuws: A month after his trial I suddenly get a call from a number with an unknown foreign country code. It turned out to be Ndidi. He wanted to thank me for the opportunity he had been given. Great, I thought. At that time he did not know that we would give him a contract. It was the first time that a trial player called me to say thanks. But thats his personality. In January 2015 the then head coach, Alex McLeish, and director of football, Gunter Jacob, decided to sign Ndidi and give him his first professional contract. The player finally moved to Belgium. We were having a meeting with Gunter and Roland, our head scout, McLeish later said. There was no money left. We had to sell players before we could sign on new ones. Roland spoke highly of a kid hed seen in Nigeria. We had to act quickly, he said. He showed me a video. Although you couldnt draw many conclusions out of those images, I had a feeling that the boy had something in him. Eventually Genk paid 78,000 for him. My only transfer turned out to be a good one. Only a month after Ndidi signed his contract, he made his full debut for Genk. He wasnt ready but an injury crisis forced McLeish to play him as a left-back against Charleroi on 31 January 2015. I still remember he had cramps after 70 minutes, McLeish said. Under Belgiums complicated end-of-season system, Genk did not qualify for Play-off I, the round that decides which team will be champions. It was a huge blow for the club but it turned out to be a blessing for Ndidi. In Play-off II a lot of youngsters got their chance for Genk and Ndidi was one of them. He made a good impression in central defence. McLeishs contract did not get extended but Ndidi sensed an opportunity and returned to preseason in top shape. Aged 18, he scored excellent marks in the physical tests, leading to the new manager, Peter Maes, coming up with a special plan for the player. Sergej Milinkovic-Savic would leave for Lazio, Bennard Kumordzi was injured, so I was looking for a defensive midfielder. I noticed he [Ndidi] had tremendous stamina. Ideal for my midfield. He would be my perfect guardian. We have many players who like to play the ball but he would bring balance to the team. And his passing skills were good enough, too. Ndidi shone in his new role, hoovering up balls like a vacuum cleaner. But he can read a game too, Maes would add. Remarkable for a boy of 19. Maes often compared him to the way Yaya Tour, who moved from the Ivory Coast to Belgium as a teenager, developed at Beveren. This boy can reach the European top, he said with utter conviction at the beginning of the year. Ndidi had won over everyone in the club: the board, the staff, the fans and his team-mates. Scouts from top clubs were now also keeping an eye on him. Chelsea sent one and Leicester scouts also became regulars at the Luminus Arena. A good campaign in the Europa League convinced the Premier League champions to throw his name on the table in their pursuit of a successor to NGolo Kant. In the group stages of the tournament, Ndidi made more tackles and interceptions than any other player and Leicester moved swiftly to tie up a deal for him at the start of last month. They paid what Genk wanted and what represented a jackpot for the club, given they signed Ndidi for 78,000 two years ago. Maes, the man behind that remarkable rise, was sacked at the end of last month. After his last game, against Gent, Ndidi wanted to say a special word for him: What will I remember from my period in Genk? Peter Maes. He made me a better player. He was hard on us but he wanted to get the best out of me. I will always miss the way he was barking at me. Genks loss is Leicesters gain.','sport'),(80,'A refugee support group in a small Cornwall town hopes to welcome two Syrian families after raising thousands of pounds. Bude Welcomes Refugees, a 30-person group based in the north Cornwall seaside resort, wants to be one of the earliest adopters of the community sponsorship scheme to resettle refugee families. The initiative enables community organisations, including charities, faith groups, churches and businesses, to take on the role of supporting resettled refugees in the UK. The group has applied for charity status and presented its plan to Cornwall council for approval, which is required to secure Home Office clearance. Richie Heard has been volunteering in an old RNLI lifeboat to save migrants and refugees attempting the crossing from Turkey to Greece. He said the initiative showed just how much love this part of the country has to give. The lifeguard, 32, who lives in Hartland, Devon, said: I think its great, I think its lovely, and the fact that its coming to Bude ... There are so many people I know that would love to come out and jump on that boat, and do what I do and help in such a dramatic way, I feel very lucky to have the skills and the opportunity to do it. But its given a lot of people here a great way to directly help these refugees who are coming across. I know so many people that have just dropped what theyre doing and started to raise money for these two families. And people here just absolutely cant do enough to help. I havent heard anyone cast a negative opinion on this scheme thats running. Theres obviously going to be one or two people with a snide comment, but I think thats born of ignorance. I think if you put most of these people in front of that Syrian family and asked them to judge again, theyd soon change their opinion. The group has raised more than 12,600 for the first of the two families it hopes to offer homes to, which will cover the cost of interpreters, English lessons and top-up fees for local authority rates paid for private accommodation. All organisations hoping to take part in the government scheme must be either registered charities or community interest companies, and have the consent of the local authority in which they wish to operate and a comprehensive plan for resettlement. Sponsors under the scheme provide housing for the refugee family, as well as helping them integrate into life in the UK and access medical and social services, arrange English language tuition and support them towards employment and self-sufficiency.','politics'),(81,'Ronda Rousey has received support from fellow high-profile athletes after her first-round defeat to Amanda Nunes on Friday night. Rousey who, along with Conor McGregor, is UFCs biggest draw was beaten in 48 seconds during her comeback. But Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James showed sympathy after her defeat. In sports, in general, they build you up as high as they can, put you on the highest mountain in the world, just to tear you down. Thats coming from somebody who has experienced it, James told the Akron Beacon Journal on Saturday. Thats a fact. I know exactly how she feels because I was that athlete. I went through that. James was heavily criticized after he left the Cavaliers to join Miami Heat, where he won three NBA titles. He won another title with the Cavs in 2016. LA Lakers legend Kobe Bryant also defended Rousey. Instead of clapping for @RondaRousey defeat give her a standing O for putting the sport on the map #pioneer #muse, he tweeted. Jon Jones, another UFC star currently facing adversity, also offered his thoughts on Rouseys situation. My advice to Ronda would be to pick yourself up and try again, Jones wrote on Twitter. I think its important for Ronda to show her fans how great she truly is by displaying her courage and giving it another try. What she does next will truly determine her legacy. I really hope she chooses to be unbroken. Her story doesnt have to be over here. I also still believe she beats 90% of the division. Lots of ass kicking still to be done, lots of money to be made. Jones, the former UFC lightweight champion, is currently serving a one-year doping suspension. Rousey, meanwhile, says she is taking time to consider her future. I want to say thank you to all of my fans who have been there for me in not only the greatest moments but in the most difficult ones. Words cannot convey how much your love and support means to me, Rousey said in a statement to ESPN. Returning to not just fighting, but winning, was my entire focus this past year. However, sometimes  even when you prepare and give everything you have and want something so badly  it doesnt work how you planned. I take pride in seeing how far the womens division has come in the UFC and commend all the other women who have been part of making this possible, including Amanda. I need to take some time to reflect and think about the future. Thank you for believing in me and understanding.','sport'),(82,'As 2016 withered away, our readers saw in the new year in a most underwhelming manner.

In remarks to reporters upon entering a New Years Eve celebration at his Mar-a-Lago estate on Saturday night, Trump warned against being quick to pin the blame on Russia for the hacking of US emails. I just want them to be sure, because its a pretty serious charge, he said. And if you look at the weapons of mass destruction, that was a disaster, and they were wrong. US intelligence officials have said that they are confident Russia was behind the US election hacks, which could have played a role in Trumps defeat over the Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. On Thursday Barack Obama announced tough measures against Moscow, including the expulsion of 35 diplomats and the closure of two compounds in the US. Russia chose not to respond in kind, prompting Trump to tweet praise of President Vladimir Putin, whom he called very smart. The Washington Post also reported on Friday that Moscow could be behind malware found on a laptop owned by a Vermont electricity utility. In response to that discovery, the Vermont governor, Peter Shumlin, said: One of the worlds leading thugs, Vladimir Putin, has been attempting to hack our electric grid, which we rely upon to support our quality of life, economy, health, and safety. At Mar-a-Lago, Trump said: I think its unfair if we dont know. It could be somebody else. I also know things that other people dont know so we cannot be sure. And so I want them to be sure. I think its unfair if they dont know. And I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove. So it could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people dont know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation. Asked what that information included, the president-elect said: You will find out on Tuesday or Wednesday. He did not elaborate, although in a statement released on Thursday in response to Obamas sanctions, he said he would meet intelligence officials. Trump has long questioned reports of Russian attempts to influence the election in his favour, saying hacks could have been perpetrated by China or lone hackers, and repeated a desire for the country to move on. On Saturday, he went on to say no computer is safe from hacking and suggest that using a pen and paper was the most effective way of exchanging information. If you have something really important, write it out and have it delivered by courier, the old-fashioned way, because Ill tell you what, no computer is safe, he said. I have a boy whos 10 years old, he can do anything with a computer. You want something to really go without detection, write it out and have it sent by courier. Trump also left open the possibility of meeting with Taiwans president if she visits the US after he is sworn in on 20 January. Well see, he said when pressed on whether he would meet Tsai Ing-wen if she were to be in the country at any point after he became president. Tsai will be in transit in Houston on 7 January and again will be in transit in San Francisco on 13 January. Beijing bristled when Trump, shortly after his 8 November victory, accepted a congratulatory telephone call from the Taiwanese leader and has warned against steps that would upset the one-China policy China and the US have maintained for decades. Talk of a stopover in the US by Tsai has further rattled Washington-Beijing relations. Trump spoke to reporters for four minutes before entering the new year party, where guests included Sylvester Stallone and the model Fabio and for which invites had been sold at prices reported to be up to $575. Aides rejected claims that the sale of tickets could constitute the sale of access to the president-elect and his family. Earlier in the day, after issuing a new year message via Twitter in which he sent love to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just dont know what to do, Trump ditched his press pool to play golf at one of his clubs. He was reported, by Politico, to have thrown a biographer off one of his courses on Friday. Trump has not held a formal press conference since July.','business'),(84,'In 1960, the Liverpool entrepreneur Allan Williams arranged for a fledgling group, the Beatles, to undertake a residency at a club in the red light district of Hamburg. It transformed the way they played and set them on a course that was to change popular music. Williams, who has died aged 86, later fell out with the band, leaving the field clear for the record store manager Brian Epstein to become their manager. Williams warned Epstein to have nothing to do with them. He became known as the man who gave the Beatles away, and he would recount his experiences in pubs, clubs and Beatle conventions and, indeed, to anyone who would listen. He was a superb raconteur, who undoubtedly embellished his tales, but never out of self-interest  it was simply to make his remarkable tales even more entertaining. Williams was born into a Welsh family in the Liverpool suburb of Bootle. His father, Dick, was a joiner who also promoted concerts. When Allan was still young, his mother, Annie (nee Cheetham), died giving birth to twins, who also died, and it was some years before Allan learned that the person he called his mother, Millie (nee Twigg), was actually his stepmother. On leaving school, he worked as a plumber, and in his spare time sang as a tenor with the Bentley Amateur Operatic Society, where he met Beryl Chang, a domestic science teacher, in 1953. They married two years later despite encountering hostility from both their families to a mixed-race marriage. Keen to follow the London trend for teenage coffee bars, Williams opened the Jacaranda in Liverpool in September 1958. Some students at the nearby art college, including Stuart Sutcliffe, were asked to paint the toilets and provide a mural for the cellar. Sutcliffe was then a guitarist with the Beatles, and the band made early appearances at the Jacaranda. When Eddie Cochran and Gene Vincent played the Liverpool Empire in March 1960, their British manager, Larry Parnes, agreed to organise a one-off concert at Liverpool Stadium with Williams that May. Cochran was killed in a road crash in April, so Williams added local groups to the bill, but not the Beatles. He did not consider them good enough. After the concert, Parnes asked Williams to organise an audition for potential backing groups for his artists. As a result, the Beatles went to Scotland for a week to back the singer Johnny Gentle. As they had no drummer at the time, Williams found them a stand-in, Tommy Moore. Moore hated John Lennons sarcasm, however, and on returning to Liverpool decided to stay with his job at Garston Bottle Works. Williams had a share in the New Cabaret Artists club, a strip joint in Liverpool, and booked the Beatles to accompany a Manchester stripper for a week. When he sold the venue, he and his partner, a calypso singer called Lord Woodbine (Harold Phillips), went to Amsterdam and then Hamburg to assess the club life. At the Indra in Hamburg, Williams heard a German band attempting rocknroll and told the clubs owner, Bruno Koschmider, that he could supply Liverpool bands to do a better job. He recommended the Beatles, not because they were good but because they were available  they did not have day jobs. A few weeks later, Williams was with another Liverpool group, the Seniors, at the 2is coffee bar in London and found Koschmider there, looking for the Peetles. As a result, the first Liverpool band to play in Hamburg was the Seniors, with the vocalists Derry Wilkie and Freddie Fowell (later better known as Freddie Starr). Koschmider wanted more. Howie Casey, the Seniors saxophonist, told Williams not to send that bum group, the Beatles because of their inexperience. Williams and Beryl drove the Beatles to Hamburg. The band did well but fell out first with Koschmider, when they moved to a rival club, the Top Ten, and then with Williams, over commission on subsequent appearances. Williams felt he was still entitled to 10%, but they thought otherwise, and they parted company. In 1960, Williams opened the first beat club in Liverpool city centre, also called the Top Ten. It burned down within a week, but his late-night cabaret venue, the Blue Angel, thrived and in 1963, he promoted a beat festival at the Stanley Stadium, one of the earliest open-air rock concerts in the UK, perhaps the first. He admitted he had wasted his big chance, though. He watched the Beatles on the Royal Variety Performance in November 1963: Thats when I knew Id blown it. I threw a cushion at the TV  I wish Id had a brick. In 1975 Williams wrote his autobiography, The Man Who Gave the Beatles Away, with the journalist Bill Marshall. When he told Marshall that he could not remember any more anecdotes, Marshall invented some for his approval and Williams was soon telling them as his own. After a series of personal appearances to promote his book, in 1977 Williams, in partnership with the disc-jockey from the Cavern Club in Liverpool, Bob Wooler, organised the first Beatles convention. It promised an appearance by a Beatle. The tension mounted as the audience wondered who it would be. It turned out to be Moore. To make matters worse, Moore could remember little about his time with the Beatles. Williams himself appeared at many conventions around the world, and sold antiques and memorabilia at flea markets. He was always cheerful but he drank too much and Beryl told him to leave. He got together with Woolers former wife, Beryl, and he would refer to them as Beryl 1 and Beryl 2. Beryl 2 died in 2003. In 2002 a play based on Williamss experiences, The Man Who Gave the Beatles Away, written and directed by Ronan Wilmot, was premiered in Dublin. A second volume of his memoirs, The Fool on the Hill, this time written with Lew Baxter, was launched at the Beatles festival in Liverpool in 2003. Over the years, Williams had been vituperative about his relationship with the Beatles, but, in order to promote the book and prompted by Baxter, he became a changed man. He told audiences: I am a millionaire. I am a millionaire of memories and no one can take that from me. He is survived by his wife, Beryl, and his son, Justin, and daughter, Leah.  Allan Richard Williams, entrepreneur, born 21 February 1930; died 30 December 2016','entertainment'),(85,'Tesco has reduced the price of womens standard razors to match that of mens in the latest victory in the battle to eliminate gender discrimination in high street products. A newspaper investigation at the start of last year showed that women were paying an average of 37% more for gender-targeted items, ranging from toys to beauty products. Razors were found to be among the more marked-up products, with women often paying a premium just because the product was a different colour  pink. Tesco was charging 1 for a pack of five womens twin-blade razors, twice the price of the mens equivalent. The Labour backbencher Paula Sherriff, who recently persuaded Boots to trial donation boxes where customers could leave sanitary products for distribution to food banks, put pressure on Tesco to reduce womens disposable razor prices. In a letter to Sherriff, which has been passed to the Guardian, Tescos commercial director for packaged products, Kari Daniels, said the supermarket had reviewed its products to make sure it was not guilty of gender-differentiated pricing following a parliamentary debate. Daniels said the disparity in price was not the result of gender bias, but added: In the instance of our twin-blade razors, the difference is driven by the fact that male razors are produced and sold in significantly higher volumes, which reduces the price we pay for them. However, following an internal review and discussions with our suppliers, we have acted on concerns about the difference in price of our female and male disposable twin-blade razors, in line with our commitment to ensure consistently low, simple and affordable pricing. We have aligned the prices of these products so that the male and female razors are the same price per unit. We have done this by reducing the cost of the womens razors and keeping the cost of the mens razors the same. Both sets of razors now cost 10p per unit. Daniels also insisted that Tesco had changed its pricing strategy so it was moving away from large, short-term promotions to focus on prices that are consistently low and affordable, and simpler to understand. Sherriffs most significant parliamentary triumph since entering the House of Commons last year was forcing the government to confront the EU over the 5% VAT it makes countries impose on sanitary products. Ministers climbed down over the issue after Sherriff secured significant Eurosceptic Conservative support to demand that VAT be scrapped as part of any EU membership renegotiation package before the referendum on 23 June 2016. The former NHS worker, who also convinced WH Smith to reduce the cost of products in hospital shops to be in line with its high street prices, said: This is a welcome step from Tesco, and I hope other companies will identify and correct similar disparities. The government has refused to act on gender pricing so we have had to take a lead. Id encourage anyone who sees examples to get in touch and Ill take it up. Although gender-based pricing became a major issue in 2016, there had been concerns about the practice for several years. A 2012 study by Development Economics for insurer Aviva found that women were paying 200 extra a year for what were basically the same consumer goods and services.','business'),(86,'The president of the European commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, spent years in his previous role as Luxembourgs prime minister secretly blocking EU efforts to tackle tax avoidance by multinational corporations, leaked documents reveal. Years worth of confidential German diplomatic cables provide a candid account of Luxembourgs obstructive manoeuvres inside one of Brussels most secretive committees. The code of conduct group on business taxation was set up almost 19 years ago to prevent member states from being played off against one another by increasingly powerful multinational businesses, eager to shift profits across borders and avoid tax. Little has been known until now about the workings of the committee, which has been meeting since 1998, after member states agreed a code of conduct on tax policies and pledged not to engage in harmful competition with one another. However, the leaked cables reveal how a small handful of countries have used their seats on the committee to frustrate concerted EU action and protect their own tax regimes. Efforts by a majority of member states to curb aggressive tax planning and to rein in predatory tax policies were regularly delayed, diluted or derailed by the actions of a few of the EUs smallest members, frequently led by Luxembourg. The leaked papers, shared with the Guardian and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists by the German radio group NDR, are highly embarrassing for Juncker, who served as Luxembourgs prime minister from 1995 until the end of 2013. During that period he also acted as finance and treasury minister, taking a close interest in tax policy. Despite having a population of just 560,000, Luxembourg was able to resist widely supported EU tax reforms, its dissenting voice often backed only by that of the Netherlands. Among proposals popular in the code of conduct committee but opposed by Luxembourg were:  Plans for tax authorities in each member state to subject their dealings with multinational businesses to peer review.  An investigation into cross-border tax avoidance strategies, known as hybrid mismatches, often used by multinationals to conjure up artificial tax savings.  Improved information sharing between member states on tax deals granted to multinationals in private. A spokesperson for Luxembourgs finance ministry refused to comment on the positions previous governments had taken in private EU discussions. We have no knowledge of the communications you claim to have, and whether they are genuine, and therefore cannot comment on them, he said. The spokesperson added: In recent years Luxembourg has been at the forefront of the global trend towards greater transparency in tax matters and the fight against harmful tax competition. The Guardian spoke to another former member of the code of conduct committee, who did not want to be named but corroborated claims in the leaked cables that Luxembourg was regularly among those looking to frustrate EU efforts to tackle tax avoidance. The source said the committee was no longer fit for purpose. They said it was unable to achieve much because it was governed by unanimity. Each country is ready to block any agreement. Moreover, each country stands ready to bargain its position on tax against any other topic at stake in the EU, they said. Some tax experts contacted by the Guardian confirmed that Luxembourg had begun to move away from certain aggressive tax policies under the current prime minister, Xavier Bettel. However, the leaked cables suggest the country has remained resistant to other changes. In 2016 it fiercely opposed efforts supported by many countries to strengthen and expand the code of conduct committees work. Luxembourg particularly objected to a relaxation of the committees own rules on decision making, insisting there was no need to abandon the unanimity requirement. France, Germany and Sweden argued unsuccessfully that removing unanimity had become essential to the committees effectiveness. Luxembourg also opposed plans to identify member states that were standing in the way of reforms more clearly. One leaked cable noted: It has become abundantly clear once again that a majority [of members states] are not interested in real reform. In particular, Luxembourg representatives said they would fundamentally object to any proposal to publish arguments made by Luxembourg in the committee. A later cable read: It is impressive to see how some member states present themselves outwardly as proponents of [international tax reforms] and at the same time to watch how they actually behave in EU discussions, protected by confidentiality. The Guardian contacted Junckers office for comment. A spokesperson said it was not for the European commission to respond to questions about negotiating positions Luxembourg had taken, or about the countrys past tax policies. Damaging revelations Jean-Claude Junckers record as Luxembourgs prime minister has cast an enduring shadow over his presidency of the European commission. On paper, his marathon 18-year stint at the helm of the EUs second smallest member state might be hailed a triumph. He recast the fading steel-based economy into a booming hub for international business, and when he departed in 2013 Luxembourg had been transformed into one of the richest countries in the world per capita. Hundreds of the multinational corporations rushed to channel international profits through subsidiaries in the country, among them McDonalds, Fiat, Amazon, Shire Pharmaceuticals and Skype. The secret to this success was exposed in 2014 when the Luxleaks scandal revealed the terms hidden within hundreds of private deals, known as tax rulings, that Luxembourg had handed out to multinational businesses behind closed doors. The rulings effectively rubber-stamped complex tax structures that global corporations used to access ultra-low tax rates, often less than 1%, for profits shifted to Luxembourg. Juncker conceded the scandal had damaged his reputation. While not illegal, he admitted Luxembourgs tax system was also not always in line with fiscal fairness and may have breached ethical and moral standards. Since then, Juncker has made a point of supporting the EUs competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, as she pursues high-profile investigations into specific tax rulings, including deals Luxembourg granted separately to McDonalds and Amazon. The investigations are examining whether the deals were so generous that they amounted to illegal state aid from Junckers Luxembourg. Juncker has also campaigned hard for greater tax cooperation among member states in the battle against international businesses that avoid tax. The latest leaked cables, however, raise further questions about whether he is the right person to champion such reforms.','business'),(87,'2016 taught us that very little is predictable. But there are a few people worth watching next year, in the likely chance that theyll have a major role in shaping 2017. Here are the people to keep your eye on, in politics, the arts, media, and sports. Keith Ellison Ellison is one of the new hopes for the Democratic party  or at least for its progressive wing. A former community organizer who serves as a congressman for Minnesota, Ellison has been backed by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren to be the next chair of the Democratic National Committee. Although one of only two Muslims in Congress, Ellison has pledged to resign his seat in Congress if elected as DNC chair. As party chair he would attempt to hew the Democratic party to the left, focusing on grassroots organizing to build the party from the bottom up. He would work towards Sanders-esque proposals on taxing the wealthy and corporations, and on immigration reform, in the hope of tempting back Democratic voters in the 2018 mid-term elections. The DNC will meet over the weekend of February 24-26 to vote for their choice. Ellison is not a shoo-in, however; other names mentioned for the chair include Labor secretary Tom Perez, seen as a more moderate choice, and South Carolina Democratic party chairman Jaime Harrison. Steve Bannon The former executive chairman of unofficial Trump fan club Breitbart News will spend 2017 firmly embedded in the White House and is one of the few people who has the ear of the president-elect. Bannon  who is currently being portrayed as the grim reaper on Saturday Night Live  will serve as Trumps chief strategist and senior counselor, which is a made-up position but one likely to give him significant power. During the presidential campaign Bannon was said to be the one advisor who could talk forcefully to Trump  a rare position and one that means he may be able to hold Trump to some of the right-wing, populist promises that won him the election. Megyn Kelly Trumps antagoniser-in-chief ended 2016 by releasing a book, Settle for More, for which she was paid up to $10m, and she is likely to have an even more lucrative 2017. Her contract with Fox News expires in July, and she has reportedly been offered $20m a year to stay. Kelly is also apparently being pursued by ABC, NBC and CNN, although they might not offer her quite as much money. Fox News is one of the few broadcasters, newspapers and news websites that Donald Trump does not actively criticize, so the right-wing channel is likely to be his first port of call for interviews. That means that Kelly  despite not being Trumps favourite Fox News journalist (see: the Republican primary debates)  would have a rare opportunity to hold the president to account. If she decides to stay. Kamala Harris Californias senator-elect hasnt taken office yet, but she is already being touted as a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2020. Harris, whose mother is Indian American and father is Jamaican, is the first Indian woman and second black woman to be elected to the Senate. She will serve on the homeland security and governmental affairs committee and the select committee on intelligence, which could provide important checks on Donald Trump. Seen as a progressive, Harris was endorsed by the outgoing senator for California, Barbara Boxer, and Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren in her Senate run. She hasnt commented on the presidential speculation. But Barack Obama was another Democrat who endorsed Harris in 2016  and running for president as a first term senator seemed to work out for him. Dallas Cowboys The Dallas Cowboys have only lost two games so far and have looked to be one of the better teams in the NFL all season. Theyve been propelled towards that record by two rookies: the quarterback, Dak Prescott, and running back, Ezekiel Elliott. Prescott, 23, was only the 135th pick in the draft, and few would have expected him to get much game time. But after the Cowboys veteran quarterback Tony Romo broke a vertebrae in pre-season Prescott became first choice, and promptly broke Tom Bradys record for most consecutive passes thrown without an interception at the beginning of a career. His performances throughout the season have left some NFL commentators wondering if he might be the best rookie quarterback of all time. Meanwhile Elliot, 21, broke the Cowboys 39-year-old rookie record for rushing yards this season and has a chance to become the most successful rookie running back in NFL history. If Prescott and Elliott can keep up their form in the playoffs then the Cowboys could win their first Super Bowl since 1995. Elaine Welteroth This year was huge for Elaine Welteroth, who in May was appointed editor-in-chief of Teen Vogue at just 29. That made her the youngest Cond Nast editor-in-chief in history, and only the second African American to hold such a job. Immediately, Welteroth, along with digital editorial director Phillip Pacardi, upped the magazines political and social issues coverage, focusing on the election, LGBT, race and feminist issues. Teen Vogue had more females of color as cover stars than any other fashion magazine this year. And Welteroth has been the face of it all, regularly appearing on panels, in interviews or even as herself on the show Black-ish. Over 77,000 people follow her jet-setting life on Instagram. After publishing around a dozen stories a day in 2015, her team now publishes 50 to 70 daily. But Welteroth will face the challenges of a tough media business in 2017. Last month Cond Nast announced the magazine is getting cut back from a monthly to a quarterly, starting in Spring 2017, with a more collectible print edition and a digital focus. Issa Rae Actress, writer and producer Issa Rae created Insecure, one of 2016s most praised TV shows. Insecure began airing on HBO in October, putting black women and black female friendships front and center, and mixing microaggressions from working in an all-white work place with conversational Drake lyrics. The show has other big names on board: Larry Wilmore is an executive producer, Solange is a music consultant, Melina Matsoukas (director of Beyonces Formation) is a director and executive producer. Rae, 31, first shot to fame as a YouTube star, with her 2011 web series Misadventures of an Awkward Black Girl. Her production company, which also includes ColorCreative.TV, offers opportunities specifically for women and minority writers. In 2017, shes up for a Golden Globe for best actress in a comedy, will be writing and shooting season two of Insecure, and will serve as executive producer on a new comedy show by her production company called Minimum Wage, the story of five employees at a fast food restaurant in LAs Koreatown. Lorde Its been a couple of quiet years for the New Zealander who landed a US number one hit in 2013 when she was just 16 with Royals. Lorde (real name Ella Yelich-OConnor) won a stack of awards, including two Grammys and became part of Taylor Swifts squad, but has released no new music since 2014. Now shes 20 and is just finishing off her sophomore album. The party is about to start. I am about to show you the new world, wrote Lorde on Facebook about the new album, explaining that was all about her growing up and learning how to be an adult. Jack Antonoff of Bleachers fame is helping produce it. This month Antonoff and Lorde sung a cover of Robyns Hang with Me for a Christmas fundraiser for the LGBT charity The Ally Coalition, in New York, a reminder of Lordes strong, ethereal pipes.

Now starts, well: the worst worst year. Those of us appalled and terrified by the election of Donald Trump and the open rise of white supremacy in America ended 2016 exhausted and disillusioned. Now we enter 2017 in full knowledge that this year will probably be no better. No matter how much wed like to hide in our homes for the next four years, we know that we cannot do that. We must fight for equality and justice. But the question is: how? What action can we take in the aftermath of such a heartbreaking defeat? As we start this new year, here are some resolutions for resistance. Check your sources Yes, we are really living in a dystopian future where we cant be sure of what is true and what isnt. A sensational story cross your eye? Yes, it may well be accurate. But it could also be made up by a teenager in a basement in Milwaukee, because we apparently live in a horrible world these days. Check the links on all articles to verify that those links actually back up what the original article is saying with source material. No links? Try to find a more reliable source to back up the story. No luck? Then do not share that story. Write down the name of that publication and avoid them in the future. Check the about us page of unfamiliar sites: is there actual staff? A lot of fake news sites will try to avoid criticism by calling themselves satire (note: the Onion is satire; fake news sites are really trying to trick you). Other red flags: website names that are close but not quite the same as established and reputable news sites, lack of dates on articles, lack of author name on articles, anonymous sources that cant be verified (ex: a friend said, someone at the scene said, our sources say). Diversify your news The internet gives us a plethora of potential news sources. But we can still find ourselves consuming a dozen versions of the exact same viewpoint and convincing ourselves that we are well-informed. When I was an undergrad political science student, I had an international relations professor who not only required that we read three separate and very different papers each day, but that we read the local, national, international and economic sections of each. Then she would discuss a topic that had appeared in the papers and would test our ability to separate facts from the multiple interpretations given across the papers. This exercise taught me how widely the truth can be shaped and stretched, and how there can indeed be multiple truths for very important issues, depending on viewpoint. Its a lesson I try not to forget. Try to diversify not only the subject matter you read, but the ideology of the publishers and the identities of the writers. Put your money where your mouth is Make this the year that your money does the talking. Upset about the housing crisis in your area? Donate to a shelter. Believe in abortion rights? Donate to Planned Parenthood. Believe in small business? Shop local. Believe in equal opportunity? Support minority-owned businesses. And dont put your money into the businesses and banks that profit off the oppression of others or the destruction of the environment. Pay attention to local politics Guess what? There will be an election in 2017, and in 2018, and, well  you get the point. Local elections are where your vote counts the most and local votes are some of the most important votes you can make. What happens in your town can affect what happens in your county, then your state, your region and, ultimately, in the nation. School levies, minimum wages, city council elections  these votes have a real and almost immediate impact on your life and the lives of your community. Dont give that power away. Stay informed about what is happening locally. And vote. Decentralize whiteness Just about every aspect of western culture centralizes whiteness. Our history, infrastructure, medical system, justice system, education system, entertainment industry  and yes, our social justice organizations  all do this. Whiteness is default, its ubiquitous and its insidious. We dont have to purposefully center whiteness. When we neglect to decentralize it, it will be automatically centered. So work to decentralize whiteness: in your childrens school lessons, in your PTA meetings, in your office meetings, in your city council meetings, in the film and TV you watch, in the music you listen to, in the leaders you support. If you do not decentralize whiteness in your movements for progress, you will leave people of color behind. And what kind of progress is that? Understand your privilege Just about all of us have some privilege, and it is very important for us to be aware and to be willing to name that privilege. Your privilege is where you have the most power. Your privilege is the little piece of an oppressive system that you own and can therefore change. For example, I am not disabled  this is a major area of privilege for me. Im very glad that I know this, because, when I am asked to speak on diversity panels, I can ask if there will also be disabled speakers, ramps and sign language interpreters. My privilege means that Im asked to speak at more panels than disabled people are. My voice is in the room while disabled voices are not: being aware of that keeps me aware of my power to help change that. If I refused to recognize that privilege (and there was a time where I would have let guilt or just fear of confrontation keep me from doing so) I would simply remain a part of an oppressive system, even while claiming to work for liberation. Remember what youre fighting for It is very easy to become hyper-focused on what were fighting against  neo-Nazis, Islamophobia, racism, sexism. But nothing is a better and more important motivator than what we are fighting for. We are fighting for our communities, for our families, for our future. What keeps you in the battle? Keep that close to your heart and let it be the light that guides your way.','politics'),(89,'New Year: a time for resolutions, detox diets and predictions. But after the year forecasters had in 2016, who would be brazen enough to predict how 2017 will pan out? Where most economists went wrong last year  including the likes of the Bank of England and International Monetary Fund  was in predicting a sharp slowdown in the event of a vote for Brexit. George Osborne, for example, made the misjudged warning that a vote to leave the EU was a vote for recession. The early data could be revised, but it suggests that far from grinding to a halt, the economy continued to grow in the months following the referendum. Consumers kept spending, house prices rose and businesses continued to win new contracts at home and abroad. There are plenty of signs the economic pain has been delayed rather than averted. Inflation is picking up as a weak pound raises import costs. Cracks are showing in the jobs market and wages will soon struggle to keep pace with inflation. Business and consumer confidence have waned. And Brexit negotiations havent even begun. There are other threats beyond Brexit. Elections in the eurozone may bring turmoil to the bloc if support rises for anti-establishment nationalists. In the US, Donald Trump moves into the White House in less than three weeks and there is a risk he may start a trade war with China that could have global consequences. Yet there are still reasons to hope that 2017, like 2016, will not turn out as bad as the doomsayers predict. Surely, one lesson from last year is that when forecasters accentuate the negative they risk missing the positives altogether. So to start the new year on an upbeat note, here are a few reasons to be cheerful in 2017. The economy will keep growing The UK economy remains unbalanced, with an over-reliance on consumer spending, but it chalked up respectable growth in 2016. Expansion will most likely slow in 2017, but the UK should avoid recession. The services sectors fortunes will depend largely on how hard inflation hits consumer spending. Manufacturing and construction face a tough year as uncertainty and higher costs bite. But tourism and exports should be helped by a weak pound and there has been no exodus of foreign firms from Britain yet. Productivity is back in the spotlight After years of the UK lagging other big economies on productivity, ministers have vowed to sort out economic efficiency and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, announced a 23bn productivity fund in his autumn statement. It will not go very far but it is a start. The government push could be complemented by the private sector if the adversity and higher costs sparked by the Brexit vote force firms to improve their productivity. With a slowdown in immigration and a rise in the minimum wage coming, employers will need to look beyond cheap labour to maintain their profit margins. Ideally, that means investing more in good management, training and technology. Wages for the lowest paid will rise Inflation will squeeze average take-home pay in 2017, but for the lowest paid there is some good news as the national living wage  the minimum wage for over-25s  will rise in April from 7.20 to 7.50 an hour. That is still below what anti-poverty campaigners say should be the real living wage needed to meet everyday costs. The voluntary living wage is 9.75 in London and 8.45 elsewhere as set by the Living Wage Foundation. It reckons a fifth of UK workers are still not paid enough. But the good news is 3,000 employers have joined the voluntary scheme, including almost a third of the FTSE 100. Gender pay gap rules come into force There is still a 9.4% gap in average pay between male and female full-time employees. But companies will come under pressure to address the discrepancies when new rules come into force in April requiring large employers to report their gender pay and gender bonus gaps. More funding for apprenticeships Another change for employers this year is the apprenticeship levy, a tax on businesses designed to fund more work-based training schemes. It is high time young people in the UK are given more routes into decent careers and expanding apprenticeships could help tackle skills shortages in sectors such as construction. But employer groups have voiced legitimate concerns that the government risks going after quantity and not quality with its target of 3m apprenticeships by 2020. There are warnings the levy may prompt unscrupulous employers to rebadge existing jobs as apprenticeships to meet training targets and recoup the costs of the charge. Faint hopes for first-time buyers There was no house price crash after the referendum, but growth eased, dampened by Brexit-related uncertainty and stamp duty changes. The market is expected to slow further in 2017 and some forecasters predict prices could fall. That outlook will bring homeowners out in cold sweats but for anyone who has been trying to get on the housing ladder, a moderation in prices is long overdue. There is also a slither of hope that a government drive to address the UKs housing shortage could help first-time buyers. Still, given past experience of unfulfilled housebuilding promises, they should not hold their breath, and the uncertain economic outlook may make builders nervous about taking on big projects. The weak pound will help exporters There is little sign of it yet, but in theory the weak pound should help UK exports by making them cheaper in overseas markets. If the government wants UK businesses to capitalise on the drop in sterling it will need to give them more support to crack new markets such as one-to-one mentoring and funding to attend trade fairs. Interest rates will stay low The Bank of England faces a trade-off between supporting growth and jobs on the one hand and keeping inflation in check on the other. The Bank has said there are limits to how far it will tolerate rising inflation but most of the signals suggest that under Mark Carney it is more worried about jobs. So it is bad news if you are saver, but for businesses and mortgage holders, 2017 will see continued support from rates staying at, or close to, their all-time low of 0.25%. Calls for government help will grow louder The Bank stepped in with a package of post-referendum support for the economy, but the government has been more hands off. Carney and other central bankers around the world have repeatedly urged politicians to do their share of the heavy lifting to bolster their economies with spending on infrastructure and structural reforms. If Hammonds maiden autumn statement was anything to go by, he is not ready to pick up the baton. Far from abandoning Osbornes austerity drive, the new chancellor merely pared it back and he remains fixated on cutting the deficit. Yet, there are growing signs that voters here and abroad are fed up with the status quo and as inflation starts to erode UK living standards, Theresa Mays government will come under more pressure to deliver her promise of an economy that works for everyone. She and her cabinet will ignore peoples frustrations at their peril.','business'),(90,'The open-air dancefloors, bars and dining terraces of the Reina nightclub in Istanbul have for more than a decade played host to scenes of undiluted glitz. Open since 2002, the venue on the banks of the Bosphorus has earned a reputation as the place to be seen among Turkeys young, secular elite who recline on its white banquettes and are served ice buckets of drinks by aproned waiters. It attracts footballers from the top Turkish sides and stars from the countrys popular soap operas, as well as tourists and businesspeople from around the world. Daniel Craig, Kylie Minogue, Naomi Watts and Jon Bon Jovi are among the celebrities named as having been guests at the club, according to GC Prive, a London wealth management company that recommends the venue to its clients. The New Years Eve terrorist attack on the waterside club was not entirely unexpected. The clubs owner, Istanbul businessman Mehmet Koarslan, told the Hurriyet newspaper that the US had passed on intelligence over the risk of an attack and security had been stepped up including from the sea. The club is regularly praised in travel guides as the citys best. In 2011 the Guardian described it as where Istanbuls investment bankers dance the night away on the banks of the Bosphorus  the super-flash avoid the traffic of the coastal road and arrive at the club by boat. Its two floors are large enough to include Istanbuls priciest  and, some say, best  restaurant. According to the Worlds Best Bars website, it is packed with Turkish celebs, models, millionaires and media players and the restaurants run the gamut from Italian to sushi to more traditional local fare. It is positioned close to the Boazii bridge, which last summer was renamed 15 July Martyrs Bridge after the civilians who died in last years failed coup, including some who perished on the bridge. Tourists report that it is not always easy to gain entrance to the club, even if you are ready to pay the regular 18 entrance fee at weekends, as door staff can be selective.','business'),(91,'Its been a strange, unsettling year in the art market and 2017 looks likely to be just as turbulent. What does a new president who can rattle the world with a tweet mean for an industry so dependent on the international rich? The answer is that no one knows, but it is a hot topic among gallery owners and auctioneers this new year. In 2016, the art market received what it had purportedly wished for  some of the speculative froth came off the top of the market, easing fears that a bubble would burst and hurt the industry. But it also received much of what it probably did not forecast or desire: a 30% drop in overall market volume, a series of high-profile disputes, court actions and authenticity issues that resulted in substantial payouts, and a fall-off in attendance at some art fairs that read to some as cultural cooling-off at the bling end of the contemporary art business. The two major auction houses, privately held Christies and publicly listed Sothebys, have also undergone substantial changes to their business models whose reverberations are still being assessed. A dwindling supply of top-quality work, costly seller-guarantee systems and the overheads required to secure lots for sale have proved unsustainable. Both houses saw drops in business, with Sothebys down from $6bn in 2015 to roughly $4.1bn in 2016. The art market went down primarily because a small number of high-value objects did not trade hands as they had in 2015 and that reduced the overall market volume, says Art Market Monitors Marion Maneker. Still, both Sothebys and Christies auction houses instigated shakeups of their tradition-bound methods of business. Christies contemporary art chief, Brett Gorvy, quit after 23 years at the auction house to join Dominique Lvys gallery, which represents Frank Stella and the estate of Yves Klein among others. Sothebys too lost several longstanding department executives and announced plans to start offering management services to living artists as well as artists estates. That development has galleries rattled. Managing artists has traditionally been a gallerys job  not something done by secondary market auction houses. For an auction house to represent a living artist is like MGM representing Fred Astaire  you cant tie up all the sides of a transaction, Pace Gallerys Arne Glimcher told the Wall Street Journal. At the same time, many of the younger artists whose work had been driven up in value over the past several years, saw their work unceremoniously dumped at auction, reflecting the speculative spirit in which it had been purchased. Collector Niels Kantor told Bloomberg News he paid $100,000 for an abstract canvas by Hugh Scott-Douglas. Two years later, in September, he sold it at Phillips for $30,000. Id rather take a loss, Kantor told the market data service. Its like a stock that crashed. Phillips estimated that half of the 204 lots in the same sale were below $10,000  an indicator that speculators were dumping work. Instead of new artists, art advisers indicate many collectors are now most interested in rediscovering historically important artists that have slipped past undervalued. Two high-profile forgeries made headlines in 2016, forcing the business to take steps to reassure customers. Jurors in the Knoedler Gallery fraud trial in New York, heard how more than a dozen abstract expressionist masters were forgeries, while forensic conservator James Martin concluded that an $8.4m Frans Hals painting sold to a US collector by Sothebys was fake. The auction house quickly moved to hire Martin to provide museum-quality expertise. But the big unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable, question, is how the new political environment could affect the market. The softness in the art market in 2016 could be seen in the low attendance at Art Basel in Miami Beach this year and mirrored in sales across most luxury market sectors, including real estate. Yet the November auction sales proved unexpectedly robust following Donald Trumps election. Sothebys CEO, Tad Smith, told CNBC that the result had helped boost optimism in the art market. I think theres been a fairly good feeling among the art collectors this week, Smith said in November. Theres just a lot of very wealthy people from all types of countries  and they have a lot of capital to deploy. Market observers have not been slow to note the similarities between Trumps approach to business and that of Andy Warhol, who set up his studio production and promotional publishing machine in ways that correspond to Trumps real estate and self-promotion machinery. Artnet noted explicit similarities between Trumps business philosophy outlined in The Art of the Deal and Warhols The Philosophy of Andy Warhol: Making money is art, and working is art and good business is the best art, Warhol said succinctly. Trump meanwhile offered this: I dont do it for the money. Ive got enough, much more than Ill even need. Deals are my art form. Other people paint beautifully on canvas or write wonderful poetry. I like making deals, preferably big deals. Thats how I get my kicks. Many members of the incoming administrations cabinet, including the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, are art collectors. The art market boomed during the Reagan administration and through most of George W Bushs tenure. Still, Maneker says its too soon to speculate on the art market under Trump. You can draw two diametrically opposed scenarios based on the same behavior. If Trump raises tariffs and causes global panic, art could then become exceedingly valuable because its portable, easy to store and not a currency. But it could also become worthless. Nobody knows the right answer. But as the year in art turns, at least there has been some good news for rocks elite in what has been in all other terms a dark year. In the weeks after September 11 2001, guitarist Eric Clapton acquired, in a single lot at Sothebys, three Gerhard Richter abstracts for $3.4m. He sold the last of the three, Abstraktes Bild (809-2), at Christies in November for $22.1m, bringing his total profit on all three works to $74.1m. There was another winner, too, from the rock world. Christies outgoing head Gorvy revealed last week, he had sold a Jean-Michel Basquiat boxer painting from Christies private selling exhibition via his Instagram feed. The buyer was an unnamed American collector who paid $24m sight unseen. The seller? Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich.','business'),(92,'Forget tequila and mezcal, Mexicos oldest alcoholic drink is pulque, made from the fermented sap of an agave plant. The Aztecs dubbed it drink of the gods and reserved it for priests and nobles. Ancient murals depict the milky liquid fuelling grisly ritual sacrifice. After the Spanish arrived in the 1500s, pulque became widely available and the first pulqueras opened. It was the working mans tipple and in the early 20th century there were more than 1,000 pulqueras in Mexico City. In its natural state, pulque can be slimy and sour-tasting, but it is rich in probiotics, vitamins and minerals. Devotees believe it can cure everything from digestive disorders to diabetes. By the 1950s, its popularity had plummeted, thanks in part to campaigns from beer and soft drinks companies. Now its in vogue once more, with old-school establishments being reinvented and neo-pulqueras popping up in the capital. One such venue is Pulquera Insurgentes in the citys Roma district, a four-storey bar-cum-cultural centre that pulses to an eclectic mix of music, from ranchera to heavy metal and jazz. Another bar in the Centro Histrico  Las Duelistas , founded in 1912  has been transformed. Pulque is still scooped out of wooden barrels, but psychedelic murals adorn the walls, and hipsters outnumber old-timers. The drink is made in the age-old way: sap from the heart of the plant fermented for a week or two, then mixed and muddled with all manner of fruits, vegetables and grains  perhaps guava, celery or oatmeal  in a curado. Its Mexican heritage in a glass, and last night pulqueras were celebrating New Years Eve once more. This article has been amended as the main image originally showed the making of tejate instead of pulque.','business'),(93,'The passage of a bathroom bill last March sparked a maelstrom with severe political, economic and cultural consequences for North Carolina that continued through the end of 2016. Yet Texas is poised to propose a similar law in 2017. In November, one of the states most senior politicians published his top 10 priorities for the next legislative session. A Womens Privacy Act was at number six, right after banning immigration sanctuary cities and insisting on photo ID at the ballot box. The act, said lieutenant governor Dan Patrick, is necessary so that women and girls can have privacy and safety in their restrooms, showers and locker rooms. When filed, the bill is likely to turn national attention to Texas in the wake of North Carolina legislators failure to repeal their bill during a special session on 21 December. Patrick issued a statement the following day congratulating them. The so-called bathroom bill in North Carolina includes a provision that requires people to use public bathrooms that match the gender on their birth certificate. Critics have described it as a thinly veiled attack on the transgender community under the guise of protecting public safety. Patrick hasnt released his own proposed bill, but has said it would allow businesses to create their own bathroom policies. Despite the demonstrable negative consequences in states that have passed laws that undermine LGBTQ equality, the coming months will indicate whether the ascent of Donald Trump to the White House is emboldening religious conservatives to press for more such bills after a series of gains for gay and transgender people at the federal level under the Obama administration. A federal court ruling Saturday may further embolden these efforts. A Texas judge temporarily halted Obama administration rules that are intended to ban discrimination by doctors and hospitals against transgender persons. Joining Texas in the suit were Wisconsin, Kentucky, Nebraska and Kansas. In August, the same judge sided with 13 Republican-controlled states to block transgender protections in public schools sought by the Obama administration. Something that should be avoided So-called religious freedom provisions similar to those that caused controversy in Indiana in 2015 are also set to be aired in the Texas statehouse next year. I certainly believe that logically thinking people would look to North Carolina and look to Indiana, said Chuck Smith, chief executive of Equality Texas, an LGBTQ advocacy group. Such people would see, he said, the economic consequences that were experienced in those states as a result of filing discriminatory legislation, and a logically thinking person would come to the conclusion that that is something that should be avoided in the state of Texas. The states chamber of commerce, the Texas Association of Business (TAB), reached that view. It has produced a 23-page report warning of dire economic consequences if the state follows North Carolinas path by pursuing a policy that would harm tourism, alienate employers and dissuade talented millennials from staying in or moving to Texas. If you just look at North Carolina and Indiana and put that over a Texas-sized footprint of our economy, it could be up to $8.5bn and 185,000 jobs lost, it is very dramatic, said Chris Wallace, the associations president. We want to remain one of the top states in which to do business, so why would we want to do anything to risk any of that, by legislation thats really unnecessary and unenforceable? The question of how you would enforce people going into the right bathroomWhat, so you have to take your birth certificate? It gets really tricky. Weve got too many core issues that we need to be worried about in this state  education, transportation, water, many more. Economic development, keeping us strong. We dont need these types of issues to overshadow our core agenda items. Att a Texas Tribune event in November, Joe Straus, the speaker of the Texas house of representatives, said he had other, more urgent concerns than the bathroom bill. Patrick, though, appears unmoved. In a statement earlier this month his office called the TAB report misinformation and fear-mongering regarding a bill they havent even seen. It also defended the proposal as a way to assure that sexual predators, like those who exploit the internet, will not be able to freely enter womens restrooms, locker rooms or showers, and that businesses are not forced by local ordinances to allow men in womens restrooms and locker rooms. Patricks spokesperson did not return a Guardian request for comment. We have a friend in the White House Sexual assault in any location is, of course, already illegal, while there is no evidence that non-discrimination laws have resulted in increased rates of sexual assault. By contrast, LGBTQ advocates argue that violence and bias against transgender people is a very real problem exacerbated by prejudicial laws. North Carolinas HB2 was signed into law by Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican who lost his bid for re-election in November. The backlash saw sports events and concerts cancelled and businesses scrapping investment plans. Patrick, 66, was a radio talkshow host perhaps best-known for getting an on-air vasectomy until he was elected as lieutenant governor in 2014 on a platform of stopping the invasion of undocumented immigrants. He was the Texas state chairman for the Trump presidential campaign. Starting in 2017, we will have a friend in the White House who was clearly elected because the people of this country believe in the conservative principles that have guided the way we govern in Texas, Patrick said in November. Smith, of Equality Texas, said that Texass conservative politicians telegraphed their intentions to introduce more anti-equality legislation long before Trumps victory. I believe we have seen a heightened sense of concern about the possibility of favourable policies being rolled back on a federal level, he said. At the state level we already saw the threats that were lying ahead and those havent really changed. The US supreme court legalised same-sex marriage nationwide in June 2015. That major victory for gay rights appears to have inspired a pushback by conservative Republicans in states. According to the Human Rights Campaign, more than 200 anti-LGBTQ bills were introduced across the country in 2016 sessions  most failing to pass  and more than 111 million people live in states without clear state-level protections against LGBTQ workplace discrimination. Smith is also concerned that 2017 will see Texas legislators press for religious freedom laws that would, for example, exempt Christian retailers who believe homosexuality is a sin from providing services for gay weddings. So far there are a handful of Texas bills which advocates consider anti-LGBTQ that have been filed amid the usual slew of pro-gun, pro-God, anti-undocumented immigrant, anti-abortion and anti-federal government proposals up for discussion when the legislative session starts in January. One would eliminate local non-discrimination ordinances if they have protections that go beyond state law  reminiscent of HB2. Another calls on the state not to enforce federal laws that the Texas legislature deems to violate the state constitution  which since 2005 has defined marriage as between a man and a woman. A high-profile revision of the law on a parents right to know information about their child has raised fears that it could force teachers to out students.','politics'),(94,'Roxane Gay describes the lives of more than 20 women in this collection of short stories.

Gays women are perpetually under threat. However, Gay never portrays them as weak. Each possesses a strength that enables them to escape, move on or distance themselves from difficult situations. The title of the collection carries the same sarcasm as when Gay describes her female subjects with well-worn stereotypes: crazy, loose, frigid, etc. The stories, phenomenally powerful and beautifully written, demonstrate the threats so many women in reality face, but also how, whatever their situation, they have agency, resilience and identities away from stereotypes created and reinforced by men. &nbsp;Difficult Women by Roxane Gay is published by Corsair (13.99).

Shes on her way to Greenwich, Connecticut, to hustle some money out of an estranged sister who married rich. Then the sister is arrested for fraud, and Mackenzie is stuck taking care of her kids. If this seems like something of a tired comedic premise, thats part of the appeal of The Mick: with so many other comedies this year eschewing straightforward laughs in favor of complicated stories about depression, its nice to have a show that wants to throw out some of the most disgusting jokes it can think of, all while gleefully endangering children. Not that star Kaitlin Olson is in any way a stranger to gross-out humor  as one of the stars of FXXs long-running series Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia, she has long had an outlet for her equal parts debauched and high-strung energy. In theory, Mackenzie should be judged absent comparisons to Olsons Sunny character Dee, but The Micks pedigree (from past Sunny writers) and the comedy it asks of Olson makes parallels inevitable. If The Mick proves anything, its that Olson is an extraordinarily talented comedian. Mickeys snotty nephews and niece arent Rob McElhenny, Glenn Howerton and Charlie Day but they do bring different, snivelling energy to the proceedings. Chip (Thomas Barbusca) is an angry, entitled kid who thinks he can sue his way into anything, while Sabrina (Sofia Black DElia) is a classic rich kid, more concerned with seeing her friends DJ in Soho than remembering siblings birthdays. The best thing about The Mick is that Mackenzie, barely inhibited by feelings of affection for her charges and coming from a background of laziness and debauchery herself, is willing to do all sorts of things no parent would ever do on TV, particularly with Sabrina. Mickey forces her into a drinking contest, tricks her into thinking shes pregnant as a way of teaching her about sex, and turns a birthday party for the youngest child, Ben (Jack Stanton) into a competitive parenting arena. Though Its Always Sunny is the obvious point of comparison, Sabrina and Mickeys barb-trading helps center The Micks thematic target: the ultra-wealthy. If you centrifuge out the Sunny elements, it seems awfully similar in its core concept to another Fox sitcom about a family of awful rich people dealing with fraud charges  A few episodes in, The Mick is more than a bit too soft to cut so deeply. Like nearly all sitcoms, The Mick looks like its going to be about the formation of a makeshift family  including Carla Jimenez as Alba, the Pembertons housekeeper and Mackenzies friend, and Scott MacArthur as Jimmy, her not-quite-boyfriend  rather than Arrested Developments focus on a family that really ought not to stay together. But The Micks warm emotional core might be a justified response to its central premise: having all of the hijinks supported by obscenely rich criminals who also just happen to be absent.

Powa Technologies, an e-commerce company that was one of Britains so-called unicorns (a startup valued at over $1bn), crashed hard, declaring bankruptcy early in 2016. US wearables company Pebble sold to Fitbit for less than a 10th of its peak valuation. But on the plus side, Europe minted  foaled?  10 new unicorns, and Finnish gaming company Supercell became the continents first decacorn (a startup valued at over $10bn). But for some startups, the year ahead is nothing but hopeful. Here are some of the companies that look set to have a 2017 they will remember for some time. Monzo Banking startup Monzo launched in 2015, but 2017 is set to be a turning point for the fintech darling. For the first 18 months of its public operation, Monzo has been limited in what it can offer customers by British banking regulations, forcing it to operate as little more than a pre-paid debit card with a (very slick) app. But early next year, Monzo should receive a full banking licence, allowing it to operate as the main bank account for users who want to switch their financial life over to a startup wholesale. Crucially, the license gives it access to the direct debit and faster payments system, allowing users to pay bills from their Monzo accounts  and be paid into their accounts. The banking licence also means the company can start making money for the first time. Users will be able to request an overdraft facility on their Monzo current accounts, with the fees paid being the first revenue the startup will pull in. In the long term, though, dont expect it to settle for overdraft fees: Monzo wants to be Facebook for money. Thread Fashion tech startup Thread is trying to solve the problem of styling at scale. Its a tricky beast: your style is an inherently personal thing, yet for any startup to avoid burning money, it needs to come up with a way to efficiently pick clothes for thousands of customers at the same time. Threads trick is a clever mixture of human stylists, AI assistants and tools that let both work together to deliver a semi-personalised collection of outfit ideas to every customer. It means that each human stylist is able to provide five outfits a week to somewhere in the realm of 80,000 people, with Threads sartorial suggestions improving the more data it has on each member. Despite its data-driven back end, though, the stylists fashion sense still shines through. Still to come: womenswear, which has been on the backburner owing to the vast increase in complexity for womens fashion. Automata Robotics startup Automata has its background in architecture: the companys founders spent 10 years working in Zaha Hadids studios. There, they learned the value of robots for simple repetitive tasks, but also the prohibitive cost of most of the machines available on the market today. The fruits of their labour will arrive in 2017: a low cost robotic arm, which the company hopes will give robotics its iPhone moment. It can be programmed by simply moving the arm, showing it the movements it needs to carry out. Those motion points are stored, and used to automate the task. The company has is set on automating low-skilled, repetitive manual labour. Rather than going for scale, however, its focusing on smaller companies that would love to automate their business but cant afford the capital costs. Open Whisper Systems Open Whisper Systems is never going to become a unicorn, or make its founders rich, but it could be the startup that has the most effect on the coming year. The non-profit group is in charge of the development of iPhone app Signal, an encrypted messaging service that has Edward Snowdens seal of approval. Where Signal differs from most secure chat apps is its ease-of-use: the app feels very similar to everyday services like WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger. In fact, WhatsApp also offers encryption, and borrowed the basic code wholesale from Signal. Thats fine, because Open Whisper Systems makes everything it does available under open-source licences, which allow others to reuse the code as they see fit. It also lets anyone with the technical knowhow examine the app to make sure it does what it says it does. Downloads of Signal spiked in the days after Donald Trumps election, as many realised that a far-right demagogue would soon be in charge of the worlds most advanced surveillance apparatus. Hopefully, that will prove to be an abundance of caution, but if not, the app could be a lifesaver. OnePlus Hardware is hard. Its not enough simply to code something and release it to the world. You need to actually build the stuff, too. So its extra impressive that Chinese startup OnePlus has managed to rise to be one of the best smartphone manufacturers in the world in just three years and five phones. And it 2017, it hopes to take third place in the global smartphone market, by units shipped, placing it square behind Samsung and Apple. Its a big goal, but the smartphone maker could pull it off. It chases the premium end of the budget market  or the budget end of the premium market  by making phones that compete favourably with the flagships such as Samsung and Google, but with price tags hundreds of pounds lower. CCP Icelandic games company CCP hardly counts as a startup. Founded in 1997, the company is best known for its first and flagship game, Eve Online, a space-faring massively multiplayer game, which has been running continuously for 13 years. Eve remains a huge business, and recently went free to play in an effort to entice more users to jump into the galaxy of New Eden, but CCPs big bet is in a different realm. Two Eve spinoffs, Valkyrie and Gunjack, have led the pack of virtual reality-based games. Gunjack, a turret shooter, is one of the more popular games on simple VR platforms like Googles Daydream. Eve Valkyrie, meanwhile, is a full-blown multiplayer space combat sim, throwing the player into chaotic dogfights around the rusting hulks of dead spaceships. Both games have been well-received, leading to interest from potential buyers mooting a 900m price-tag.','tech'),(97,'Mohamed Hassan Farah, a Somali in US federal prison, has little in common with the 19th-century seafarer Thomas Smith besides the fact that they are among the few people to be convicted of piracy on the high seas in a US court.

Farah is one of only 28 Somalis to be convicted of piracy in the US in recent years following a multinational crackdown after a spike in attacks and kidnappings. Besides costing the global commerce $18bn a year, Somali pirates have taken several lives  including four Americans traveling on a private yacht  and terrorized the people they kept hostage, as famously depicted in the film Captain Phillips. Speaking by phone from prison in Glenville, West Virginia, he tells the Guardian about the night in 2010 he and his five crew got into a gun battle with the US navy in the Gulf of Aden, an encounter in which he lost a leg and which ultimately culminated in his incarceration. He protests his innocence and, while the prosecution described him and his co-defendants as serious threats, Farah is still confused as to how he ended up in a cell in West Virginia. He claims his craft was returning from smuggling people from Somalia to Yemen when their ship broke down and left them stranded at sea for seven days without food or water. He said he had fallen asleep by the engine of the skiff when he was jolted by the sound of an AK-47. The gunshots were let off by a crewmate who had spotted a vessel in the distance and had hoped to attract help, Farah said. At the later trial a key question was whether the initial shot was in the air or at the ship. After he shot, we all woke up, and started screaming at each other, said Farah, who uses a wheelchair and communicates with people in the prison with sign language as he does not speak English. The crew quickly realized this was no ordinary vessel: it was the USS Ashland, an American navy ship. According to court testimony from the USS Ashland crew viewed by the Guardian and Farahs account, the navy responded by firing on the skiff with an MK-38, a machine gun that can tear through helicopters and armored vehicles. A bullet hit Farahs crewmate fatally in the chest and he watched the man fly overboard. Before he could jump in the water, another shot struck their tiny boat. It hit the engine, causing an explosion that set the whole boat ablaze. Farah said he went in and out of consciousness. His crewmates  now covered in burns  trod water and held him up. Unbeknown to him at the time, one of his legs had been blown off in the explosion. Eventually a navy reconnaissance team came out to round the men up. I was unconscious when we got on the [US navy] boat, he said, speaking to the Guardian via a translator. Afterwards, they said we were pirates who kidnap boats, that we were carrying weapons. After the gun incident, the navy brought the men to US shores to stand trial in Norfolk, Virginia. They were indicted for piracy on the high seas, a charge that carries life in federal prison; Farah and his crewmates denied the charges. Farahs arrest was the result of a new policy enacted a few years prior. Western countries had formed a naval coalition involving ships from at least 12 countries to patrol the Gulf of Aden as piracy spiraled out of control in 2008 and some countries decided to try captured seafarers suspected of piracy. This created a lottery of outcomes for Somalis in which America  with its tough justice system  was the least favorable destination. Regardless of his guilt or innocence, Farah might already be out of prison had he been caught by a Dutch or French ship. In some states they could not convict them because they didnt have the offense of piracy or only piracy committed on the high seas, said Anna Petrig, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Basel who has written on the detention of pirates. They could only be convicted of ordinary crimes and receive sentences of only five or six years. Somali piracy had been a problem since the turn of the century but it intensified in 2008, when the number of hostages taken from merchant and private ships jumped from 177 to 815 in just one year. Hijackings and attempted hijackings in the Gulf of Aden, a popular shipping route, increased five-fold that year, according to statistics from the International Maritime Bureau. The shipping industry began putting pressure on western governments to tackle the problem as it was jeopardizing a valuable trade route. A series of United Nations resolutions passed between 2008 and 2009, allowed foreign navies to patrol Somalias territorial waters for pirates. But these navy patrols arguably did not fully anticipate one thing: what to do with the pirates when they were caught? The confusion around this question led to nine out of 10 pirates being released after capture in the first few years of the patrols. Some countries agreed to take pirates who attacked their own interests for trial  the US was one of them. Farah and his co-defendants were among the first pirates the US brought back for trial. Today, the Somali pirates incarcerated in American prisons number at least 28, stemming from just five cases. Life sentence Farah told the Guardian he was born in a small village outside of the coastal city of Bosaso in Somalia, where his parents kept cattle or fished to get by. He and his 15 siblings  nine sisters and six brothers  did not get much in the way of an education growing up. Farah said he had taken only three years of Quranic school as a child. During his trial some 7,556 miles away from his village, he was up against the US district attorney of Eastern Virginia. The case, though, against the men proved to be extremely convoluted as the only law pertaining to piracy in the US was 200 years old. Bringing that law into the present day presented a range of hurdles. My very first thought, said attorney Christian Connell, who represented one of the men: How can they prosecute these guys right here? Thats just crazy to me. UN resolutions passed in the 1980s gave all nations jurisdiction over piracy on the high seas, and therefore the right to prosecute a pirate for crimes committed in international waters. Shortly after their arrival in the US, the six men were appointed lawyers and translators since none of them spoke English. The DA convinced Farahs co-defendant Jama Idle Ibrahim, represented by Connell, to cooperate with the government. Ibrahim had been identified as a participant in a previous piracy case and the state provided him with an ultimatum: either cooperate or face life sentences in both cases, his lawyer said. At the trial before a jury in February 2013, Ibrahim testified that the entire crew had embarked on this trip to loot ships. He had made $17,000 the year before after capturing a Danish ship but had run out of money and decided to set out again. According to transcripts of his court testimony, obtained by the Guardian, Ibrahim said that he assembled a crew of seven, in which he was the leader and Farah was the driver and responsible for the boats engine. The navy killed one and the remaining six were on trial in Norfolk. With little time after the five-day trial, the jury found the men guilty on all counts, including piracy. Ibrahims testimony proved damning. Farah was sentenced to 32 years in prison. The judge ruled that a life sentence was too severe despite them being found guilty of piracy. The government appealed to have the life sentence reinstated  and won. The supreme court subsequently declined to hear the case. Farah was brought back to Virginia to await his new sentence, but it remains unclear where he will serve his lifelong imprisonment. He has spent the past few years at the Gilmer federal correctional institution, a medium security prison with about 1,500 inmates in Glenville, West Virginia. Along with his amputated leg, Farah has suffered from other health issues in prison. I have problems with my stomach, he said from a prison phone. My intestines are not fine, and the doctors have said that I should do a surgery, but the government hasnt done anything to make that a reality. He said he often has trouble eating because of his stomach issues and is put on an intravenous drip for sustenance. However, Farah said that he does not mind life in jail. He has found solace in the prisons Muslim community. His cellmate is a Muslim from Washington DC. Even though they cant speak to one another, they get along. The imams at the prison mosque have assisted Farah with money for soap and phone credits. He managed to make an international call to his family once, but was restricted to the 15-minute time limit placed on prison calls. They told me they were all fine, he said. But what can someone whom you speak to for 15 minutes tell you? Farahs main concern in the interview was confusion surrounding his case. He said he was unsure of the status of his case during the earlier appeals. He has since acquired new counsel but having spent six years in prison, he has little hope for the future. We have no one to support us or deliver us from these problems, except for Allah.','politics'),(98,'We had come to Bleggio by car, traversing mountain roads to reach this remote area of the Dolomites directly north of Lake Garda. Driving from southern Trentino we headed down towards Riva, a tourist town on the northern shores of the lake, and then due north, gaining altitude as we zipped up a valley pass. Sheer peaks and dense forest penned us in the higher we went, until we reached a plateau of rolling hills and a herb-flecked meadow. It was to this protected alpine world that my grandmother, great aunt and two great uncles had fled as children in the final years of the second world war, living alone on a small farm while their parents were forced to remain in their occupied hometown of Ala. This was a journey made by many children at the time; when Italy declared itself an allied nation the country fell into civil war and fascist troops took hold of the north of the country. Bleggio was a safe haven far removed from the fighting. We had come  me, my mother, her partner and my girlfriend  to explore this place that had protected our extended family. The exact location of their hideout was a mystery due to the fact that my relations, Maria, Liliana, Desiderio and Franco, had existed here as sfollati, an Italian term for displaced people, meaning they had no official records attached to them. There were blurry childhood memories of a mountainside farmhouse and keeping chickens, but nothing concrete. In lieu of a precise location, we had plotted a walk across the valley from east to west ending on Cima Sera, a peak overlooking the entire region. Our base was Maso Pra Cavai, a guesthouse and family-run farm. We arrived late in the day but received a warm welcome from the owner, Rodolfo Brochetti, who served us delicious plates of a risotto made with cooking apples (half simmered with the rice, half added just before serving). The Brochetti farm, like many in the area, specialises in walnuts and Rodolfo ended the evening with walnut liqueur, pickled walnuts and a large walnut cake. We began walking early the next day from Stenico, a village perched on one of the highest points in the region, where the ruling prince-bishops had kept a castle from which to cast an eye out over their lands. Sticking my head out of an arched stone window I took in the rolling expanse below and found myself wondering where my family might have lived and what their life would have been like. As far as we were aware, the four siblings  the youngest was six and the eldest 14  were driven up the same pass we had taken into the valley and dropped off somewhere remote with a supply of grains, preserves and livestock. A local priest would have been paid some money to keep an eye on them but they were largely left to their own devices. They would have felt incredibly free and safe here but there would have been the anxiety of living away from their parents and all that was familiar to them, until the family were eventually reunited following the end of the war and Italian liberation. Further down the valley in Madice, strange rickety buildings were packed into rows on its sloping streets. Each home had a cave-like entrance and a large wooden hayloft on top, accessible only by a curving stone ramp. We stopped at the regional municipal office on the off-chance that they would have some information, but the administrators confirmed that they had no records of families staying during the war. Instead, they suggested that the best resource was local people, custodians of a wealth of oral history in this region that is far richer than any state archive. As we made our way through Bleggio, village after village, it was hard to avoid hunting for signs of my relatives, continually feeling as though I was about to discover some clue or proof of their existence here. A mile or so from the mountain I obsessed over a tiny chapel at the side of the road, its walls covered with graffitied names dating back to the war. I hoped naively to find the names of my family scrawled into the side  suppose they had lived nearby?  but there was no sign. After clambering up slanting beech forest and rocky scrub, we reached the peak of Cima Sera and sat down to watch the land unfolding beneath us. Far away was castle Stenico, now barely visible. From up here it was easier to accept that this trip was never going to throw up a miraculous find: there was no perfect alpine cottage waiting with a lit fire and a smiling portrait of my family. Yet just being in this region, knowing that our family were once kept secure somewhere in this hilly expanse, left us with a feeling of having discovered something significant about them, and getting a glimpse into their childhood. Leaving the mountain, we decided to return next year, to interview some of the older community. Beyond the draw of personal history, this region holds so many stories from an overlooked period of Italian history and it is important to listen to them before they disappear for ever.

The Treasury said the governments new powers would see individuals or corporations who take deliberate action to help others evade paying tax facing fines of up to 100% of the tax they helped evade or 3,000, whichever is highest. The new crackdown, first announced by the then chancellor George Osborne in the 2015 budget, will mean HMRC can, for the first time, penalise the facilitators of tax evasion who help to physically move funds abroad or advise on offshore tax saving. Announcing the new penalties, the financial secretary to the Treasury Jane Ellison said: Tax evasion is a crime and as a government we have led reform of the international tax system to root it out. Closer to home we are creating a tax system where taxes are fair, competitive and paid. The raft of measures we have introduced to tackle avoidance and evasion will create a level playing field for the vast majority of people and businesses who play fair and pay what is due. A new corporate criminal offence of failing to prevent the facilitation of tax evasion will also be introduced this year, with companies held liable if an individual acting on their behalf as an employee or contractor facilitates tax evasion. Previous rules meant a corporate criminal prosecution was only possible if there was proof that the board of directors were aware and involved in facilitating the evasion. The Treasury said HMRC had secured more than 2.5bn specifically from offshore tax evaders since 2010. However, the department was criticised last November after its new specialist tax evasion unit only successfully pursued one criminal prosecution, despite having identified potential evasion and avoidance worth nearly 2bn after examining the tax affairs of 6,500 super-rich individuals. Also coming into force on 1 January is a new requirement to correct past tax evasion, which will see anyone who has failed to correct past evaded taxes by 30 September 2018 hit with tough new penalties. The Treasury said more action was planned in the coming months, including a consultation on a new requirement for businesses and individuals who create complex offshore financial arrangements that bear the hallmarks of enabling tax evasion to notify them to HMRC. May pledged during her leadership campaign that she would pursue companies and individuals who took part in deliberate tax avoidance. It doesnt matter to me whether youre Amazon, Google or Starbucks: you have a duty to put something back, you have a debt to fellow citizens and you have a responsibility to pay your taxes, she said.','business'),(101,'Arsenal Based on his form against us, I certainly wouldnt kick Cavani out of bed, but the scarcity of genuine world-class goal poachers is evident in Man Utds willingness to speculate almost twice the price of Snchez on the unproven talents of Martial. Plenty of Gooners might be pleased to see no further spending, since presumably Arsenal will only loosen the purse strings if Wenger has committed to his own two-year extension  In an ideal world Id like to see Matuidi or Dortmunds Weigl in red and white, but Arsnes not about to concede that Xhaka was a 35m ricket. As a statement of the clubs intent, the most crucial signings are those of Snchez and zil on new contracts. Bernard Azulay goonersdiary.co.uk, @GoonerN5 Bournemouth There are three areas we need to look at. First, a solid, experienced keeper. Artur Boruc has played well but back strains are a problem, and Adam Federici doesnt fill the goal as much  so someone like Joe Hart would make a huge impact. Second, an attacking midfielder like Wilfried Zaha: a fast, creative talent who can change a game. And third, a striker with the energy of Divock Origi. Not much to ask? Peter Bell afcbchimes.blogspot.co.uk, @CherryChimes Burnley Well be focusing on squad strengthening as much as anything, but Id specifically like to see another central midfielder, and a wide player with a bit of pace. We were close to filling both those gaps at the end of August with Brightons Dale Stephens and Polish winger Kamil Grosicki from Rennes, but the deals fell through. Itd be no surprise to see Stephens back on the winter shopping list, though: hes out of contract in the summer  thatll put Brighton under pressure this month. Tony Scholes uptheclarets.com, @utcdotcom Chelsea As things stand, were looking great  but you do have to wonder how many injuries we are away from a serious problem. The defence is certainly vulnerable: we have two war-horses on the bench but theyd struggle to play in a three, so Conte has to look for more resources. Its a shame that Leonardo Bonucci signed a new Juventus deal. Elsewhere, and this may not be a popular view, but I also think we need to start a search to replace Victor Moses. Hes played better than most expected but he has his limitations. I also wonder whether well be searching for a striker as Batshuayi didnt get his chance despite Costa being suspended. Conte has stressed that his time will come, but will the youngster be willing to wait? And finally, as important as buying new options is retaining the talent we have  Cesc Fbregas specifically. Its difficult to buy that sort of quality these days. Trizia Fiorellino chelseasupportersgroup.net Crystal Palace We have all sorts of problems but a striker is probably the most urgent given Connor Wickhams long-term injury. As it stands, Fraizer Campbell is the only back-up to Benteke, which isnt a good place to be. The defence needs a proper overhaul too, with Pape Souar out injured and the rest of the backline having looked fairly clueless. At a minimum, by the end of January we need to have a new attacking left-back ready to go  Kieran Gibbs, Charlie Taylor or Neil Taylor? And it seems like Allardyce is also after a midfield enforcer, with the clubs scouts busy in Ligue 1. Chris Waters palacetrust.org.uk, @Clapham_Grand Everton The way we faltered after that strong start shows we need to strengthen all over the pitch if were going to make progress. A new keeper would be an obvious place for Ronald Koeman to start: ideally Pickford from Sunderland or Heaton from Burnley, but most of the talk at the moment is about outfield players, including Charltons Ademola Lookman and Uniteds Morgan Schneiderlin. Whatever happens, we need some options to replace Barry and Jagielka: theyve been great servants, but its a young mans game. Steve Jones @bluekippercom Hull City There isnt a single outfield position that doesnt need improving  but a proper right-back and someone to put the ball in the net are key. With his nous and obvious threat, Peter Crouch would be useful  and Scott Hogan at Brentford is a good finisher whod be a better long-term investment. Elsewhere, if were going to continue to play with three centre-halves, we need another one  like Sunderland found in Lamine Kon. And all this is assuming we keep hold of Snodgrass, Robertson and other players linked with moves. We just cant go through what we went through in the summer again when we lost Mo Diam, despite already being critically short of players. Rick Skelton boothferrytowembley.blogspot.com, @HullCityLive Leicester City We desperately need a new centre-back to offer some decent cover in case Morgan or Huth get injured. Michael Keane has been touted, and we could do worse. Similarly, we need another winger to compensate for Riyad Mahrezs Africa Cup of Nations duties. But most importantly, we need a ball-winning midfielder to try to fill the NGolo Kant hole  thankfully, it sounds like a deal is pretty much done for Wilfred Ndidi from Genk. Hopefully, well have time to find a new head of recruitment too. Chris Whiting thechriswhitingshow.wordpress.com, @ChrisRWhiting Liverpool Even though weve been scoring freely we do need a top striker. Coutinho is likely to get knocked about and miss games throughout the season, Man is off to the Africa Cup of Nations and we cant rely on Sturridge. Celtics Moussa Dembl has been linked, but not only with us, and theres talk about PSGs Jes Rodriguez. We could also do with a defender: Newcastles Jamaal Lascelles was linked before Christmas  Rafa wont be happy  and a left-back, with Ricardo Rodrguez from Wolfsburg and Colognes Jonas Hector mentioned. Elsewhere, our keepers have struggled, but Karius is young and can hopefully learn and improve. Quickly, with luck. Steph Jones Observer reader Manchester City Our defence is a mess - the problems wont be solved in one window, but signing Virgil van Dijk from Southampton would be a big step in the right direction. Meanwhile, Ilkay Gndogans injury is a massive blow, so a move for another midfielder could be on the cards. It sounds like were close on Sevillas Steven NZonzi, but I hope were also serious about Mahmoud Dahoud. Hes undoubtedly a star in the making and has impressed whenever weve played Mnchengladbach. Lloyd Scragg mcfcwatch.com, @lloyd_scragg Manchester United We havent been scoring enough. Theres been some encouraging talk about a big bid for Antoine Griezmann, whod be one of the final pieces in Joss jigsaw, but that wont happen this month. So Mourinho may go for another option  possibly young Kasper Dolberg from Ajax  given that Martial, Rooney and Rashford havent been delivering. To do that, though, hell probably have to offload some fringe players such as Fellaini, Memphis and Schneiderlin  particularly if hes also serious about spending big money on Benfica defender Victor Lindelof. Shaun ODonnell Observer reader Middlesbrough We have to try to strengthen in attack and midfield, and focus on bringing in experience  we look so vulnerable whenever Ramrez and Negredo are missing. Weve not been shy to add quality players in previous January windows, and I think well see a bold survival strategy emerge this month. It has taken us seven years to get back to this level and well throw everything we can at staying in the top-flight. Rudy Gestede would give us another option, though I think most fans would prefer some more dynamic signings. Could we have the manager to realise the untapped potential of Evertons Gerard Deulofeu? Wed then have former Bara youth players attacking down both flanks. Robert Nichols fmttm.com, @rob_fmttm Southampton What do we need this month? A striker who scores goals. Literally any striker who scores goals. Spend all the money we have on Daniel Sturridge if hes willing and available. Add a fit and clinical goalscorer to the mix  and keep hold of Virgil van Dijk at the back  and were a potential top-six side again. Steve Grant saintsweb.co.uk, @SteveGrant1983 Stoke City Lee Grant and Bruno Martins Indi should be first in on permanent deals: theyve been instrumental. Beyond those two, we all thought Bony was going to be the answer to our scoring issues but that really hasnt worked out  so expect interest in Saido Berahino (again), RB Leipzigs Davie Selke, or Napolis Manolo Gabbiadini. Elsewhere, if theres a player out there who could challenge Erik Pieters at left back we should be looking at him. As good as Eric is he does suffer from having no competition for his place whatsoever. And Jack Butlands ongoing injury problems mean another keeper, alongside Lee Grant, could be on the cards. Rob Holloway Observer reader Sunderland A big month for David Moyes coming up. Were told theres a limited budget but we need at least two more defenders. Carl Jenkinson has been mentioned, but well need another centre-back too as Kon will be missing one way or the other  either sold, or off on Africa Cup of Nations duties. Elsewhere we have to do whatever it takes to hang on to Jermain Defoe  we could do without Sam Allardyce and Slaven Bilic distracting him. Other than that, I guess well be checking to see if there are any out-of-contract former Everton players knocking around  and it wouldnt come as a big surprise if Peter Crouch pitched up. But not Dimitar Berbatov  far too pricey for a low wage economy like ours. Pete Sixsmith SalutSunderland.com Swansea City The first half of the season was a disaster; to turn this round the new manager has to make multiple changes. Among the most urgent needs are a centre-back to replace Ashley Williams, at least one full-back and a winger  but we could also do with a decent central midfielder to replace the substandard Ki Sung-yueng. Realistically, though, its hard to imagine us managing to land more than three players this month, given the state were in. Kevin Elphick Swansea.vitalfootball.co.uk Tottenham Hotspur Pochettino talks about how we need more quality even though our squad is very strong, with a tight wage structure. We could use some extra creativity, pace and goal threat  but then who couldnt use those qualities? Wilfried Zaha would be interesting  but to improve what we already have is a tall ask with a new stadium to finance. Dave Mason Observer reader Watford Our squad is as strong as its ever been, and the signings of Okaka, Success and Pereyra giving us an attacking armoury we didnt have last term. However, Pereyras injury  combined with the impending losses of Amrabat and Guedioura to the Africa Cup of Nations  mean that we need at least temporary cover in attacking midfield positions. Matt Rowson bhappy.wordpress.com, @mattrowson West Bromwich Albion We still lack strength in depth and were a couple injuries away from relying on players who would struggle. Theres been lots of talk about Morgan Schneiderlin, but the biggest concern is cover for Salomn Rondn. Thats the key area that needs strengthening. We were linked with Rudy Gestede but it sounds like hes off to Boro. Richard Jefferson wbaunofficial.org.uk/forum, @richbaggie West Ham United A proven Premier League striker who can remain fit is essential this month  Christian Benteke would have done the job, but as it is were apparently after loan options. Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Michy Batshuayi have all been mentioned. Were also after another right back  Carl Jenkinson from Arsenal?  and, if Payet goes, another creator, too. Wed love a fit Santi Cazorla in exchange, but Gylfi Sigurdsson of Swansea always strikes me as an underrated player. Pete May Author of Goodbye to Boleyn; blog: hammersintheheart.blogspot.co.uk','sport'),(102,'Prior to its publication last January, Joanna Cannons debut novel was tipped as a likely hit of 2016 and the author appeared in the Observers annual New Year feature about debut novelists to watch. Expectations were fulfilled and The Trouble With Goats and Sheep became a bestseller; less foreseeable was quite how prescient this winning parable would come to seem over the course of the year. The action centres on the baking summer of 1976 and while heatwaves have been the focus of other debuts  The Cement Garden most (in)famously  the weather here is skilfully promoted from backdrop to insidious personality: oppressive; coercive; according to some of the residents of the avenue responsible for all kinds of strange behaviour. However, we soon realise that there is more to the disappearance of No 8s Mrs Creasy than a rush of blood to the head, and that conspiracy, not borrowed cups of sugar, has been holding the neighbourhood together. The novel alternates between the perspectives of the avenues adult residents and the first-person narration of 10-year-old bright-spark Grace, whose precocity is robust enough to offset suspicions of feyness, in spite of her fondness for Angel Delight. Along with her sidekick, Tilly, she decides to track down the missing woman, a mission that is part public service, part divine duty: sheep need a shepherd to keep them safe. The vicar said so, she informs her mother. It hardly needs saying that the books sheep and goats, sinners and saints, turn out not to be separate species but one and the same. Moreover Cannon, a psychiatric doctor, suggests economically and with sensitivity the secrets, shame and sorrow that lurk behind every net curtain, as well as the toxicity of the mob, the us-and-them mentality that festers throughout the book. Even its moments of out-of-the-mouths-of-babes humour come with a subtle reminder, elsewhere, that it is not just phrases but prejudices that young minds pick up. Although the books messages  of acceptance, empathy and compassion  are unmistakable, it is never preachy; plot and structure are deftly, cleverly handled and descriptions combine delicacy with flair, perhaps most notably in the case of a river of starlings spinning out their harmony across a bleached sky. With its combination of wit and heart, its easy to see why Cannons tale earned so many fans; with its implicit plea for understanding it will doubtless continue to add them in the months to come. &nbsp;The Trouble With Goats and Sheep by Joanna Cannon is published by The Borough Press (7.99).

Whenever possible I like to take a print back to give to those Ive documented, and in my bag I have a photograph I took of the couple two years before. But should I give it to them? In the picture Khouloud, paralysed from the neck down, lies in the tent she shares with her family in Lebanons Bekaa valley. Jamal sits at the end of her bed, holding her hand, the couple looking at each other with a love that is at odds with the stark, grainy black-and-white image that reflects the truth of their desperate situation. If there is one image that betrays my belief in the power of photography to create change, its this one. For here we are, two years later, sitting in that same dark oppressive tent and nothing has changed. Naively perhaps, Id believed that telling Khoulouds story would have made a difference, and I cant help feeling I failed them. Finally, I reach down and take the photograph out of my bag. As I hand it to them I say: When I took this two years ago, I didnt take a photograph of a refugee, I didnt take a photograph of a disabled woman; instead I took a photograph of a couple who are deeply in love, and thats what this will always mean to me. In 2014 I went to Lebanon with Handicap International to document some of Syrias most vulnerable refugees. The sick, the elderly, single-parent families and those living with disabilities. People like 38-year-old Reem. She was in bed at home in Idlib, Syria, when a rocket hit her house. Her husband was killed next to her, one of her children also died, and Reem lost a leg. When I met her she was living in a tent on the top floor of an unfinished building. She was still learning to use her prosthesis and was unable to use the stairs, leaving her trapped. She didnt want her surviving children to live with her  she felt ashamed because she believed her disability meant she couldnt be a mother to them. Only her father, Abdel, lived with her on the rooftop. As I was taking his photograph, Abdel kept looking to the side, his eyes focused on the distant snow-capped mountains. I asked why he kept looking that way. Those mountains, he replied, are my home. I am an old man and may never return home, but at least each morning its the first thing I see, and when I go to bed the last. Over the following weeks I met dozens of Syrians like Reem, fighting for survival and dignity as refugees in Lebanon. In 2014 the situation was already desperate, with over a million Syrians sheltering in a county of just four million. The infrastructure was close to collapse. Recovering from a life-changing accident myself (in 2011 I was injured while working in Afghanistan), that trip to Lebanon and the people I met were to have a profound effect both on my life and my work. But it was in meeting Khouloud  and, later, a girl called Aya  that I would find true inspiration and a renewed purpose for my photography In 2013 Khouloud, 32, was working in her garden with her children when a sniper shot her through the spine. She collapsed, paralysed from the neck down. I tried to plant a small area of land near our house as it wasnt possible to get vegetables like before, she said. I was taking care of the plants with my four children and suddenly a bullet hit my neck and I fell down and lost sensation. I could not move any more. After her initial treatment her family managed to get her out of Syria. Eventually they found themselves living in an informal tented settlement in Lebanons Bekaa valley, one of thousands of unofficial camps dotted across the country. When we met shed been there for five months. The UNHCR was providing food coupons but the family was struggling. Her husband has to provide Khouloud with 24-hour care. I asked her: Whats your hope for the future? To be a mother again, she replied. I wish I could move my fingers because sometimes my son is injured outside and he comes in next to me. He moves my hand and he puts my fingers on to the wound. I wish I could move my fingers to touch him and make him feel like I am feeling the wound with him. What struck me was the love within that family. Despite everything they had been through and the incredible suffering they still endured, there was laughter, hope and affection. They treated me like a family member. Despite having so little, they cooked and shared what they had. When I met Aya she was sitting alone on a concrete floor in a dark, damp tent. She has spina bifida, which means she is paralysed from the waist down and the curvature in her spin makes it hard to sit upright unaided. She was four years old. Seeing her there, I thought I couldnt take her photograph. She seemed so vulnerable, and that goes against the way I like to work. Yet Aya was to prove me wrong. She turned out to be the feistiest four-year-old Id ever met. I spent the day with her family, and her mother, Sihan, told me about Ayas relationship with her sister, Iman. The two were inseparable. When their house in Idlib was bombed, it was Iman, only 10 herself, who held Aya in the basement where they sheltered for three days. With no food or water, she never let her sister go. Then, on the perilous journey from Syria to Lebanon, which took them several weeks, it was Iman who carried Aya. Iman walked into the tent while we were talking, and I expected to see that tenderness. Instead, Aya looked up at her sister and exclaimed Pick me up, Donkey! Over the coming weeks I revisited them and  as with Khouloud and her family  witnessed the strength of their love and unity. One of the hardest things was listening to Ayas father, Ayman, talking about the possibility of splitting his family up. Things were so desperate: living in a makeshift tent, the children often sick, he not allowed to work because of his refugee status, the family sinking further and further into debt, and Aya not getting the medical support she desperately needed. The other children werent attending school and Ayman was considering sending them to live with others. Their most immediate concern was whether Aya would survive the winter. On my last day there, as the family attempted to winter-proof their tent with materials supplied by the UNHCR, Sihan was in tears as she told me that she doubted Aya could survive these hardships. But Aya had other thoughts. She interrupted her mother to exclaim with typical defiance: Aya doesnt die! In the end I did take a photograph of Aya. It was of her playing hopscotch with Iman. She is laughing, and in that moment you see her strength and passion for life. After returning home I often thought of the families Id met. Some I managed to stay in contact with. Others, I had no idea of their fate. Then, in 2015, the UNHCR commissioned me to document the refugee crisis across Europe and the Middle East. Its brief was simple: Follow your heart. The project began in Lesbos, documenting scenes we are all too familiar with. I followed the refugees journey to Berlin, criss-crossing Europe, trying to record stories. However, I knew that if I was to fully fulfil my brief and follow my heart, Id have to return to Lebanon. So in February 2016 I went back. I visited Aya and her family. They had moved out of the tent and, thanks to assistance from the UNHCR, were now living in a rented room on the outskirts of Tripoli. It wasnt much, but at least it provided proper shelter, and the children seemed much healthier. Aya was her normal feisty self and had grown up so much. Her new hobby was painting her nails and trying out hairstyles. I photographed her being pushed around in her wheelchair by her brothers, screaming Faster! Faster! I have some understanding of the pain that she is in each day and her struggles with disability  yet I have never heard her complain. Life was still hard. What support the family received barely covered rent and food. While the kids could attend school, often they missed classes because the family could not pay the bus fare. Ayman still wasnt allowed to work. Many days were spent sitting around the house. The family, like most refugees, were stuck in limbo. When I first met Ayas family they talked of returning to Syria as soon as possible. After over five years of war, they were now questioning if they could ever return. And even if they did, what would be left? The schools, hospitals and businesses lie in ruins; their own house is destroyed. What future would they have? With the prospects of a return to Syria dwindling and life in Lebanon impossible, their hope now was for resettlement. I never wanted to go to Europe, so far from Syria, Ayman said, but if this gives my children a chance of a future, then I will go. They had been put forward by the UNHCR for resettlement in France, but months had passed and still no news. They were losing hope. I also returned to see Reem. I was happy to see she was now able to negotiate the stairs, and her daughter, Sarah, was living with her again. That evening I sat with the family (Reems two brothers had joined her, living on the roof-top), drinking coffee and eating homemade bread from the open fire. In so many ways, life was normal. The family joked and laughed, reminisced about life back in Syria, discussed food and football. But for the refugees living in Lebanon, nothing is normal. Like Ayas family they were stuck, unable to build new lives or plan futures. I managed to track down most of those Id met on my first visit, but in the chaos it was hard to trace everyone. On my last day I got a phone call. It was Khoulouds family. Shed heard I was back and wanted me to visit. When I asked where she was living, I was told she was in the same tent Id seen her in two years before. I felt like Id been punched in the stomach. How could she still be living in that tent? Of all those Id visited in 2014, Khoulouds situation had seemed the most desperate. A tetraplegic woman living in a makeshift tent with her husband as full-time carer. Id told her story and yet nothing had changed. I felt as if I had failed them. I extended my stay in Lebanon and went to see them. For over two years Khouloud had not moved from her bed, staring at the ceiling of the one room that they lived in. Yet still she remained positive; full of laughter and knowing smiles. Jamal still looked at her with, he said, all the love he had when they first met. The children do their homework on the bed with their mother, and they always eat together as a family. Astonishingly, the tent was a place filled with positivity, laughter and kindness. Over the days that followed I tried to capture that story through my photographs, I wanted to tell their story again. On the last day I gave them that photograph Id taken two years before  with the promise that this time Id make sure people heard their story. Just a few months later, in August 2016, I was in San Francisco, giving a talk. The idea was to raise funds and awareness of the crisis in Lebanon. After the talk I received an email from Philip Schneider, who manages the global community event Gishwhes and is also on the board of a charity called Random Acts. Set up by American actor Misha Collins in 2010, Random Acts has a simple mission statement: Conquer the world, one random act of kindness at a time. Key to its work is a network of connected people who use social media to raise awareness and help individuals and communities. After seeing the photographs and hearing the stories of Aya and Khouloud at the talk, Schneider was so moved that he wanted to combine the Gishwhes and Random Acts networks to see what could be done to help. Things moved fast. They set up a crowdfunding page, and the combined online communities started donating and spreading the word. In situations like these, its hard to know how one can help, wrote Schneider on their website, but Gishwhes and Random Acts have decided that while we may not be able to solve Syrias problems, making some small impact is better than standing idly by, doing nothing. Therefore, we have narrowed the scope and we are going to radically change the material situation of a few families that have suffered tremendously from this conflict. In the days and weeks that followed, I sat glued to their fundraiser page. From over 20 countries, hundreds of people donated, often just 10 or 20 dollars. But the impact of so many people coming together to create change was dramatic. Within a month, over $200,000 was raised. Random Acts is now in the process of moving Khouloud and other families in Lebanon into flats, getting them medical treatment and making sure a trust is set up so the children can attend school until they are 18. No matter what your political persuasion, it cant be denied that, in 2016, compassion, tolerance and empathy took a beating. But this generosity and compassion is inspiring. The issues of the world can seem overwhelming but  even if just for a few families  this proves that the kindness of strangers can change lives. Around the same time I received further good news: as part of UNHCRs resettlement scheme, Aya and her family were to start a new life in France. Theyd be leaving Lebanon in less than two weeks. Sihan, Ayas mother, fretted about what they should take. They were allowed a suitcase each, and into those she packed blankets (for she had been told it was cold) and bags of dried thyme, cumin and Arabic coffee (she wanted to carry a taste of home). None of them had flown before. When they boarded the plane in Beirut the family was terrified. Apart from Aya, who, Im told, did up her seat belt and said Lets go! A few days later I visited them at their new home in Laval, an hours drive from Paris. Their flat is in a new block on the edge of a small town. Its quiet, with gardens where the children can play. Random Acts helped provide Aya with a state-of-the-art wheelchair, and for the first time in her life she can fulfil her dream of attending school. Eating dinner with the family, I realised, that despite knowing them for over two years, it was the first time Id seen Ayas parents smile. It was as if a great weight had been lifted from them. As I was leaving, Sihan told me with tears in her eyes, about the first night they slept in their new flat. Aya often struggles to sleep, but on that night, as she put Aya to bed, Sihan was able to whisper to her: Its OK, this is your home now.','entertainment'),(104,'Star of the year Cristiano Ronaldo  won a fourth Ballon dOr, launched a range of CR7 blankets, tossed a microphone into a lake, inspired a tantrum meme, and hosted the eras defining football press conference, with the press banned from asking questions.

Im joking of course, because, as we know from our recent attempts to have a nuclear war, nuclear weapons turn out never to have existed  or only briefly. It seems the original plans for the atom bomb were destroyed to prevent them falling into the hands of the Area 51 alien, who didnt actually have any hands, just sort of suckers, and was subsequently discovered not to be an alien but an incredibly inaccurate model of the Michelin man constructed out of cork by a midwestern garage owner based on instructions hed been given on a crackly phone line in French. So, for most of the nuclear age, the notion of the weapons themselves was just a conspiracy by the rulers of the worlds leading nations to siphon off large sections of their respective defence budgets to spend on canaps. As a rogue CIA agent confessed on a YouTube video he released just before disappearing into the Cloud via a bizarre human-body-uploader hed made out of a Portaloo, a liquidiser and a modem: There are only two secrets you need to know: nuclear weapons dont exist and unicorns do.

Hollywood to release remakes first It is a work of accounting genius, explained a Hollywood insider. Statistically, remakes do the business. They make much more money, on average, than films that arent remakes. Perhaps not quite as much as the films that warrant being remade but thats a detail. The irrefutable fact is that the remake is the most profitable form of film. So theyve got to be released first. We make a film, bury it, remake it, release the remake  then we can stick the original on YouTube or as a DVD extra, who cares? It is literally innumerate to claim this will not work. Britain becomes last member state of the European Union Our former European partners stole a march on us in February by all simultaneously triggering article 50 and leaving the EU a fortnight later, leaving Britain the only remaining member of an organisation it long ago resolved to leave.

Age 21 Joey Carbery started the year playing for Clontarf and finished it with three caps, the first coming against New Zealand in Chicago when he replaced Jonny Sexton with 22 minutes to go and coolly guided his forwards around the field to help Ireland achieve a historic victory over the All Blacks. His first start for Leinster had come two months before but Carbery kept his nerve and played with an assurance beyond his years. He was promoted early because Ian Madigan became fed up with understudying Sexton and moved to France and Paddy Jackson was unavailable for the international in America. Carbery, who was born in New Zealand but moved to Ireland when he was 11, is a fly-half who stands flat and maximises his attacking options. It took him three minutes on his first full appearance for Leinster in September to announce himself, receiving the ball on his own 10-metre line against Treviso and confounding three defenders to score the first of two tries. Ireland have a succession plan for Sexton. Keelan Giles Ospreys, wing. Age 18 Keelan Giles turns 19 at the end of January having become the most talked about player in Wales in the autumn. He sat on the bench against Japan but did not come on, because victory was only secured in the final minute. His scoring rate for his region is more than one try a match and he has notched five in six appearances for Wales Under-20s. Comparisons have been made with Shane Williams  quick footwork and acceleration and he is deceptively strong. It is a case of when he makes his international debut, with Wales inviting him to train with the team at the end of last summers tour to New Zealand, after the Junior World Cup, to integrate him early. Japan looked the perfect opportunity with Wales picking experienced three-quarters in Jamie Roberts, Jonathan Davies and Leigh Halfpenny, but a change in playing style from wallop to gallop has bred an initial uncertainty and he was held in reserve. The Wales coaches need to make a statement to show players they mean what they say and Giles lining up in Rome at the start of the Six Nations would be a loud declaration of intent. Joe Marchant Harlequins, outside-centre. Age 20 Joe Marchant plays like a No13 of old, quick feet and a burst of pace, looking to attack defenders on their outside shoulder. The World Rugby Under-20 Championship final between England and Ireland was ignited by Marchant, who scored a try from 40 metres, stepping out of one tackle and then another before accelerating away. He has profited from the experience around him at Harlequins, where he has Jamie Roberts and Nick Evans inside and Mike Brown outside, but he is a player who lives off his wits, as he showed when picking up a bouncing ball near his own line against Worcester and sidestepping two tacklers to reach the safety of the 22. Marchant is in a position where England are hardly struggling for options but, having been called into the 45-man elite player squad on Saturday, he is clearly impressing Eddie Jones, who has talked about the need to work on Englands attack. In Marchant, he has a merchant of menace. Christian Scotland-Williamson Worcester, second-row. Age 23 Worcester surprised many when they included Scotland-Williamson in their second row at Bristol instead of the vastly more experienced Donncha OCallaghan. The clubs academy product, who missed most of the past two seasons with a back problem that required surgery, was one of the few Warriors who were up for the relegation fight, scrapping for possession and looking to get his hands on the ball. At 6ft 9in and more than 19st, he is one of the more imposing forwards in the top flight but injury slowed his progress and he made his Premiership debut this season. Second row is another position where England have ample resources but Jones is not a coach who is ever satisfied. He will be using Englands summer tour to Argentina to look at the next generation of players and someone impressing in a struggling side will not be lost on him. Scotland-Williamson has been compared to Courtney Lawes with his ability to make dents in defences and haul down ball-carriers, big, strong and athletic. Billy Searle Bristol, fly-half. Age 20 Billy Searle joined Bristols academy in the summer after moving from Plymouth Albion. The intention was to blood him in the Anglo-Welsh Cup but a series of injuries at 10, including their recruit Shane Geraghty, led to him starting in the European Challenge Cup at Bath and he has taken the field in seven of Bristols last eight matches, including last weeks basement fight against Worcester despite the return of Tusi Pisi, who was moved to the centre. Searle quickly made an impact, using space created by defenders tightly marking Will Hurrell to make a break and set up Tom Varndell for the first of the wings three tries. If Searle showed signs of inexperience towards the end, throwing risky passes when the need was to keep the lead, he had more than proved his worth, varying his game and dictating in a way his opposite number was unable to, despite having a man advantage for most of the match. He is a modern outside-half and it is no coincidence that since his elevation, Varndell is scoring tries again. Thomas Young Wasps, flanker. Age 24 Thomas Young has been overlooked by Wales despite his outstanding club form and a footballing ability his country is crying out for. Perhaps it would be different if he were a three-quarter but Wales are at a point where, looking to boost their regional game, they are placing a quota on players who are based outside their country. Size was used as an argument against Young, who stands less than 6ft, but as emphasis shifts to use of the ball it should be time for a rethink. Young has the handling skills, adept at drawing tacklers and off-loading, he has pace and he has a breakaways instinct for being in the right place. There is more than a touch of Martyn Williams about him, a constant link between forwards and backs. He is the perfect fit for Wasps, who look to capitalise in broken play, and if Wales are serious about overhauling their style of play will it make sense to keep overlooking him, even with Justin Tipuric in their squad?','sport'),(107,'Scotland looks set to be the first part of the UK to pilot a basic income for every citizen, as councils in Fife and Glasgow investigate trial schemes in 2017. The councillor Matt Kerr has been championing the idea through the ornate halls of Glasgow City Chambers, and is frank about the challenges it poses. Like a lot of people, I was interested in the idea but never completely convinced, he said. But working as Labours anti-poverty lead on the council, Kerr says that he kept coming back to the basic income. Kerr sees the basic income as a way of simplifying the UKs byzantine welfare system. But it is also about solidarity: it says that everyone is valued and the government will support you. It changes the relationship between the individual and the state. The concept of a universal basic income revolves around the idea of offering every individual, regardless of existing welfare benefits or earned income, a non-conditional flat-rate payment, with any income earned above that taxed progressively. The intention is to provide a basic economic platform on which people can build their lives, whether they choose to earn, learn, care or set up a business. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has suggested that it is likely to appear in his partys next manifesto, while there has been a groundswell of interest among anti-poverty groups who see it as a means of changing not only the relationship between people and the state, but between workers and increasingly insecure employment in the gig economy. Kerr accepts that, while he is hopeful of cross-party support in Glasgow, there are months of work ahead, including first arranging a feasibility study in order to present a strong enough evidence base for a pilot. But if there is ever a case to be made then you need to test it in a place like Glasgow, with the sheer numbers and levels of health inequality. If you can make it work here then it can work anywhere. The idea has its roots in 16th-century humanist philosophy, when it was developed by the likes of Thomas More, but in its modern incarnation it has lately enjoyed successful pilots in India and Africa. Despite its utopian roots, champions believe that this is an idea whose time has come, particularly in Scotland where the governing SNP voted in support of a basic income at their spring conference (although the proposal has yet to make it into their manifesto). At the heart of any experiment with basic income is money: how much should people get and where will it come from? Kerr says his instinct is to base the amount on similar calculations to those made for the living wage. Its about having more than just enough to pay the bills. But part of the idea of doing a pilot is to make mistakes and also find out what is acceptable to the public. There will be a lot of resistance to this. We shouldnt kid ourselves. Part of the problem is were working against a whole discourse of deserving and undeserving poor. As for where the money comes from, the funding question is always the big one, and really will depend upon the approach a pilot takes, says Jamie Cooke, head of RSA Scotland, which has been spearheading research on the subject across the UK. Drawing on the experience of similar projects ongoing in Finland, Utrecht in the Netherland and Ontario in Canada, Cooke suggests: It could be funding from particular trusts, it could be individual philanthropic funding, as we have seen in the States, or it could be a redirection of the existing welfare spend. Obviously the latter is much harder to do in a pilot, although that will be happening in Finland next year where the experiment is being taken forward by the national government. As the Scottish government consults on what it has described as the biggest transfer of powers since devolution began  the devolution of around 2.7bn, or 15% of the total Scottish benefits bill, affecting 1.4 million people  both Kerr and Cooke believe that this is an ideal moment to consider the basic income seriously. Its a time to be testing out new  or rather old  ideas for a welfare system that genuinely supports independence, says Kerr. Cooke likewise believes that cross-party support is key, pointing to the fact that the leader of the Conservative group on Fife council has joined forces with the Fairer Fife Commission, the councils independent poverty advisory group which initially recommended the trial, with the aim of designing a pilot within the next six months. Scotland was recently added to the list of places to watch for basic income activity by the Basic Income Earth Network, founded by the radical economist Guy Standing, whose hugely influential book The Precariat identified an emerging social class suffering the worst of job insecurity and most likely to be attracted to rightwing populism. The thing about Scotland is that they really understand the precariat, says Standing, who recently visited the country to meet civil servants, local authorities and campaigners to discuss a basic income. The sense of insecurity, the stagnating living standards, all of those things are clear in Scotland and the fact that so many within the SNP are supportive means theres a real opportunity to do a pilot in Scotland. The momentum is there, he says, and once it is framed around a desire for greater social justice then you get away from the stale debate about whether if you give people the basic income then they will be lazy. People relate to the idea that everyone should have a social dividend. Everywhere I go, its the communities that feel left behind by globalisation that are most interested [in the idea of a basic income]. We have seen a sea-change in attitudes. This sense of alarm about populist rightwing politics has brought more people to thinking we need to do something to provide better security for people. We are risking our economic and political stability if we dont do something about it.','politics'),(108,'In her professional debut, Morfydd Clark was upstaged by a lamb. Shed nabbed the title part in Blodeuwedd  its the Welsh Juliet  staged on a Snowdonian hillside in 2013. But as if elaborate Welsh-language poetry and swarms of midges werent challenging enough, one evening this lamb came on  it was in July when theyre really not little and cute anymore  and baaa-ed loudly through the love scene. Lamb aside, Clark has had little problem holding her own on stage, and these days her fellow performers include Glenda Jackson, Dominic West and Rhys Ifans. Shes played the actual Juliet opposite Freddie Foxs Romeo, won praise from critics in Gary Owens Violence and Son at the Royal Court, and starred in Les Liaisons Dangereuses at the Donmar. She rounded off 2016 by playing Cordelia opposite Glenda Jacksons King Lear at the Old Vic. I knew her as a politician and found her fascinating; she wiped the floor with anyone, because she can perform, says Clark, who was thrilled to play her daughter, especially getting a cuddle each night while playing dead. Do we need to see more gender-blind casting? With Shakespeare, theres no reason not to, Clark insists, before adding that its no substitute for writing towering parts for women. I want men to be asking to play great female parts! Still, shes had no problem winning juicy roles, and they keep her coming back to the theatre. Clark has given notable screen performances in The Falling and opposite Kate Beckinsale in Love &amp; Friendship, but while she loves films, as a girl, often the characters youre auditioning for in the theatre are more significant. She was raised in Cardiff, and dropped out of school at 16, having struggled with dyslexia and ADHD. I had zero confidence, I didnt do well, I was in trouble a lot. Her mother, who works in child development, told her: Youre not sitting here, wasting your life, and so Clark applied to the National Youth Theatre of Wales, the National Youth Theatre of Great Britain and Welsh National Youth Opera. She got in to all three. It was totally life-changing. Not just being on stage, but spending time with adults who didnt just tell me off. After attending the National Youth Theatre of Wales, she studied at Drama Centre London  a wrench to leave her beloved Cardiff, but now very much home. In 2017, she will be seen in Interlude in Prague, a film about Mozart, and is currently auditioning for plays. She says: Ive done two Shakespeare tragedies, so Id desperately like to do comedy.

A call-centre worker with a high-pitched screech croons velvety Adele songs in between calls. Talk show host Windy Le Fontaine LDoeuf dispenses dubious life advice and recipes for increasingly improbable dishes, not least of which is her big pot of glams. This sequence of surreal characters is vividly brought to life by 26-year-old south Londoner Lolly Adefope, whose own persona occasionally makes an onstage appearance to undercut the jokes with equally funny barbed asides. The fourth wall is also broken to incorporate viewers in unwinnable game shows. Its a thrilling experience, often playing on audience awkwardness about race and the fear of living in an echo chamber. Inspired by an early love for Brass Eye and The Day Today, and more recently US shows like Atlanta and Insecure,Adefope developed a taste for bizarre but topical humour. After an English degree at Loughborough university followed by an unfulfilling job (it was so boring youre going to regret asking), she started doing open mic nights and getting small roles on TV shows. In her Edinburgh debut, 2015s double Chortle award-nominated and Jon Ronson-endorsed Lolly, she impersonated various characters who were part of a talent show. Critics praised her performance but a number of reviews remarked on the fact that she hardly referenced her race, with some suggesting she should talk about it more. I feel like a white comedian wont get told oh you never mentioned your race, she says when we meet in a crowded central London cafe. But thats not what the show was about. Its follow-up, Lolly2, was written partly in response to these reviews  some of which are quoted on a screen  and race is a central theme (in one memorable scene, an aspiring actor auditions for the role of Black Hermione). At the end theres a standing ovation from the (mostly white) crowd. Using characters gives Adefope a way of expressing anger and addressing politically charged subjects such as Brexit and #OscarsSoWhite at one step removed. If I was doing standup I would worry that someone would think I was being preachy, whereas, with a character, it always tends to be the opposite of what I think. You can get away with things. But none of the more serious points would be effective if the characters didnt work. Adefope steps from one persona to the next with ease, adopting finely tuned mannerisms, pitch-perfect accents, and a lot of sheer silliness. Between her standup, acting and increasingly frequent TV appearances, we can expect to see a lot more of her. Comedy is changing, she says. The appetite for more diverse stories is getting bigger. After my gig last week some people came up to me and said it was great to see themselves reflected. It was so nice because thats exactly what I feel like.

Accompanying her to hospital, he watched as doctors diagnosed malaria and prescribing various treatments accordingly. Only as she lay dying did they realise their initial diagnosis was wrong. It was pneumonia that was killing her. Turyabagye, 24, was so shocked by the circumstances surrounding the death that he began researching methodologies for diagnosing pneumonia and its treatments. To his surprise, he discovered that the illness affects far more children than it does adults. According to Unicef, pneumonia kills half a million children under five in sub-Saharan Africa every year, with the region accounting for half of all global deaths from pneumonia of children under five. Many of those deaths are because of misdiagnosis, says Turyabagye. In the villages and remote areas, children get sick  and the first reaction is to treat them for malaria. Most people are aware of malaria, and the signs for malaria and pneumonia are very similar, so it is difficult for health professionals to differentiate. Even when a correct diagnosis is made, treatment is often unavailable. According to the Uganda Paediatrics Association, fewer than 20% of children with pneumonia receive antibiotics, which cost less than $1 (81p). So Turyabagye began designing a biomedical smart jacket that would distinguish pneumonias symptoms  temperature, breathing rate and sound of the lungs  and eliminate most human error, diagnosing pneumonia at a rate three to four times faster than a doctor. He named it Mamaope, or mothers hope  a reference to the 27,000 children who die of pneumonia in Uganda every year. We focused on the distinguishing signs of pneumonia, says Turyabagye. One of the processes that most doctors use is a stethoscope to the check the lungs. But [pneumonia] tends to be on side points around the body, not just in the chest or back. Its accuracy of being able to diagnose what is healthy, and what is not, is very encouraging. Currently a prototype, the Mamaope jacket will undergo an official national medical examination in January. Certification for use in health centres and hospitals is expected by spring. The jacket could be a major boon to diagnosing, treating and preventing pneumonia in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite international progress tackling measles, HIV and Aids and tetanus, funding towards eradicating pneumonia remains extremely low: for every dollar spent on global health in 2011, Unicef says, only two cents went to pneumonia. Although sub-Saharan Africa accounts for half of pneumonia deaths among children under five worldwide, funding for pneumonia prevention, management and treatment in the region remains low, according to Mark Young, senior health specialist for Unicef. More resources and more commitment at the highest level will bring us closer to stopping this disease from being a major child killer. The Mamaope jacket was shortlisted for this years 25,000 Africa prize for engineering innovation, and Turyabagye hopes this could jumpstart mass production of the jacket for use across the continent. Really, we are looking to help the next generation, he says. Pneumonia has such a high rate in Uganda and our neighbouring countries, if we were able to distribute in those countries we could save a lot of people.','politics'),(111,'When you start the year as a FTSE 100 company, but end it in second place on the list of the modern Christmas cracker jokes (according to UKTVs comedy channel Gold) you can assume its been a challenging year. The company in question is, of course, Sports Direct, which spent 2016 engulfed by a crisis over pay and working conditions at its depot in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, where it was revealed that workers were effectively receiving less than the national minimum wage after unpaid body searches and tough financial penalties for slight lateness. Hence the chart-topping gag: what do workers at Sports Direct get for Christmas dinner? Answer: about five minutes. But was that really the funniest Sports Direct crack of the year? Maybe not. There was the one where founder Mike Ashley went through a mock security check as part of a PR campaign to demonstrate he really was a man of the people, only to then pull a wad of 50 notes out of his pocket; a similar joke about the company buying a private jet, but allowing staff to rent it for a commercial rate; plus another one when MPs visited Shirebrook only to discover they were being secretly recorded. Still, the most hilarious joke was surely delivered by chairman Keith Hellawell in September, when he refused to resign. A great year for fiction  in British politics The Man Booker prize for fiction went to Paul Beatty in 2016 for The Sellout  and no doubt it was well deserved too.

Pages from that tome included IMF boss Christine Lagardes We have done our homework and we havent found anything positive to say about a Brexit vote; JP Morgan chief Jamie Dimons warning he could cut 4,000 UK jobs if Britain voted to leave the EU; plus, of course, then chancellor George Osbornes warning that hed have to slash public spending and increase taxes in an emergency budget to tackle a 30bn black hole. We did vote to leave, of course, and FTSE quickly crashed, making all of the above look quite smart. The FTSE then rose above where it was before and never got that low again  while economic data stubbornly refused to fit in with the Remainers expectations. They currently look less smart. Shy and retiring Green heads for a big bash It is now eight months since BHS collapsed and six months since its former owner Sir Philip Green promised to sort the 571m pension deficit. BHS is still bust while Green is still working on a solution (and shouting at people). That is despite a year in which the constantly cross shopkeeper has been battling it out with his old pal Mike Ashley for the Fred Goodwin Silver Salver, which this page likes to award to Britains most despised business person. Greens reputation plummeted in 2016 after BHS failed just a year after he had sold the business to the astonishingly unsuitable Dominic Chappell for 1. Both men were then hauled in front of a joint select committee to explain themselves, an exercise that only succeeded in trashing their reputations some more. The MPs found that the department store had been subjected to systematic plunder by former owners, while Green gave insufficient priority to the pension scheme. Still, lets look on the bright side. Green is partial to having a small birthday party every five years (you know the sort of thing: music by Stevie Wonder, topless modelling by Simon Cowell) and his 2017 birthday is a significant one. In March, the retailing knight turns 65, at which point hell be able to draw his state, er, pension. So, Vladimir, where do you keep your savings? April saw the release of the Panama Papers, an unprecedented leak of 11.5&nbsp;million files from the database of the worlds fourth biggest offshore law firm, Mossack Fonseca. The records were obtained from an anonymous source by the German newspaper Sddeutsche Zeitung, which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). The ICIJ then shared them with a large network of international partners, including the Guardian, Observer and the BBC. Perhaps the most startling tale to emerge was the network of secret offshore deals and vast loans worth $2bn laying a trail to Russias president, Vladimir Putin. The presidents name did not appear in any of the records, but his friends earned millions from deals that seemingly could not have been secured without his patronage, while the documents suggested Putins family benefited from this money. The leak also showed a Panama-based offshore trust set up by David Camerons late father had benefited the then prime minister. He ended up making a complete hash of his response by stalling for three days, with four partial statements issued by Downing Street, before confessing he owned shares in the tax haven fund, which he sold for 31,500 just before becoming PM in 2010. Putins year improved. Camerons didnt. Gears start to grind in the gig economy Not a great year if you run a business in the so-called gig economy, as a number of moves threatened to improve the lot of workers at firms from Hermes to Deliveroo to Uber  and, possibly, undermine their business models. The UKs chief taxman referred Hermes to HMRC compliance officers following complaints by couriers that they were being paid at levels equivalent to below the national living wage. The move came after newspaper reports revealed that some self-employed couriers for the company, which delivers for retailers including John Lewis and Next, were taking home less than the legal minimum. Some 78 couriers subsequently made complaints to Frank Field, the chairman of the Commons work and pensions select committee. Meanwhile, Deliveroo was told in August that it must pay its workers the minimum wage unless a court rules that they are self-employed, while in November delivery firm CitySprint became embroiled in a similar dispute over the gig economy, when it faced demands to treat its freelance couriers as workers. That came a month after a tribunal ruled that Uber drivers were not self-employed and should be paid the national living wage, in a landmark case which could affect tens of thousands of workers in the gig economy. Uber immediately said it would appeal. The long and the short of it, courtesy of Sky If there is one issue I regard as crucial to successful investment, it is the need for a long-term approach ... Many people in the financial services industry now acknowledge the need for a seismic shift to long-termism, though sometimes this looks like lip service. That was Martin Gilbert, boss of Aberdeen Asset Management, in a blogpost in 2015. And it is also the same Gilbert who, wearing another hat as deputy chairman of Sky, sought instant gratification by waving through the idea that Rupert Murdochs 10.75-a-share bid for the TV group was fair  a conclusion he and his committee came to after a period of negotiation that lasted about 48 hours. Anyway, through 21st Century Fox Murdoch formally lodged an 11.7bn bid in December to take control of the two-thirds of Sky he doesnt already own, meaning he will now need to gain regulatory approval for the deal, which values Sky at more than 18bn. If it goes through, he would control Skys operations in the UK, Germany and Italy in addition to his ownership of the Times, Sunday Times and Sun, and the radio group TalkSport. Still, some shareholders and analysts accuse Sky of selling on the cheap, pointing out that the shares were at the offer level as recently as February. How Glasenberg dug himself out of a hole Considering he has made a habit of topping not-so-rich lists since floating Glencore in 2011, 2016 was a stellar year for the commodity traders second-largest shareholder and chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg. The shares have soared by about 200%, taking the value of his holding to more than 3bn and alleviating the crisis that reduced Glasenberg to his last billion. That turnaround was achieved by hauling Glencore out of its debt hole. Borrowings have been reduced from $30bn to $17.5bn by selling $6bn of assets, cutting expenditure and raising $2.5bn of fresh capital at 125p a share. Glasenberg himself had to write a $211m cheque during that cash call (which is rather impressive) but that punt has paid off handsomely and dividends are set to resume next year. Still, lets not be too charitable. For all the successes of 2016, it merely reversed some of the pain of previous years. Glasenbergs aggressive use of debt created the crisis for the company and the shares are still only worth about half of what they were when they listed at 530p, almost six years ago. Something like 2016s performance is required in 2017, therefore. Leicester won  but the bookies didnt lose When Leicester City won the Premier League in May  having started the season as a 5,000-1 shot  all the quoted bookmakers started whining that they had paid out 25m, which was dubbed the biggest loss in British history on a single sporting market. What a load of old nonsense that was. What really happened was the bookies coined it in all season on the back of unbelievably freakish results, only to hand a fraction of that back at the death. Even so, as this page never tires of pointing out, the myth of the bookies being fleeced by Leicesters triumph comes second only to the even more unbelievable line that the Foxes triumph was footballs greatest fairytale.

I looked at the stats recently and there are still only a handful of people of colour in each year, just as when I was there. Thats shocking.

A concern about inequality and justice has always been a part of me. Whether it was the result of being called Paki in the playground or because while we were considered poor by British standards, when we visited family in Karachi we were seen as insanely rich. Ten years ago, when Shaheen began a PhD, her mother became ill. Two months ago, she had a successful heart transplant. I thought it was amazing that someone gave her their heart.

A very serious-looking man with a laptop a couple of tables down keeps eye-rolling in her direction and its throwing her off her game. To be fair to him, a quiet cafe isnt Kloes natural environment: her sweary outbursts mix loudly with the sort of unvarnished opinions pop stars arent meant to give these&nbsp;days. Asked if shes annoyed that the nuanced pop of her debut EP Teenage Craze, or the fizzing follow-up singles UDSM and Liability, failed to earn her a spot on the BBC Sound of 2017 longlist, she gives the kind of answer her label Columbia might not want for the press release. I couldnt give two fucks, honestly, she says, a mischievous grin on her face. Im not going to rush my music out to get on a fucking poll and wank off Radio 1 for a bit. Bored senseless by school (I didnt like being patronised), Kloe studied her musical heroes, mixing an early love for Taylor Swift with her dads recommendations of Joni Mitchell and Bowie. Id sit with all their lyrics and chords and just study them. I think songwriting is so fascinating. An early acoustic singer-songwriter phase led to a Britains Got Talent audition at the age of 13 (thankfully, she didnt get through), while a YouTube channel still exists of her covering her favourite band, the 1975. Keen to keep her musical exploits secret at one of the worst schools in Glasgow, she took on dual roles: I was like Clydebanks Hannah Montana  on the weekends Id drink cider in the park with all the cool kids and then in the week Id lock myself in the music rooms and write songs. As she got older, her musical tastes evolved, taking in intelligent, emotion-led pop music by the likes of Charli XCX and Lorde; the latter she credits with changing the game and making a new lane for people like me. In 2015, she landed a record deal and her 2016 debut EP was given a huge lift after the delicate Grip, inspired by a drunken fumble with a bands frontman at a festival, was played by Zane Lowe. As with all Kloes songs, Grips magnetism comes from its lyrical honesty. You know you get revenge porn? Well, I do revenge songs, she says, before outlining a self-imposed ban on writing any more songs about boys. With her debut album currently taking shape between London and LA, Kloe is pragmatic about her current position in the pop cosmos. Well, sort of. I am Beyonc in my own head  Ive won five Grammys, Ive toured the world, played arenas  but no one knows who the fuck I am yet, she cackles. Thats categorically about to change.

That was in 1983, before they became clients of Brian Eno  and, arguably, the last time anyone had any peace on the first day of the year. New Years Eve raves routinely spill over into the next evening. The ceaseless chirrup of social media precludes silence. Into this clamour lands Reflection, the latest ambient work by Eno, the Roxy Music maverick who named this new genre in 1978 with Music For Airports, and whose cultural reach now spans the avant garde, Coldplay albums and generative apps.&nbsp;If your idea of an album is 12 or so&nbsp;tunes, Eno routinely bucks that set of&nbsp;strictures, even if his last album, The Ship  released last April  cleaved closer than most to tradition. Here, the one track unfurls very gradually over 54 minutes (and one second), its thrums and oscillations reverberating at a pace you might call glacial if the glaciers werent all melting in such a hurry. At seven minutes in, the tones gather momentum. At 21 minutes, theres something like the twitter of an electronic bird. It gets going again at the 47-minute mark, when the bell-like nuances once again turn up a notch. The overall effect is deeply, magnificently peaceful, meditative, even; ambient certainly monopolises certain sections of the thesaurus. Naysayers may liken ambient music to watching paint dry, but this is paint drying on a Mark Rothko canvas. The&nbsp;harder you tune in, the more there&nbsp;is to notice, the more you let it wash over you, the more it sucks you in to reveal internal structures. Throughout his long career, Eno has tinkered with gear and software that allows for the autonomous generation of sounds. As well as the standard version, Reflection also comes in premium generative editions. Core elements and sets of parameters fed in by Eno can be randomly recombined ad infinitum by a set of algorithms  a considerably gussied-up version of a Buddha machine, if you like. Reflection also  inevitably  throws up a set of reflections. The idea of authorship is a vexed question at the best of times, what with the death of the author, and the collaborative nature of vast amounts of art and cultural products. Pop routinely comes under fire for being written by committee. But if an algorithm composed this music, is Brian Eno the author of it? Geeks have long thrilled to the idea of computer-generated music; in Japan, they already have a virtual pop star called Hatsune Miku. Music analysis software exists that can predict hits with increasing accuracy, and Google Labs have an ersatz neural network up and running that can make convincing music. Along with all the other careers currently being destroyed by automation, it looks like that most notionally human of all  music  is under threat. If youre feeling paranoid as 2017 begins, the vast rippling peace of this album can suddenly take on a slightly sinister bent.','entertainment'),(115,'Hampshire-born actor Martin Freeman, 45, found fame as long-suffering sales rep Tim in The Office. He went on to play hero Bilbo Baggins in The Hobbit trilogy, with other film credits including Love Actually and The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. He was Emmy-nominated for the Fargo TV series and won a Bafta for his role as Dr John Watson in Sherlock, the BBCs contemporary reboot of Arthur Conan Doyles Sherlock Holmes detective stories, alongside Benedict Cumberbatchs high-functioning sleuth. Freeman has two children with actor Amanda Abbington, who plays Watsons wife, Mary, in Sherlock. Its exactly a year since the last episode of Sherlock. Where are the characters as we rejoin them? Well, John and Mary have a baby. A little daughter called Rosamund. Thats the big change in their lives but you cant change the dynamic of the show too much, so Watson is soon back on the mystery trail with Sherlock. The fabric of the series, after all, is the adventures of two weird blokes in London. Co-creator Steven Moffat says Sherlock is less of a dick this series. Is he? Yeah, hanging out with his best mate for a few years has had a slightly softening, humanising effect on Sherlock. If he hadnt picked up on some social clues from John Watson, hed be an idiot, not a genius. Although, of course, his abrasive side does still come out. You wouldnt want an episode of Sherlock where he didnt say something cutting and emotionally clueless. The last series climaxed with arch villain Moriarty seemingly taunting Sherlock from beyond the grave. Is he back? Moriarty is dead but its safe to say he may still play a part in our futures. There have been rumours of a shock twist where Why even finish that sentence? I already have a red laser dot on my forehead as youre asking. The BBC equivalent of Moriarty is about to snuff me out. Honestly, it will be a delight for you to wait and see. Watson is always stylishly dressed. Do you have input there? I have strong opinions but Sarah Arthur, the costume designer, is brilliant. Were of accord and weve sorted out Johns aesthetic. Its traditional English style thats a bit medical, a bit military  a nod to his professions  but hes also got to be ready for action. Theres always a dapper little detail  a bit of corduroy or tweed Absolutely. Theres no reason why Watson shouldnt care about what he wears. There is a bit of overlap with my own clothes but in my defence, I dont just pick things that I fancy nicking at the end of the series. Whats going on with Watsons hair this series? It looks longer, possibly greyer Hes just got different hair. Over the course of seven years, people do change their hairstyle. Its a bit of a new birth for him too. Hes a dad now and it signifies change. So its dad hair? I dont know what sort of dads youre knocking about with, who look that good. Watson spends much of his time wearing a papoose Indeed, as dads do nowadays. Its been a good few years since Ive worn one [Freemans own children are 10 and eight] and you forget what its like. It was all a trip down memory lane: the dash to the hospital, the sleepless nights, the fear and panic of becoming a parent. Not to mention inadvertently leaving the house with sick on my shoulder. WC Fieldss adage was, Never work with animals or children. How come there are both in the opening episode? As we were filming, we were asking Mark [Gatiss, co-creator and writer of the opening episode] what the hell he was thinking. Its page one of the showbiz manual but he put both in. To be fair, the bloodhound was much more badly behaved than the babies. Watsons wife, Mary, is played by your partner, Amanda Abbington. Does that make scenes easier or harder? Erm, well, Amanda and I arent together in real life any more. I dont know if you knew that. No. Im sorry. Its all right, its fine. Its been most of the year, actually. So we did this series not being together, which was kind of odd, although we were doing it as friends and were still very close. Its always interesting doing stuff with your partner because you know each other better than anybody else and that was obviously still the case with this series. But it wasnt lost on me and Amanda that, Oh look, were holding our fictional baby. Remember this? Statues of Margaret Thatcher get smashed in episode one. Are you prepared for accusations of BBC lefty luvvieness? Weirdly enough, it never occurred to me that smashing busts of Thatcher might be considered a little dig. Maybe we should have smashed a bust of Tony Blair just to even it up. Toby Jones guest stars in this series and looks like hes going to be great Thats where youre wrong, hes awful. No, Toby plays a great character and does a grand job. Hes a very unctuous, oily, truly horrific villain who the audience will enjoy despising. Would you say this is the darkest series yet? I would. There have always been grisly deaths and emotional turmoil in Sherlock. But pound for pound, yes, theres a little bit more dark grey, if not black. Sherlock is a global hit with a devoted fanbase. Whats that like? You could live three lifetimes and not hope to repeat this sort of success, so you cant be churlish about it. You have to take it as a huge compliment. What sort of gifts do fans send you? Things theyve clearly put a lot of thought and effort into. We get sent a lot of dolls. Knitted figures with, frankly, very good crochet work. A lot of intricate craft pieces, artwork, paintings. People really take time, which is lovely. Were you ever a fan of anything to that degree? No, I never crocheted anyone. If only I had the skills. I did write to the Style Council when they broke up, saying thanks and I really appreciate what youve done, but I dont think I ever posted the letter. When will we get more Sherlock? In all honesty, without being cagey, I have no idea. We take our time between series for various reasons, quality control not the least of them. So when the times right, well do it. Ive seen it. Theres a shark in it. (Laughs) Which is always good. Lets just hope we havent jumped it. Did you see David Walliams and Jack Whitehalls Sherlock spoof on sketch show Walliams &amp; Friend? Yes, it was quite funny. I applaud Jack, he gave it a good go. At least hes a similar physical type to Benedict: tall, good-looking and mysterious. But David just played me like he plays a lot of people  as a camp idiot. Or maybe thats what I am and dont realise. But I love David and Jack, they can carry on as far as Im concerned. Did you also see the David Brent film, Life on the Road, this summer? I did and really liked it. Ricky [Gervais] was careful not to make it a sequel to The Office, so the idea of me returning as Tim was never floated at all. Purely as a viewer, I love the Brent character and Rickys amazing at it. He will always make me laugh doing Brent. Do you know Love Actually was recently voted the nations favourite Christmas film? I did not. Thats nice. I like that film. The writing is absolutely beautiful. Some of Richard Curtiss best, I think. Youre all over our TVs at Christmas, arent you? Love Actually, The Office Christmas Special, Stick Man And Nativity [2009 film comedy], thats a good one. Youre Mr Christmas. A modern-day Bing Crosby or Val Doonican. The new Noel Edmonds.

Her first novel was 2012s The Spider Kings Daughter, which she began writing aged 17. Her follow-up is the powerful Welcome to Lagos. How did it feel having your first novel published aged 21? Theres an Igbo proverb: Whenever a person wakes up is his own morning. It was a brilliant, miraculous experience  but also really overwhelming, which meant my second book, Welcome to Lagos, was difficult to write. In my first novel there are only two main characters but this time I decided I wanted to write an ensemble novel but didnt know how, so I went through lots of drafts trying out viewpoints  I think the beauty of it is working it out yourself. What was the inspiration behind your second novel? I was going to write a novel about a teenager moving to England, which would have been incredibly autobiographical because I moved to England aged 14  but I wouldnt have been able to write it with detachment and humour. I do want to write about that one day. Then I had a dream about two soldiers. The impetus, the seed of the idea was that dream. Id also just read Amitav Ghoshs Sea of Poppies and I really liked the ensemble cast. In the acknowledgments you thank Lagos, city of my birth, my dreams, my frustrations, my imagination I started writing in primary school but Lagos wasnt a place where I set my fiction until I moved to England. When I went to Lagos to visit I began to question things and not just passively move through the city. I began to wonder a lot more. In Americanah [by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie] theres this idea that life is happening outside and then you get into the great outside and realise that life was happening in Lagos. I really love Lagos. At the same time, it is not a place you can romanticise  even from afar. Tell me about your research process... What happens in the book is a version of a real event  the Odi massacre in 1999. Interviews were very important to get the range of perspectives, from a woman who works for a charity with former militants in the Niger Delta to someone whod interacted with politicians. I visit Lagos a lot  my parents and brother live there. I refresh my sense of Lagos as often as possible. You powerfully explore faith in this novel Christianity is a big part of my life. One of my favourite CS Lewis books is Surprised By Joy. In my first year of university I was exploring and questioning my faith, and I wanted to capture that rumination in this novel. Faith isnt often explored in literary fiction from the inside although Marilynne Robinsons Home and Gilead are brilliant. How did you become interested in the theme of social divides? I knew from a young age about injustice and was aware of that aspect of Nigeria. Theres a baseline of opportunity that is not there for so many people. We went to a church where we had friends from across the social spectrum and we would go to each others houses and see that not everyone lived as we did. When we go back to the village where my father is from, I can see where he springs from  the roads are still not tarred, there isnt good access to healthcare and running water. They started off in a hut and that hut is still in the family compound  so theres no need for any airs and graces. Tell me about your literary influences. My dad was the oral storyteller and my mum bought us the books she read as a child, as she had a very colonial education  David Copperfield and Rebecca and Little Women. During the school lunch break, I felt transported to 19th-century England. I really feel that the Paris Review was like my creative writing master. It gave so much good advice  some of my favourites are Toni Morrisons and John Steinbecks interviews. I went through a phase where I would read one interview a day. I felt mentored by all these writers. Are you still a voracious reader? Yes. Ive just started The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt. Libraries are so miraculous. Its really sad that theyre closing libraries; its cutting off peoples opportunities. I know what it is to come from a culture where books are a luxury. In the library I was a member of in Nigeria you could only borrow one book at a time. Here, I discovered you could borrow 10 books at a time  riches! Wealth beyond measure!

The Bronts are, on the other hand, a phenomenal tale, often told, but never better than in this weeks offering from Sally Wainwright. It still staggers me, their story. Quite how one chilly Yorkshire parsonage bred three sisters who would upend the world of books remains a transformative tale. Lynne Reid Banks, in her book Dark Quartet, told it ridiculously well, but in Wainwrights version, To Walk Invisible, we get to see the cold red knees, the chilblains, the anger, the sorrow; we get to feel every icy gust of bitterness, every rare zephyr of hope. The sorrow is reserved mainly, of course, for brother Branwell, historically branded the reprobate boozer-loser flop of the clan. Adam Nagaitis bravely played him as a whey ugly nightmare with a ginger rats-nest of hair and whiskers: he played him, in fact, like a man with a constant pendulous drip at the end of his nose, waiting throughout to plop. If Branwell has been miserably served by history, its quite possibly justified: his antics, his debts, even his death, held his vaultingly more talented sisters in cruel thrall for most of their too-short lives. Chloe Pirrie as Emily bestrode the moors with seven-league boots and dominated every frame with her presence, her anger, her tenderness, as she did in the bittersweet 2013 movie Shell. Finn Atkins was Charlotte, all of a fiercely bespectacled five-foot-nought even in her Holly-Hobbie boots, but arguably the righteous steel and brains behind the outfit. The scenes at the London publishers, where she reluctantly reveals herself as Currer Bell, author of Jane Eyre, retain the ability to make one simultaneously laugh, cry and want to punch most men in the face. Wisely, Wainwright doesnt follow every single publication success. In lesser hands, we would have had obligatory acceptance letters for each sister  for Wuthering Heights, for Agnes Grey  to the backdrop of father Jonathan Pryce being all a-dither and Branwell spewing up drunken blood next door. Instead, and better, it is left to Charlotte to tremulously inform the father of the sisters financial independence, and reveal their noms de plume, by carrying through a few handsome bound volumes currently lionising literary London. Few of us surely get to see such quiet, shocked, heartbreaking pride in a fathers face. Its a tale that cannot be told often enough, and the utter standout in a week not devoid of sharp writing and acting. Sarah Phelps managed the near-impossible, to have me nurture a flicker of interest in Agatha Christie again. Her adaptation of The Witness for the Prosecution made me grimace for all the lost chances, those dire Ustinov-heavy glitterball farts of the 1970s, and remember that Christie, for all her absurd toxic frog intricacies and devilled snobberies, remains one of the tautest plotters ever. It was a dark and a nasty story, utterly watchable throughout if you could train your eyes to attain at least a modicum of movement inside one of the many fogs  but train them you should, not least for the quality of the acting. Andrea Riseborough, Kim Cattrall, David Haig  all sprinkled enigmatic magics. But Toby Joness final act had all the sublime bathos of the last 10 minutes of Death in Venice, and without Mahlers help. Give that man a sainthood. Delicious, a much-hyped Sky thing, had that grand Iain Glen, and that grand Emilia Fox, and Dawn French. Two were well cast. Ostensibly a tale about a successful chef whos having it all in gorgeous Cornish countryside and ruining it all with his penis, it was hampered somewhat by having Glen die at the end of the first episode, jumped from behind by his own cardiovascular system. Which sets the stage for a bonding between wife (Fox) and mistress (French, Glens ex-wife) to bravely reconcile each other to the tasks of a) forgiving each other, and b)&nbsp;making an even more glowing success of the restaurant. Those harsh first-world problems. Fortunately they are aided by a couple of children who promise great interest, and its perfectly filmed, and features lovely food and sea and sun. Ill forgive Fox anything pretty much, because of Silent Witness, but here she displays little of that coquetry, which is a shame. I should be able to forgive Dawn French more easily, but cant, because of The Vicar of Dibley, and because I find her credibility stretched as a louche Italian genius chef. Louche Italian genius female chefs, Ill tentatively warrant, dont keep the duvet chin-high when in the throes of&nbsp;passion. I wanted to like Maigrets Dead Man, wanted very much so to do, if only because it was ITVs one swipe at the Christmas piata. It was fine. Plot was fine, Rowan straight-batted it glumly fine, France of old looked, as it ever will, yearningly sexy. Essentially, however, it was, as it was always destined to be, a 40-minute Simenon delight crammed into two hours. I decided not to lazily write off Mrs Browns Boys. It remains absurdly successful, despite critics having generally trashed Brendan OCarrolls creation as demeaning, cheap, grotesque, simplistic to the point of catalepsy, savagely lacking in wit. So I watched it, and was surprised. Its all of these insults, yes, but the immersive experience is actually, shockingly, worse than expected. Sentimental to retching-point, homophobic, itch-lousy with single entendres, somehow managing to be both twee and vulgar, achingly unfunny, it made The Vicar of Dibley look like Father Ted. I suspect those of us in our high ivory metropolitan-elite towers (translation: humans who paid even nugatory attention to at least one class in school) missed a trick in 2016: the popularity of this shameless excrescence (I can now write it off after due diligence), which was voted by Radio Times readers the best sitcom of the 21st century, should have given a huge clue to the Brexit vote.','entertainment'),(118,'Ive never been much of a traditionalist, says Lop Ariyo. Whenever my mum and grandma see me doing stuff, theyre like, O-kaaay. She mimics a Nigerian woman looking askance at jollof rice made with grated cauliflower instead of actual rice, or fish and chips with cassava batter and spicy yams for chips. Its only once theyve tasted it that they say, OK, I see what youre doing. Now my mum gets a bit upset when I dont cook for her. As well she might. Last September, her daughter, who is 24, went from being an undergraduate with a food blog on the side, to an author whose first book, Hibiscus, out in June, may change the way we see African food in&nbsp;Britain. Ariyo was in her final year of a maths degree at Loughborough when she heard about a competition to find a cook who would break an African cuisine into the home kitchens of the UK. The competition, conceived by Red magazine and HarperCollins, was responding to a lack of diversity in British cookery writing. With encouragement from friends, Ariyo sent in an application, which she rushed home from her final exam to complete, and was called in a week later to cook alongside four other finalists representing North, East, South and Central Africa. Her freewheeling, boldly flavourful take on Nigerian cuisine won out and landed her a book deal with HarperCollins. My cooking is a union of English and Nigerian, Ariyo says when we meet near her family home in East Croydon. Like any born-and-bred south Londoner, she was exposed to a wide variety of flavours growing up: We did eat Nigerian food at home but not on a daily basis. It was when she went to boarding school in Lagos at the age of 11 that she got a proper taste for traditional dishes such as jollof rice, pounded yam and egusi soup. Returning to London two years later,&nbsp;she craved the food shed left behind and set about recreating it at home  but in a liberal fashion, improvising with whatever was available and sneaking in ideas from other cuisines. Purists such as her&nbsp;Nigerian&nbsp;grandmother may raise&nbsp;an&nbsp;eyebrow (at least initially) but&nbsp;her British friends were unanimous&nbsp;in their approval. As were the competition judges. She jumped out instantly, says Pip McCormac, lifestyle director at Red. Her recipes seemed really approachable  interesting and exciting but not beyond the realm of comprehension. Having tasted her sticky-sweet hibiscus chicken and that jollof cauliflower rice, which is intense, satisfying  and healthy without seeming virtuous  I heartily agree. For all its richness and mindboggling variety, African food has yet to cross over in the UK. With her lively, accessible take on Nigerian cuisine, Lop Ariyo could be the person to make it happen.

But his film-making debut, Lady Macbeth, out this spring, has nothing to do with the Bard. Featuring a mesmeric lead performance by Florence Pugh  the discovery of Carol Morleys film The Falling  its the 19th-century story of Katherine, a young married woman in the north of England who frees herself from the shackles of patriarchy in the most drastic way. Written by playwright Alice Birch, its adapted from Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, an 1860s Russian novel by Nikolai Leskov, which also inspired an opera by Shostakovich. The book is almost forgotten today but Oldroyd says: Its a cracking read. Were used to so much literature of that period where women either suffer in silence or run away. Katherine full-bloodedly takes her destiny in both hands. Its in the Jacobean tragic tradition. Despite being visibly exhausted from the films festival tour  hes been on the circuit since it debuted in Toronto in September  Oldroyd, 37, comes across as more buoyant, and boyish, than you expect from his early publicity photos, in which he sported a solemn Old Testament beard. This former theology student originally planned to become a priest but lost his faith at university in Durham and discovered theatre instead. He got into directing by accident, when taking part in a revue in Edinburgh: When you werent actually on stage, you were sitting back and telling your mates why they werent funny. That, I realised, was basically directing. He went on to be an assistant at theatres including the Almeida and the Barbican, where he worked on Deborah Warners epic Julius Caesar; had a directing residency at the Young Vic; and has travelled the world staging Beckett in Germany, Sartres Kean in Japan, baroque opera in Portugal and Donizetti at Sadlers Wells. Raised in Guildford, Oldroyd first tried his hand at film during a stint at art school, making video diaries on the short-lived Flip camera. But it took him a long time to evolve the rigorous style of Lady Macbeth. The first short I made was a scene from a play. I shot it in a field from one angle, because that was where I was used to sitting in a theatre. I thought, why doesnt this work? He became a lot more confident on his 2013 short Best, a five-minute two-hander that won the Sundance London Short Film Competition. Now he is poised for his first US project, an adaptation of Walter Mosleys novel The Man in My Basement. For the record, Oldroyd has done an actual Macbeth  a 2004 production starring Bertie Carvel.

Portuguese priests Rodrigues (Andrew Garfield) and Garupe (Adam Driver) are an army of two, embarking upon a Conradian mission to the ends of the Earth where Christians are forced to renounce their faith on pain of torture and death. We find our original nature in Japan, declares Ferreira (Liam Neeson), a Jesuit missionary who has reportedly gone native, turning his back on the cross and living as a Japanese with wife and family to match. Yet the young padres, proud and impetuous, refuse to believe that their former mentor has abandoned their God, or that Christianity cannot take root in this swamp of Japan. Christ is here, insists Rodrigues, I just cant hear&nbsp;him. Scorsese has been wrestling with Ends novel (first filmed by Masahiro Shinoda in 1971) for decades, and his labour of love has resulted in a film that is both loving and laborious. Like its subjects, Silence often stumbles as it strives to touch eternal truths, occasionally testing our patience. But its clearly Scorseses most personal work since Mean Streets, addressing issues of faith and doubt (alongside examinations of cultural and political monotheism) in a manner that has something of the quizzical passion of Dreyer and the earthy grit of Pasolini. Significantly, Scorseses films opens and closes to the sounds of nature, which, we are told, is too fundamental to Japanese culture to be usurped by alien Christianity. What little music there is remains as distant as the voice of God, drowned out by sotto voce conversations or the distant peal of a chapel bell. The visuals are painterly, with only a couple of energetic sweeps past the wooden slats of a prison cage reminding us of the frenzied urgency of Goodfellas or Casino. Instead, cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto conjures misty underworld vistas, Taiwan doubling handsomely for Japan in a series of arresting devotional tableaux. Even horrific scenes of Christians on poles being scalded with boiling water or drowned in a raging sea are shot with a peculiar serenity, the suffering somehow magnified by the placidity of the camera. In the lead roles, Garfield and Driver (respectively graduates of the Spider-Man and Star Wars franchises) bring mainstream appeal, although wobbly Portuguese accents threaten to undercut the solemnity of their English-language dialogue. With his angular features Driver catches the eye, but it is to Garfields leonine locks that Scorsese is drawn, the handsome face of Rodrigues evoking beatific images of Christ in whose likeness the padre presumes to style himself. No wonder he sees a vision of Jesus when gazing at his own reflection in a stream. As for Neeson, he played a Jesuit priest in The Mission, but his late-in-the-day reappearance here is more evocative of his turn as Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn in The Phantom Menace, reminding us that Kurosawa was always George Lucass guiding light. The real stars, however, are the Japanese cast, from Ysuke Kubozukas enigmatic wretch, Kichijiro, who becomes Rodriguess own personal Judas, to Yoshi Oidas devout elder Ichizo, to whose village these priests bring both salvation and suffering. As a smiling, silver-tongued interpreter, Tadanobu Asano is a superb foil to the inquisitor, Inoue, played with fly-swatting menace by a wheedling Issey Ogata. A scene in which Inoue appears to physically deflate is a masterclass in comedy acting, while his observations on the persistent love of an ugly woman are delivered in a manner that is amusing, insulting, and incisive in equal measure. The weight of your silence is terrible, Rodrigues whispers to God, and its a credit to Scorsese and co-writer Jay Cocks (his collaborator on The Age of Innocence and Gangs of New York) that this weight feels real and tangible. Silence may not possess the popular appeal of The Last Temptation of Christ or the breathtaking beauty of Kundun but it has the strength of its convictions, with Scorseses faith in the material sustaining the films soul even when its cinematic flesh is weak.','entertainment'),(121,'Much of the time, talented young architects are viewed in a particular way  diverting, promising but not really grown up, not to be entrusted with projects of any consequence. Young engineers are treated more seriously, but are assumed to have no creative spark. It is to escape such perceptions, and the limitations they set, that Maria Smith, architect, and Steve Webb and Andy Yates, engineers, have set up Interrobang, a practice dedicated to hybrid and anti-specialist thinking. An interrobang, if you didnt know, is a fusion of an exclamation point and a question mark. It suggests adventure and questioning, says&nbsp;Smith. Webb Yates Engineers worked on projects&nbsp;ranging from alterations to Gatwick&nbsp;and Heathrow airports to the Rain&nbsp;Room, a space full of falling water by the&nbsp;artists rAndom International at the Barbican arts centre. Maria Smith used to be&nbsp;half of Studio Weave, a practice known for&nbsp;delightful follies and temporary structures but in danger of being typecast as&nbsp;such. Smith and Webb are both eloquent and quick-thinking, with decided attitudes to what they do, and Smith was also the spectacular compere of something called Turncoats, a series of the least boring architectural events of recent years. Yates says less but, according to his partners, is the only one who really knows anything. Together, they can take on, from Smiths&nbsp;point of view, larger and more ambitious projects than I would have dared to dream. For Webb and Yates, collaboration means they can expand the imaginative dimension of their discipline. They all want to destroy the convention that an architects job is to design pretty things and an engineers is to make them happen. Their larger projects include the conversion of the famous art deco Hoover Building in west London into flats and continued (and&nbsp;increasingly interesting) work with&nbsp;airports. With a lifting bridge over a canal in Smethwick, west Midlands, they hope to achieve what Webb calls a victory of brain power over a mass of metal  they propose to add outriggers to ward off collisions by boats, which means the structure can be far more delicate than usual. They are designing a mews house in south London  typical young architects fare, but a project informed by an engineers feeling about materials. Webb talks of the utter stupidity of building in brickwork, on practical and environmental grounds, so the facade is a clever composition of tiles. They all like the intellectual rigour of engineering formulas that, like music and mathematics, create a framework that makes it impossible to bluff. Smith is studying for an engineering degree in her evenings and weekends and says she has started dreaming in equations. Outcomes of their combined thinking include Back to the Stone Age, an installation at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum that showed how thin stone slabs could be used to make a self-supporting floor that would be more efficient than concrete and better looking.

The project, an award-winning approach to help diagnose Alzheimers disease years before the telltale amyloid beta plaques appear in the brain, would be admirable in itself. But it is made even more impressive by the fact that Nithiyanandam is just 16. The Surrey schoolboy is no stranger to&nbsp;the press, having scooped headlines with his work, and theres already a hint of the showman about him. I had always wanted to do a research project really just because I thought doing something new would be quite cool, he says. At school you do experiments, but most of the time&nbsp;you are repeating experiments that have been done thousands of&nbsp;times before so it is difficult to get&nbsp;excited by it. It was some time before Nithiyanandam started to pursue his idea in earnest. Playing squash  he is an avid player  he broke his pelvis. Twice. It was a calamity, but also an opportunity. Laid off from sports he set to work contacting researchers in universities around the country for&nbsp;help with his project. There was a lot of rejection at first, he says. Eventually, a researcher from the University of Surrey offered&nbsp;to give him a hand, leading to the development of an antibody that could help detect early signs of&nbsp;Alzheimers disease. The work earned Nithiyanandam the $25,000 Scientific American Innovator award at the Google Science Fair last year. And theres more attention coming his way. His latest idea, in collaboration with researchers at Cambridge University, is aimed at making hard-to-treat breast cancers more receptive to common drugs. The work has already swept him to the final of the UKs National Science and Engineering Competition to be held in March 2017.

I was pretty determined I was going to study medicine at university, he says. Now I am not sure whether I&nbsp;want to go into medicine, research or computer science.

But supported by various public grants, it also functions, under his guidance, as a space for artists who want to learn more about making work with clay. Among its recent visitors was Anthea Hamilton, who made the prototype for the giant pair of buttocks that comprised her Turner prize-shortlisted Project for Door (After Gaetano Pesce) at Troy Town. Angell had hoped to lower that piece into the tank of his axolotl, whose environment, courtesy of the parade of artists coming through his door, changes every six months. But it exploded in the second firing, he says, with a mournful shake of his head. When Angell, who is 29, was at the Slade School of Art, working in clay wasnt an option available to students. I dont know if that pushed me to want to do it more, he says. But in my final year, it occurred to me that if you had the right set-up, you had this infallible way of making sculpture. He duly returned to his secondary school in Caterham, spent three weeks shadowing its ceramics technician and began the journey that eventually brought him here. The process is frustrating. Anyone can buy a bag of clay and a readymade glaze. But to do it properly, to make your own glazes as we do, you have to fail sometimes. That makes it a romantic, fatalistic thing. Youre almost working blind. Even the weather can affect a firing. He likes clays human scale, its lack of preciousness, the fact that it comes from the ground. But he hates to be called a ceramicist, not least because he also paints: Artist will do. Angell is a co-curator of a forthcoming exhibition at Tate St Ives: That Continuous Thing: Artists and the Ceramics Studio, 1920  Today. In the gallery hell oversee, he will show his own sculptures, historical pieces (one dates from 2000 BC) and a selection of work by artists who have visited Troy Town, as well as the tank that is home to his axolotl, complete with five rotating environments. Ive put so much work into it, he says. Its a feast of arrangements. Later in the year, he is to be an artist-in-residence, supported by the Tate, at the Leach Pottery in St Ives; looking further ahead, he will have solo shows at Glasgows Gallery of Modern Art and at Rob Tufnells new London space in a former ladies lavatory below Trafalgar Square.

She wasnt sure how to answer the question  but could not let it go. She practised with her dancing partner  who is also my fiance  and remembers a tango with lots of turns and spins  just like the unusual thriller she would go on to write. In Yesterday&nbsp;there are two sorts of people: those who can only remember what happened yesterday (monos) and superior mortals who can also remember the day before yesterday (duos). They all depend on their iDiaries in lieu of a past. When Claire, a trusting mono wife, learns that her duo husband, Mark, has a mistress whose body was found drowned in the river, she seeks answers. But what does she know? What can she hope to remember? The thriller is an intriguing, philosophical page-turner that concludes: We are all&nbsp;victims of the past we prefer. At 35, Yap is a phenomenon  her own past extraordinary. She looks like a dainty dancer and has been talent-scouted as a model. She grew up in a tiny house in Kuala Lumpur, the daughter of a banker  although the family was not well off.&nbsp; She affectionately recalls her fathers car, an old, dusty brown Datsun with holes in the floor. When I ask which past she prefers, it turns out to be a leading question. Yap studied biochemistry at Imperial College London and went on to become a researcher at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg. She then decided  extraordinarily  to jump tracks and became a Cambridge historian, researching the experiences of people in the east caught up in the second world war.

Ordinarily she does not accept friends on Facebook unless she knows them. But she made an exception for a woman who looked unusually sympathetic. She sent her a message: Have we met? The woman explained she had mistaken Yap for a former classmate from the Faber Academy. I reasoned that if someone thinks Im an alumna there, perhaps I should become one. Perhaps it is written.

But the action? Well, out of its time, that can seem more than a little off-key. Book (by brother-sister writing team Dorothy and Herbie Fields) and lyrics play around cultural assumptions about race and sex. They send up stereotypes, yet rely on audiences to appreciate them to get the joke. The joke wore thin. In 1999, a revised version excised much material featuring indigenous peoples. Its this reworking that director Paul Foster bases his production on. But any attempts to shoot stereotypes out of the show have missed. A subplot featuring showman Franks assistant, Dolly, inspiring the love of an indifferent man through her reaction to an imagined assault, is racially offensive and sexist. Time spent on Annies wilting longing for Frank, who does nothing dramatically to win her love, is disproportionate.Sharp sets (Laura Hopkins) and even sharper tunes (musical director Paul Herbert) and choreography (Alistair David) cant compensate for too little action and too much moping.

Weve perhaps been idealising it a little: I cant wait for this year to be over, people would say in response to every nightmare 2016 threw up, as if a mere change of digit would make all the difference. Still, if you fancy getting the new year off to a gentler start, you could do worse than Ethel &amp; Ernest (Universal, PG), Roger Mainwoods delicate, melancholic and adoringly realised animated adaptation of Raymond Briggss autobiographical graphic novel. Detailing the half-century-spanning relationship between Briggss salt-of-the-earth parents, from first date to last goodbye, Mainwood has fashioned a film in which every dramatic conflict lands like a goose down pillow. Its a very English, composed celebration of unconditional familial love and risks tipping into an overly romantic exercise in 20th-century nostalgia. Then again, as Ethel and Ernest, voiced by Brenda Blethyn and Jim Broadbent, repeatedly spar over their opposing politics, the film also plays as a wry blueprint of the Brexit voters rose-tinted England. Alternatively, if youre in the mood for quiet tenderness with a shade less cuteness, head over to Netflix, where Ira Sachss gorgeous teenage friendship study Little Men has skipped DVD to land on the streaming service, just in time to soothe some New Years Day hangovers. Exquisitely observed and immaculately cast, the film has an innate, unforced understanding of male adolescent breakability and bravado, embodied in the chalk-and-cheese pairing of withdrawn Jake (Theo Taplitz) and bolshy Tony (Michael Barbieri), who forge a deep bond as their parents fight a cross-class battle over Brooklyn property inheritance. The unhappy practicalities of the adults world is presented in stark contrast to the boys purer, sweeter search for their own identities. Sachs hints oh so subtly at the crises they might eventually face, without preserving their innocence in amber. Though the adult players are uniformly terrific, notably Chilean actress Paulina Garcia as Tonys hard-up seamstress mum, its Taplitzs aching vulnerability and Barbieris eccentric swagger that stick. As nasty and nihilistic as Sachss film is generous and humane, Paul Schraders Dog Eat Dog (Signature, 18) at least finds the veteran chronicler of societys seamier underside  an awfully long way from the insights of Taxi Driver  attacking lurid genre terrain with stomach-churning brio. You cant accuse the films neon-nightmare atmospherics of being half-hearted. The films hunger to shock, coming straight out of the gate with a grisly, drugged-up double murder, is so all-consuming that its sleazily tangled yarn, involving Nicolas Cage and a bug-eyed Willem Dafoe ineptly kidnapping an infant, seems an afterthought. Perhaps London Town (High Fliers, 15) could borrow some of its surplus bad attitude: Derrick Bortes peculiar musical semi-biopic welds a would-be gritty portrait of the Clash to a sentimental coming-of-age narrative to awkward effect. The rerelease of the week is a cracker. As taut and terse today as it must have seemed in 1953, Carol Reeds chiaroscuro espionage thriller The Man Between (Studiocanal, U) tends to get filed away in The Third Mans shadow, but deserves its own platform. Anchored by a typically suave, opaque James Mason, this morally complex tale of a former Nazi caught up, along with prim, innocent Claire Bloom, in a border-blurring Soviet-German abduction plot startles even today with the tougher twists of its melodrama.','entertainment'),(130,'In 1998, Yasmina Reza won a Laurence Olivier award for Art. The prize was for comedy. Reza, who is French, was surprised: I thought I had written a tragedy. But her drama pivots on a piece of modern art. Of course the British were going to think it a joke. Twenty years after the plays first London staging, attitudes have shifted. The white canvas over which three male friends fall out  is it beautiful? Is it just blank?  is less likely to be regarded as self-evidently the peak of pretentiousness. Still, derision usually trumps enthusiasm; a jeerer has an easier time being thought intelligent than an acclaimer. Rufus Sewell, sleek and poised as the man who buys the painting for 100,000, is at first greeted with superior titters. The sceptic Paul Ritter, a knot of irritation and scorn (all his limbs are crossed), seems to have won the day. But things change. Ritters contempt is so vituperative that it begins to look excessive. In a smart piece of visual argument, Hugh Vanstones lighting design throws a pattern of light on to one wall, as if through an unseen venetian blind. It looks like a rival painting; it suggests that white need not be plain or dull. The drama clicks around like a Rubiks Cube, each short scene offering a change of perspective. It is, of course, not really about painting but about friendship. Friendship that is destroyed as much by the way people speak as by what they do.

Yet later that same day Margaret Thatcher and her government decided not to take any action, against what ministers admitted was a ruthless regime, for fear of jeopardising lucrative exports to Iraq. In memos written two years after Saddam used mustard gas to slaughter more than 3,000 Kurds and only months before he marched into Kuwait, sparking war, newly released cabinet documents reveal that trade was still the uppermost concern for ministers. Even as the news of the hanging of the 31-year-old reporter was coming in, and despite public promises of firm action against what was clearly an increasingly dangerous dictator, cabinet ministers decided not to impose any sanctions. Trade or credit restrictions on Iraq would be ineffective in influencing the attitude of the Iraqi government and would inflict disproportionate damage on UK industry, Norman Lamont, a future chancellor but at that time the chief secretary to the Treasury, noted in a memo to foreign secretary Douglas Hurd, the files disclose. Opinion here has been deeply shocked by Iraqs behaviour, Hurd conceded in reply, before making clear he shared Lamonts concerns. We have a considerable commercial presence to protect in Iraq, he wrote. Lamont, now Lord Lamont of Lerwick, told the Observer that he had little memory of events from 27 years ago and thought it unlikely he would have had much input into any action taken by Britain against Saddams government. I have no recollection of being involved in this sad story, although I remember vividly being shocked by the tragic death of the young man, he said. There was some argument about how British was he  he did have an Iranian passport and that was the decisive thing: he wasnt a British citizen. Bazoft, an Iranian-born freelance reporter who held British residency, had been invited by Saddams government to visit Iraq with other journalists on a group trip to report on elections planned for the countrys Kurdish areas. It was his sixth visit to the country and he was keen to get a story that the Observer could use. The day he left, in September 1989, the Independent published a report about an explosion in August at the al-Hillah military complex south of Baghdad, suspected of modifying ballistic missiles and secretly manufacturing chemical weapons. There were rumours of hundreds of deaths. Bazoft asked a British nurse, Daphne Parish, to drive him out there: he took photographs and collected soil samples. He was arrested at Baghdad airport while waiting for his flight back to London. He was incarcerated at Abu Ghraib prison where he was kept in solitary confinement, starved and beaten. On 1 November he was placed in front of television cameras and confessed to being an Israeli agent. In 2003, the Observer tracked down Kadem Askar, the colonel in the Iraqi intelligence service who interrogated Bazoft. He admitted that he knew Bazoft was innocent, but that he was powerless to obstruct Saddams personal orders to have him convicted and executed. Within months of Bazofts death  his body was unceremoniously returned to his parents in the UK, turning up at Heathrow unannounced in a rough box  Saddam had sent his troops over the British-drawn border between Iraq and Kuwait in the invasion that sparked the Gulf war of 1990-91. The files from March 1990 were released as part of an initiative to gradually reduce the embargo on official government files from 30 years to 20, and are among Cabinet Office papers from 1989 and 1990 that are now available to the public at the National Archives in Kew, west London. They reveal that Charles Powell, Margaret Thatchers foreign affairs adviser, told the prime minister that there was little doubt there would be calls to suspend credit or impose trade restrictions on Saddams Iraq. He added: But we would not get international support for this and it would not actually achieve anything. Lamont agreed. Five days after Bazoft was hanged, Hurd warned: In the atmosphere brought about by our present difficulties, Iraq would see any action against credit as a further political response to Bazoft and would hit back hard. That would be bad for our wider commercial interests where our competitors would happily step in to take up our share of the market. The only action the Thatcher government took was not to subsidise a planned Birmingham trade mission to Iraq and avoid giving publicity to it, the hitherto classified documents show. During Bazoft and Parishs six-month imprisonment, smear stories and allegations against him appeared in several newspapers. Saddam said the two were British or Israeli spies. There has never been any evidence to support the allegation and, indeed, records uncovered in Baghdad in 2003 showed Saddam was well aware of this and simply wanted a punishment for Margaret Thatcher and to humiliate Britain. A one-day trial of the two was held in secret  in Arabic, which neither defendant understood  and without any defence. Parish was sentenced to 15 years in jail. Ten months after Bazofts death, she was allowed to return to the UK. Two backbench Tory MPs at the time repeated the notion that Bazoft was a spy, something picked up by newspapers, and there had long been suspicion that another story, revealing Bazoft had acquired a criminal record as a young man, had been leaked to discredit him. Certainly the government was aware of his past. The files at Kew contain a note sent by Sara Dent, private secretary to David Waddington, then home secretary, to Powell before Bazofts execution. You might wish to know, she said, that from our inquiries on his immigration files, Mr Bazoft, the Observer journalist who has been sentenced to death for spying in Iraq, has a criminal record in this country. Dent added: Although this has no bearing on his sentence in Iraq, it may be raised by the Iraqis or by the press. She noted that Bazoft had arrived in 1975 as a student. Four years later, he was in financial difficulties and his application for an extension to his stay was refused. He went into a building society, threatened to blow it up and demanded money from a cashier. He obtained 475  the amount he was in debt  and was arrested later that day. There was no bomb but he was sentenced to 18 months in prison. His deportation order was revoked after evidence emerged that Iran had issued a warrant for his arrest as an anti-revolutionary. His family were critics of Ayatollah Khomeini and he had been allowed to stay in the UK on an exceptional basis, Dent wrote. She ended her note to Powell by saying that the Home Office proposed not to volunteer this information but not deny it if it is raised with us. Tabloid newspapers gave prominent front-page coverage to Bazofts previous criminal conviction, while MPs Rupert Allason and Terry Dicks slated his character. Lord (Woodrow) Wyatt told his News of the World readers that Britain should start maximising trade and stop talking about Farzad Bazoft. Donald Trelford, then editor of the Observer, described the coverage of Bazofts imprisonment and execution by some editors on Fleet Street as persistently hostile. He said that, even 20 years on, it remained hard to contain ones anger  not just at the insane barbarity of Saddam, but at some Tory MPs and the parts of the British press that tried to pin the blame for his murder on poor Farzad himself. That the government of the day had consistently turned a blind eye to atrocities committed by Saddam became clear at the Scott arms-to-Iraq inquiry set up by John Major after the collapse of a trial of the directors of a Coventry-based machine tools firm, Matrix Churchill. It emerged during the trial that the directors were encouraged by MI5 and MI6 to spy on Saddams weapons programme when they visited Iraqi factories. Chemical weapons were known to have been used by Saddam during the Iran-Iraq war and, in March 1988, Iraqi warplanes attacked the Kurdish town of Halabja with chemical weapons, gassing between 3,000 and 5,000 men, women and children. At that time, the government had decided to relax controls on arms exports to Iraq. The files, released last week, include a document from 1989 in which the private secretary of the former Tory chancellor and foreign secretary, Geoffrey Howe, notes that Tariq Aziz, Saddams foreign minister, had promised that Iraq would not use chemical weapons in future. At the time ministers were planning to increase export credit guarantees for Iraq in the hope that British companies would win further contracts. Later that year, Hurd told Thatcher: The Iraqi regime is ruthless and disagreeable but its influence is growing following the Iran/Iraq conflict [which ended in 1988]. He warned of the dangers of taking measures that would damage British business. Also in the National Archives is a copy of a letter Thatcher sent to Saddam after the decision to release Parish. Dated 16 July 1990, it reads: I was very pleased to hear of your Excellencys decision to release Mrs Daphne Parish on humanitarian grounds  We have long-standing ties and there are many positive aspects to our relations on which we can build. A plaque and photograph remembering Farzad Bazoft remain in place in the Observer newsroom Iraq and Britain: a short history 1941 Iraq is reoccupied by Britain, less than a decade after gaining independence from British mandate. 1975 Iranian-born Farzad Bazoft, aged 16, comes to live in the UK with his parents. 1979 Saddam Hussein, of Iraqs Arab nationalist Baath party, becomes leader. 1980 Iran-Iraq war begins, ending in stalemate eight years later. 1981 Israeli air raid destroys nuclear reactor near Baghdad. 1988 Saddam attacks Kurdish town with poison gas. Thousands die. 1989 An explosion at al-Hillah, 60 miles from Baghdad, sparks rumours of secret military operations. In September, Iraq invites western journalists to cover elections in Kurdistan. Bazoft accepts, and enlists help from British nurse Daphne Parish to drive him to al-Hillah to investigate. They are both later arrested. 1990 Newspapers run stories based on a Tory MPs false claim that Bazoft was a spy. His criminal record is leaked to the press. On 15 March Bazoft is executed. Margaret Thatcher writes to Saddam saying she is horrified. On 2 August Iraq invades Kuwait, starting the first Gulf war. 1991 Iraq withdraws from Kuwait and is subjected to weapons inspections. A brutal crackdown on Kurdish and southern Shia rebellions begins. Parish is released and allowed to return to the UK. 2002 Tony Blair publishes dodgy dossier into Iraqs military capability. 2003 US-led invasion topples Saddams regime. Documents found in Baghdad show Saddam knew Bazoft was not a spy but killed him to humiliate Britain.','politics'),(134,'This time last year, I looked at what publishers had planned for 2016 and reached, metaphorically speaking, for my souwester: nature books were then coming at us in what I can only describe as a deluge. This spring, however, the shelves reflect a rather more terrifying kind of inclement weather. The world being in crisis, we are about to be inundated with books that worry away at global rage, the new populism, and the effect of the internet on both. Among the titles on this rocky terrain are Pankaj Mishras Age of Anger: A History of the Present (Allen Lane), in which the author attempts to trace the tangled roots of the many hatreds and nationalisms currently sweeping the planet; Jamie Bartletts Radicals (William Heinemann), which examines the motivations and methods of the followers of, among others, Isis, Beppe Grillo and Jeremy Corbyn; Daniel Levins Nothing But a Circus: Misadventures Among the Powerful (Allen Lane), an anthropological portrait of unscrupulous global elites by one with first-hand experience of how they work; and Jonathan Taplins Move Fast and Break Things: How Facebook, Google and Amazon Have Cornered Culture and What It Means for All of Us (Macmillan), a manual that will probably not, I hazard a guess, tell us anything terribly happy-making about our screen lives. Its possible, though, that in the UK, Sayeeda Warsis The Enemy Within: A Tale of Muslim Britain (Allen Lane) may end up causing more of a stir than all of them put together, given her vexed relationship with the Conservatives, the party of which she was once vice-chair. Warsi, her publisher promises, unpicks the challenges ahead for British Muslims with brutal honesty. Memoir continues to be important  perhaps too important?  to publishers, who will doubtless have been encouraged by the way it dominated the nonfiction prize shortlists in 2016, all but pushing aside traditional biography. The one Im looking forward to more than any other is The Rules Do Not Apply by Ariel Levy (Fleet), which tells the story of how its journalist author built a successful and unconventional (by some standards) life, only to watch it crumble to dust. Levy is a fantastic writer and reporter, cool-headed, witty and entirely without self-pity, and this chronicle of what it means to be a woman who is free to do as she chooses comes with advance praise from, among others, Lena Dunham and Alison Bechdel. Ive also heard good things about Sam Millers Fathers (Cape), which delicately unpicks a family mystery no one ever spoke about (he is the son of Karl Miller, the influential founding editor of the London Review of Books). And you should certainly make space in your reading life  sorry as I am to return so soon to the world in crisis  for The Raqqa Diaries: Escape from Islamic State by Samer (Hutchinson). These dispatches began as broadcasts on Radio 4s Today programme, after reporter Mike Thomson and the BBCs Arabic service found a young man who was willing to risk his life to tell the world what was happening in his city (part of a small anti-Isis activist group, the diaries were encrypted and sent to a third country before being translated). Horrifying, and unmissable. If youre chasing major biographies this spring, the pickings are relatively slim. Still, in April, Thomas Dilworths long-awaited account of the life and work of the modernist poet and artist David Jones will be published, some 30 years after it was first commissioned. Jones is not an easy subject. Shy and reclusive, he remains far less well known and celebrated than his greatest admirers (TS Eliot most famously, but also Kenneth Clark, Dylan Thomas and Igor Stravinsky). But perhaps the lavishly illustrated and wonderfully well written David Jones: Engraver, Soldier, Painter, Poet (Cape) will go some way towards correcting this. Dilworth is that rare thing: a scholar who has the capacity for great clarity. Also worth a look is The Surreal Life of Leonora Carrington (Virago) by Joanna Moorhead. Carrington was Moorheads fathers cousin, and her narrative is informed by the friendship they established over pizza and tequila in the years before the artists death in 2011. The Good Bohemian (Bloomsbury) is a new collection of letters by Ida John, the first wife of the artist Augustus John, edited by her granddaughter, Rebecca John, and Augustus Johns biographer, Michael Holroyd; among the stories it tells is of Idas remarkable acceptance of her husbands new lover, Dorelia, with whom she would share her life and home until her death at the age of just 30 from puerperal fever. The Essential Paradise Lost (Faber), John Careys spirited attempt to bring readers back to John Milton, combines a shorter version of his greatest poem with new insights into his inspirations and characters, while The Disappearance of mile Zola: Love, Literature and the Dreyfus Case (Faber) is Michael Rosens (rumoured to be gripping) account of the novelists exile in London following the publication of his open letter, Jaccuse. By now you may be wondering where to go in search of light relief. Im avid to tuck into food historian Annie Grays The Greedy Queen: Eating with Victoria (Profile), a tale of the royal kitchens in the 19th century and their lasting influence on our own groaning tables. (Will there be cake? Yes, there will.) Or what about Emergency Admissions (Fourth Estate) by Kit Wharton? Someone who has read this book  its by a former journalist who now works as an ambulance driver, and comes with the full range of disgusting bodily discharges  told me that while it can be both sad and enraging, more often it is just very, very funny.

First, theres Michael Chabons Moonglow (Fourth Estate). Taking in radicalism and rocket science, this is a wildly inventive and often very funny novel, and such a relief after its tedious predecessor, Telegraph Avenue. Speaking of tedious, Jonathan Lethems career has never quite regained the heights of Motherless Brooklyn and The Fortress of Solitude. The Blot (Jonathan Cape), out in February, tells of a telepathic backgammon shark with a brain tumour. Its a return to form, absurd and digressive in a way that makes clear Lethems debt to Thomas Pynchon. Finally, and most surprisingly, theres Paul Austers 4321 (Faber). Auster is 70 in 2017, which shocked me rather  I still think of him as a sprightly iconoclast. His new novel is so much better than anything since The Music of Chance, you wonder if it can really be by the same author as Invisible or Oracle Night. This meticulously plotted book weaves four possible stories out of the life of one man  Ferguson  who makes his way through the second half of the 20th century being buffeted by forces political and personal. Think a postmodern take on Kate Atkinsons Life After Life. Ones heart goes out to the contemporary American novelist, for whom daily reality seems to outstrip the reach of both satire and dystopia. All the more impressive that a debutant, Nathan Hill, with his scintillating The Nix (Picador), has given us a character who comes close to out-Trumping Trump. Sheldon Packer is a bilious demagogue, just one of the many pleasures of this engaging story of a mother and son whose private travails become front-page news. Other first novels worth looking out for are Sympathy (One) by Olivia Sudjic, the best fictional account Ive read of the way the internet has shaped our inner lives. A literary thriller that confirms the arrival of a major new talent. Theres also The Clocks in This House All Tell Different Times (Salt) by Xan Brooks  a fairytale wrapped within a historical novel, its as quixotic and dreamlike as Ishiguros The Buried Giant. Elif Batumans memoir of a life in love with Russian literature, The Possessed, was stunning and her first novel, The Idiot (Cape), is just as good  a moving, continent-hopping coming-of-age story. Brian Catlings The Vorrh blew me away (along with my ideas of what fantasy novels should do) when it came out in 2012. Ive just finished the second of the trilogy  The Erstwhile (Coronet)  and its even better. Set in London, Germany and Africa, the book features William Blake alongside its cast of monsters and adventurers. These are luminous and visionary novels  Gormenghast reimagined by Alan Moore on opium. Speaking of trilogies, Anthony Quinns Eureka (Cape), out in July, concludes the series that started with Curtain Call and last years excellent Freya. Mixing the Beatles, Antonioni and Henry James, its a joyful hymn to the 1960s. Last years procession of sucker-punches  Bowie (whump!), Brexit (pow!), Prince (argh!), Trump (clang!)  made us all feel like characters in a Greek tragedy, and so we should not be surprised that authors have turned to Sophocles and Aeschylus to explain the way we live now. Kamila Shamsies Home Fire (Bloomsbury) retells Antigone against the backdrop of contemporary London, weaving a poignant and timely tale of two British Muslim families with differing ideas about loyalty to the state. Natalie Haynes also takes on Sophocles in her vivid and affecting second novel, The Children of Jocasta (Mantle). Colm Tibn, meanwhile, in House of Names (Viking), steps into the voice of Clytemnestra. This is a quite breathtaking work of fiction  every bit as powerful as Madeleine Millers Song of Achilles. In translation, theres the second novel from Laurent Binet, whose HHhH, published in 2010, is one of my favourite books. The Seventh Function of Language (Harvill Secker), again translated by the superb Sam Taylor, is a rollicking crime caper about the death of Roland Barthes. It had me rolling on the floor of the Paris Metro when I read it last year. Theres also The Sad Part Was (Tilted Axis) by Prabda Yoon, translated by Mui Poopoksakul. These are evocative, erudite and often very funny stories of Bangkok life. This years historical fiction highlights have about them a distinctly macabre flavour, with Sarah Schmidts gory and gripping debut See What I Have Done (Tinder Press) reimagining the crimes of Lizzie Borden. Ben Myerss The Gallows Pole (Bluemoose) may well turn out to be 2017s His Bloody Project. Its a windswept, brutal tale of 18th-century Yorkshire told in starkly beautiful prose. Theres also The Fatal Tree (Sceptre) by Jake Arnott. The fictional memoir of gangster Edgeworth Bess, this is a work of dazzling imagination and linguistic inventiveness. More excitement comes from the prospect of a second novel from Arundhati Roy. I was only semi-pubescent when the last one was published, and The Ministry of Utmost Happiness (Hamish Hamilton) is apparently worth the long wait. Theres also a new novel from the absurdly gifted Jon McGregor, seven years after the Impac-winning Even the Dogs. Reservoir 13 (Fourth Estate) is haunting and heartbreaking, the tale of a disappearance and its aftermath  his best yet. Edward Docxs Let Go My Hand (Picador) tells the deeply tender story of a son, his dying father, and a journey they must take together. You should look out for three powerful novels of married life  Amanda Craigs sharply satirical The Lie of the Land (Little, Brown); Gwendoline Rileys devastating and stylish First Love (Granta); and KatieKitamuras electrifying A Separation (Clerkenwell Press), which I&nbsp;read in one&nbsp;breathless sitting. Finally, three short story collections that catch the eye. Tessa Hadleys Bad Dreams (Cape) is typically lapidary, full of the most gorgeous sentences and brilliant observations. Adam ORiordans Burning Ground, (Bloomsbury), a collection of stories set in California, is wonderfully lyrical and bittersweet. Then theres Pulitzer-winner Viet Thanh Nguyens The Refugees, whose eight heart-wrenching and hopeful stories ought to be required reading for every politician in this era of wall-building and xenophobia.

Its past is wrapped up with that of the country itself. Now it somehow has to represent the complex and precarious history of Estonia, in a fraught present, with a combination of pride and sensitivity. For a European country to build a national museum at this moment, when nationalism is taking new and unpredictable forms, is perilous. If Russia were to invent such a thing now, it would look like another form of aggressive aggrandisement; if Britain, an episode of querulous post-Brexit blue-passport patriotism; if Germany, it would raise issues too agonising for a single museum to handle. Estonia, a country of 1.3 million, whose two periods of independence  between the wars and since 1991  add up to less than 50 years, and which still has grounds to be nervous of its neighbour Russia, has reason to define and assert itself with a museum, but it also has to tread cautiously. The idea of a national museum has been linked to the idea of Estonian independence for more than a century, ever since a group of nationalist-minded intellectuals decided to create such a thing. Since then the fluctuating fortunes of independence, war and occupation have caused the collections to be housed in different places, to be dispersed and reassembled. Under postwar Soviet occupation the contents and concept of the museum were threatened. In the late 80s the call to reinstate the museum was part of a new campaign for freedom. The new 70m building is the fulfilment of this desire, after many years of debate and interruptions since Estonia won back independence in 1991. Its location, according to the usual logic of maximising visitor numbers, is near-suicidal. It is not in the capital Tallinn but 190km away in the second city, Tartu (population 100,000), and not precisely there either but a 2km journey through sometimes brutal weather from the centre. But what the site lacks in accessibility it makes up for in significance: it includes the remains of a manor house, wrecked in 1944, in which the collections were housed between the wars. It also includes an airstrip, with associated earthworks for protecting warplanes, used by the Soviet military. With the aircraft roaring over the ancient university town of Tartu, it was a symbol of the hatefulness of occupation. The design of the building is the result of a competition held in 2005 and won by a multinational trio of young architects, the Italian-Israeli Dan Dorell, the French-Lebanese Lina Ghotmeh and the Japanese Tsuyoshi Tane, who were working in the London offices of David Adjaye and Norman Foster and sacrificing sleep and leisure to work on their entry in their spare time. Entrants could choose a site somewhere in the grounds of the old manor house. DGT (as the three called themselves once they became an architectural practice) selected a location at the end of the old runway. For the architects it was important not to erase the past  that as Dorell says, the museum could be mature enough to get over the trauma. The building, 355m long, projects the straight lines of the runway back towards the city. Its glass sides, imprinted with a white pattern, are designed to reflect surrounding trees and snow. Its roof gradually slopes upwards until it forms a grand portico at the main entrance. At one point the building bridges a lake, one of a sequence that originated in the manor houses landscape garden. Courtyards puncture the block, introducing fragments of nature. The interior is spacious and airy, with views to the outside seen through layers of glass. It was a controversial choice, to draw attention to the most negative part of the sites history. There were also strong lobbies for placing the museum somewhere else entirely, in the centre of Tartu or in Tallinn. The European Union, not liking the remote location, refused to contribute to its cost. There were objections to the appointment of foreign architects for this national emblem. The 2008 crash slowed things down. For all these reasons it took more than a decade for the designs to be realised, during which time DGT set up their office and based themselves in Paris, all the time battling to realise what would be a spectacular first project for any practice, working unpaid when necessary  we were ready for anything to make this happen. They credit the miracle of its realisation to its former director Krista Aru  to the strength of that woman  and to our belief. The outcome is a contrasting combination of national and international, folkloric and modern, charged and cool. The building is glassy, geometric, hard-surfaced, straight-lined. The contents tend to be handmade, everyday, sometimes rough-hewn, often in the countrys most abundant material, which is wood. The aim of the museum is not to record grand historical events so much as the lives that ordinary people lived through them. Nor is it just about exhibits  music and drama are held there, such that the museum becomes in effect a very large village hall. The origins of the collection are in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when 1,400 volunteers toured the towns and villages of the not-yet-recognised country to gather texts and artefacts of popular folklore. To these have been added mementoes of lives since then, through the turbulence of the 20th century. There are for example the charms, pagan in origin, that peasants used to bring luck to their fields centuries after the country was supposedly Christianised. There are 2,600 ornamental wooden beer tankards, large and individually personalised. There are medals won by pilots, an art deco radio, rusted military material from the airfield, early photographs of cautiously squinting country people. Struggles against foreign rule  the country has at different times been run by Swedes, Germans and Russians  are there, but mostly discreetly. There is a video of the Baltic Way of 1989, in which 2 million people joined hands across the three Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. There is a bookcase that reconstructs the way in which, under the Soviets, cohesion came from oppression: restricted in many ways, Estonians turned to discussions of literature, in turn limited by the small range of titles available, which were mostly translations of classics such as Dickens. There is a lawnmower from a time when it was impossible to buy such a machine, a little monument of persistence and ingenuity, handmade out of a pushchair, a washing machine motor and a bucket. The patriotism is a little more overt in a reverential room in which the first Estonian flag, made by students in the late 19th century and banned in Soviet times, is displayed. There are also large basement galleries dedicated to the peoples deep in Russia who speak languages in the same Finno-Ugric group as Estonian, a partly conjectural display of festivals and reconstructed cabins. This is tricky stuff, not least for the large Russian minority within Estonia, but it is mostly negotiated with tact. The museum could be both triumphalist and sentimental, but it is neither. At their best the displays are touching and revealing rather than heroic. The architecture plays its part by combining the drama of its setting and a striking overall form with a deadpan delivery. Views are offered of the ruin and of the landscape, downward to water and upward to sky, and long perspectives to the runway, but without exclamation marks. The temptation to invent a style somehow Baltic-looking has been avoided. If these are good instincts they also mean that the building, contents and setting will take some getting used to each other. It is a long way from the contemporary sharpness of the glass to a wooden beer tankard, a distance that the designers of the exhibition installations have tried too hard and intrusively to close. The surrounding landscape, much of which had to be dug up to remove contamination left by the airbase, is still raw. The museum is a project unlikely as the lawnmower, or indeed Estonia itself, which relies on passion for the theme to override disadvantages of location. So far it seems to be working, with about 60,000 visitors in each of its first two months. It is also a work in progress, not least because the museum is still inviting Estonians to contribute their personal objects. This is as it should be, as identity is something that never stands still.','business'),(137,'Something suitably cheerful and timelessly weird to see the new year in. All true jazz lovers know about Slim, the laid-back jester of the swing and bebop eras.

His playing was ramshackle, but somehow never wrong, and his charm invincible.

Far from home, she would decide which of two suitors to marry. Bichan retraced her grandmothers journey and captures its emotional arc on an elegant album of chamber folk, with her fiddle supported by piano, cello and bass.

The time between Christmas and new year (Boxing Week? Twixtmas? Resolution Run-Up? Slobba-lobba-ding-dong?) is always an odd one for broadcasters. They get as many shows prerecorded as possible, and then bus in the second-in-commands for news. Everythings slightly skew-whiff. Evidence: on Friday, Johnnie Walker had a special show. Instead of his Sounds of the Seventies or even a regular Johnnie Walker Meets he had the sound of Peter Kay, as he and Kay drove around Bolton and Manchester in Kays car, listening to tracks that each had chosen. I tuned in with trepidation. Peter Kay only agrees to go on TV or radio if he can take over. Hes a broadcast bully, a chat-show terrorist, taking everyone hostage from host to guests to audience. Though I enjoy his standup (if Michael McIntyre has his finger on the pulse of the suburban south, Kay knows what makes northerners howl), I cant watch him on live TV. He makes everything about him. Its maddening. And at the beginning of the programme he did exactly this, hogging the mic as though it were his show rather than Walkers. Plus, his hijack clearly began before they had even started recording, when theyd met at Piccadilly station and Kay shouted at a punter that Walker was his long-lost dad and hed just found out he was adopted. Funny, of course but no one else had a choice. Nobody ever does with Kay. Gradually, though, Kay let Walker speak and managed to get some lovely stuff from the long-time music fan, especially about the Beatles and being a DJ in San Francisco when the Sex Pistols played their last gig. Of seeing the Beatles in 1963, on a Saturday night in Handsworth, Walker said: They inspired me to do something different. Four blokes who made this amazing music, had this great sense of humour, and the world was going nuts. They played two gigs in one night It was the freedom and potential of being young and being yourself and really having a go at something. Lovely stuff from him, and in the end from Kay too. Music has a way of unwinding people into revealing themselves, and a relaxed Kay was far more charming than his usual hyperactive show-off. Plus, he played Frank Wilsons Do I Love You (Indeed I Do), so we can forgive him a lot. Another northern comedian, Victoria Wood, managed to always be gracious, and her 2007 Desert Island Discs  rebroadcast on Christmas Day as part of the Absent Friends strand  was lovely to hear. Anyone who chooses Randy Newmans Marie and the Doobie Brothers What a Fool Believes knows what music can do to your heart, and this show, her second Desert Island Discs appearance, is one I remember very clearly. Wood was so honest about her loneliness as a child, and the devastation of her marriage break-up; she let you in, and it made you love her more. No way would Peter Kay relinquish control enough to do that. Finally, if youre feeling robust during this strange week, then try Love + Radios latest, Blink Once for Yes. Be warned: its heavy stuff. An accident, a family tragedy. Nothing we havent heard before, but presented and crafted by John Fecile, one of the family members, into an intensely compelling real-life story.

For me, the most striking lesson was the way it demonstrated how the internet has changed democratic politics. While there is no single, overarching explanation for Donald Trumps election, his ascendancy would have been unthinkable in a pre-internet age, for two reasons. The first is that much of Trumps campaign rhetoric would never have got past the editorial gatekeepers of an earlier era  the TV network owners and controllers, the editors of powerful print media and the Federal Communications Commission with its fairness doctrine (which required holders of broadcast licences to present controversial issues of public importance and to do so in a manner that was, in the Commissions view, honest, equitable and balanced). The second reason is that in the pre-internet era, the multitudes of Trumps vigorous, engaged and angry supporters would have had little option but to fume impotently in whatever local arenas they inhabited. It would have been difficult, if not impossible, for them to hook up with millions of like-minded souls to crowdsource their indignation and their enthusiasm for the candidate. So I think we can say that while the net may not have been a sufficient condition for Trumps victory, it was definitely a necessary one. Most commentators, hypnotised by Trumps mastery of Twitter and the prevalence of fake news on Facebook, attributed this entirely to social media. But again, this was an overly simplistic view, for it turns out that there was a deep structure underpinning most of what went on in social media and it needed some fairly intensive network analysis to reveal it. Much of the heavy lifting in this regard was done by Jonathan Albright, an academic at Elon University, a private liberal arts college in North Carolina, who, in a series of remarkable blog posts, explored the vast ecosystem of far-right websites that have been proliferating on the web for years. Professor Albrights central idea is that journalistic analysis of social media activity (for example, plotting millions of Facebook reactions to a fake news story or hashtag-surfing social media) doesnt get us very far. What we need to understand is the online infrastructure that feeds the frenzy and that is what he set out to map. What emerges from his work is a fascinating picture of what is effectively a rightwing propaganda machine built from more than 300 fake news sites and containing something like 1.3m hyperlink connections. Albright also mapped the hidden online trackers hosted by these sites. This is similar to the tracking ecosystem behind most commercial websites. But in the rightwing case, these trackers are coming away with information not about consumption preferences but about the possible political or ideological predilections of site visitors. Ones first reaction to Professor Albrights maps, after the sharp intake of breath at the scale and intensity of the online activity implied by them, is to ask what would the comparable leftwing ecosystem be like? His tentative answer is that it appears to be significantly smaller and much less interconnected than the alt-right ecosystem. Which is where the really interesting questions begin. Why is the political extreme right so established and dominant on the net? The answer is probably that its members have been effectively excluded from mainstream political discourse for a long time. So the internet, with its intrinsic permissiveness, was, for them, the only available option. (Indeed, it still is.) And they went for it. Why have they been such effective exploiters of the technology? Among the possible reasons are: the fact that radicals and insurgents intuitively understand the power of simple messages; they are motivated and driven, are less scrupulous about the stories they tell and good at making the facts fit the narrative rather than the other way round. They understand&nbsp;propaganda, in other words. But their main advantage may be that they have understood the affordances of cyberspace better than most of their liberal opponents, in particular the way in which its undermining of traditional institutions has opened up a world in which people find it easy to discover information that supports rather than challenges their beliefs. In that sense, the far right may have taken on board Hannah Arendts observation about the ideal target for totalitarian propaganda being people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction, true and false, no longer exists. So it was quite a year. Lets hope that this one is better.','tech'),(143,'In 2009 veteran documentarian Frederick Wiseman released La Danse, an exhaustive, austere film, which explored the Paris Opera Ballet.

If Wisemans restrained, thoughtful approach echoes the cautious atmosphere of the Ballet as it was, this stylish, dynamic picture captures the new energy that Millepied injected into this august organisation.

He sports dark stubble that blurs the chiselled jaw that matches his sportmans physique. Though instantly recognisable, he still rises from the sofa and offers a firm handshake and an unnecessary but polite, Hi, Im Ben. While his blockbuster films  such as Gone Girl and Argo (which he also directed)  have been watched by millions, his American TV appearances are also worth searching out. He sounds off on the HBO sports show Any Given Wednesday, effing and blinding like a bricklayer whos just dropped a bag of cement on his toe. Hes equally at home slugging it out round for round with intellectuals and politicos on the current affairs programme Real Time. Hes as passionate about the injustice meted out to one of his favourite football players as he is about comments that veer close to Islamophobia. I love a good debate and I get very energised by it, he says. On Real Time, I think people could tell I had a genuine emotional response because I strongly believe that no one should be stereotyped on the basis of their race or religion. Its one of the most fundamental tenets of liberal thought. Affleck grew up in a tough Boston neighbourhood and if someone picks a fight, hes not about to back down. You cant help thinking hed have a head start if he ever thought of going into the pugilistic world of American politics. But I really wouldnt want to, he says. Its not because I think being a public servant wouldnt be satisfying, but its become a pure money-raising exercise from beginning to end. Its small talk with people who you want to squeeze money out of. Its sleazy. You have to have a certain tolerance to that kind of schmooze that I dont have. Talking of world-class schmoozing, its just weeks before Trumps inauguration and Affleck is still trying to come to terms with his victory. He saw the signs in the US and the UK of populism on the rise. I spent five months in London [last year] and I have to say the Brexit vote smacked of the same kinds of things I heard here. People whose overarching political agenda is that immigrants are ruining things for us or immigrants are getting one over on us somehow, taking advantage. In London, its Polish people and here its Mexican Americans. I still believe in the basic goodness of people, but that doesnt mean we arent going through a spell where were in thrall to some ugly ideas and ugly notions. Its unlikely that an invite to the Trump White House will be landing on to his doormat anytime soon. I met him once at a Fashion Week event in Milan. You knew you were at a cheesy party if Donald Trump was there. He would kind of trawl around them. He was famous for only granting permission for films to shoot on his real estate locations if they put him in as a cameo. The director Marty Brest told me hed had to create a whole hand-shaking scene in Scent of a Woman where Trump comes out of the door and goes, Hey! Donald Trump, nice to meet you, as he bumps into Al Pacino. The ego was there a long time ago. Afflecks own ego is more than satisfied with acting and directing. With Live by Night, based on a Dennis Lehane novel, he does both. He plays Joe Coughlin, a corrupt policemans son who runs with the bad boys in 1920s Prohibition Boston and falls for the girlfriend of his ruthless boss. When the boss finds out about their affair, Coughlin is lucky to escape with his life. He moves up the ranks with a rival mob, overseeing a rum-running operation. Affleck describes the movie as a love letter to the gangster flicks of the 1930s and 40s, and with a reported budget of $65m its his biggest movie to date. The era of fedora hats, braces and brogues fits Afflecks classic matinee idol good looks, too. The first act is, once again, set in Boston just like two of his earlier films as a director, Gone Baby Gone and The Town. I think you recognise whats closest to home, he says. Wherever you were raised and formed your primary attachments and learned about life, thats the world thats most accessible to you. Dennis really gets Boston. He infuses his story with a love for the place, even if parts of it arent that lovable. Although Affleck was born in California, his family moved to Cambridge on the outskirts of Boston when he was two. His father, Timothy, went from one job to the next  bartender, mechanic, janitor and, later, after battling alcoholism, an addiction counsellor. His mother, Chris, was a teacher. They separated when he was 12. I guess contemporary helicopter parents would be aghast at our level of supervision, but it wasnt bad. There were scary kids and people that youd want to stay away from, but I tried to make people laugh and make friends. His best friend, then and now, was Damon, two years older, who lived a few blocks away. They began acting at high school and as teenagers would go to auditions together. Damon went to Harvard and Affleck to the University of Vermont, but both dropped out and headed to Los Angeles to live the dream. It was me, Matt, my brother Casey and a bunch of friends from Boston  all of them were trying to make it in some capacity or other. It was a time to experiment, to go to auditions and try stuff. And part of what we revelled in was the absurd level of frustration that we went through and the ridiculous hoops we had to jump through. Those years were wonderful  they were great, formative, blissful, fun, free years. It was during those struggling years that he made his low-budget directorial debut in the insanely titled I Killed My Lesbian Wife, Hung Her on a Meathook, and Now I Have a Three Picture Deal at Disney. Yeah, the title is the best thing about it, he says. Its about how we sometimes forgive the lunatic behaviour of artists and call it eccentricity. I was trying to make it as an actor and hearing stories of how so and so was doing this or that guy has this outrageous technique. And I remember thinking, What bullshit. Just because this guys on some crazy diet doesnt make him talented. The work itself is what matters. Sound advice that he, perhaps, should have remembered. In the early 2000s he made a series of disastrous film choices including Michael Bays overblown Pearl Harbor and the dreadful weepie Jersey Girl. At the same time, he became engaged to Jennifer Lopez and there were reports of drinking, gambling and a spell in rehab. Id always had a strong idea about my values and the direction I wanted to be headed in, then I ran into getting famous and it totally spun me around and I flailed around for a few years. When youre a young man in your 20s, part of that is making mistakes and learning from them. I just made those in front of everybody, rather than privately. Theres stuff I look back on and kind of cringe at but I always tried to treat other people well. My parents imbued that in me and the mistakes I made were mostly just of the embarrassing kind. The upswing in his professional fortunes coincided with the start of his relationship with the actress Jennifer Garner, the mother of his three children, Violet, 11, Seraphina, 7, and Sam, 4. I think becoming a father makes you see the world differently and its good. In 2015, he and Garner, his wife of 10 years, announced they were separating, although both insist they remain on good terms, despite the tabloid headlines claiming the split involved the couples nanny. The poster for Live by Night has the tag line the American dream comes at a price. He agrees its pertinent to his own life. Absolutely. Ive been lucky. Ive had my wildest dreams come true, but the price is the Faustian exchange you make where your identity is not your own. You become a public figure and it changes all the rules,. The press can become invasive and dishonest, and you have to put up with inconvenient stuff like that. Im at peace with paying my own price, what Im not at peace with is when it invades on my kids space and time. They didnt make any bargains. I try to shelter them as best I can. Thats my only real gripe. Essentially, he insists, hes the person he was before he won his Oscar for the Good Will Hunting script back in 1998. He credits Robin Williams with getting the film into production. Most people cant point to the moment that changed their life in such a dramatic way, but I can. It was the moment that Robin decided to take a flyer on that movie. Ill always feel a huge debt to him although now Ill never get to repay it. Williams, who had dementia, took his own life in 2014. Its one of these incredibly horrible diseases that destroys the mind and that was especially cruel to a guy like Robin who was always so brilliant and quick witted. And on a totally selfish level, hes the reason why I got successful in this business. If Robin hadnt done Good Will Hunting, Matt and I would still be sitting there today talking about how we could update that script. Instead, theyre sitting in their office, talking about other peoples scripts and their own film projects. Though the batman costume in the foyer is from Afflecks caped crusader in Zack Snyders messy Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, word is that he will get to direct his own superhero movie, tentatively titled The Batman. Thats the idea. But its not a set thing and theres no script. If it doesnt come together in a way I think is really great Im not going to do it. Ask him why he took the Batman role and he replies with characteristic honesty that he did it for his son. Sam thinks his dad is Batman, he laughs. Thats an incredible feeling. Everyone wants to be a superhero to their son, although it strikes me that one of the best things about Affleck is that he remains endearingly human. Live By Night is released on 13 January','entertainment'),(145,'Once upon a time, it was romance that roused the audiences in musicals. In Dreamgirls it is rage. The biggest whoops from the most vocal audience in London come when one singer leaves her rat husband, another walks away from the man who wont leave his wife and the woman who has just been dumped yells at her lover that shes not going. Casey Nicholaws production of Tom Eyen and Henry Kriegers show arrives in London 10 years after the movie, which starred Jennifer Hudson and Beyonc. With strong similarities to the story of Diana Ross, Florence Ballard and the Supremes, it whips through a chunk of musical history  from R&amp;B to disco  and a slice of racial prejudice. With glitz. Fishtail frocks, glittering curtains. Adam J Bernard snake-hipping away and dropping his trousers. Liisi LaFontaine in strong voice. It looks set to roar for years. Amber Riley  of Glee  is the knockout that she needs to be. Not least in I Am Changing, a number that requires a big punch, not simply a belting out. And that shows what it preaches. Riley begins to croon, all got up in sensible brown. As she proclaims that she has recovered her singing soul, the mummy rig disappears and she shimmers head to toe in blue glitter. Melody therapy.  At the Savoy theatre, London, booking until 21 October','entertainment'),(146,'He had a chequered past, spent time in prison, wasnt British, couldnt return home because he would have been persecuted there, and had no regular job. In other words, Farzad Bazoft was a journalist to his core, good looking in that fine-boned Persian way, attractive to women and a man ever eager to find a good story with which to make his mark in Fleet Street. Any editor, and particularly a foreign editor, knows the infinite variety and the chaotic ways of reporters, especially freelancers who live by the special insights or the unique information they can bring to the newspaper. Any editor also knows the trouble they bring if they get into difficulties abroad. Farzad wasnt the only one to get into trouble with a repressive regime or to fall into the wrong hands. Time and again Britons abroad find themselves in difficulties and time again their families complain of the same lack of support they get from the Foreign Office and the local embassy. Its something to do with the attitude that British diplomats take to their task. US ambassadors are trained to see themselves as representing the American people, singly and as a whole. British officials see themselves as representing the Queen and her government, the state and its interests, not the people who get into personal difficulties. That was certainly the case with Farzad. All the advice not to make a fuss, that quiet diplomacy was the best route  which private families so often hear  was offered in Farzads case. It didnt work, and couldnt. Once he fell into the hands of the Iraqi security forces, all the discreet diplomacy with their oleaginous foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, counted for nothing. A British journalist was a catch that Saddam Hussein wanted to use to demonstrate his power against Britain and her prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. What is more he was a journalist rootling around Iraqs closest secret, its arms programme. Only the toughest action by the British government could have got him released and that was not forthcoming. For all the emollient words offered by ministers to the Observer during Farzads imprisonment, usually with the sting hes not British after all and the deliberate government leaking of his record of imprisonment, Britain was never going to confront Baghdad. The interests of the state were in selling it arms. Its hard to say that it has changed since. Todays ambassadors are chosen from a wider social background and are more willing to speak out about local conditions. But the arms sales and the secrecy goes on. You only have to look at the continuing block on information about anything to do with Saudi Arabia or the Gulf to see that. Thinking of Farzad, I sometimes comfort myself for failing to prevent him going on that trip and for not doing more to support him and his cause during those awful weeks of incarceration with the knowledge that, ultimately, it was what he wanted. He was on to a good story, a major explosion in one of Iraqs top secret military facilities. If he had brought back proof of Saddams nuclear ambitions, it would have been a revelation of huge importance  although of course, as todays shocking revelations suggest, our government would have played it down for fear of the effect on our own arms sales there. COMMENTARY','politics'),(147,'The 51-year-old documentary-maker is best known for his award-winning 2015 film A Syrian Love Story. Born in Hull, he left school at 16 and spent periods signing on and working in a pea factory before going to the National Film and Television School at 28. He is the curator of Made in Hull, a week-long event involving projections on and installations in landmark buildings, created by a team of local and international artists. Opening tonight, it launches Hulls reign as UK City of Culture 2017. He and his partner, Ruth, live with their three children in Brixton. Whats the idea behind Made in Hull? We have a trail through the city that people can take for six hours each evening over seven days. It covers 75 years of a proud working city that has taken some knocks and has overcome them. Hull was the second most bombed city in the country in the second world war. Its heyday was in the 60s, when fishermen would come back from a three- or four-day fishing trip as millionaires. After that, the Icelandic wars [over territorial fishing rights] caused the demise of that industry and a recession. Now Hulls the City of Culture, and its got this marvellous contract with Siemens [to build offshore wind turbines], which is bringing hope and jobs. What kind of artworks will we see? Theres a 15-minute surroundsound piece on the whole history in Victoria Square by Hungarian animator Zsolt Balogh. The caravan industry is big in Hull so we have a piece on the history of that in one shop window in Whitefriargate, and a caravan with actors performing a comedic piece in another. Jesse Kanda, who has worked with Bjrk, is doing a piece about nightclubbing, which was a big scene in Hull. And on the Deep, the aquarium on the Humber, we are doing a piece about immigration called Departures and Arrivals: Hull voted 68% to leave Europe, although it has been made up of a mix of people since [local anti-slavery campaigner] William Wilberforces time. Hull was voted worst place to live in the book Crap Towns in 2003 People embraced that [laughs]! They made T-shirts saying Its never dull in Hull. Although of course it was. Now, within the city, there is so much going on subculturally, small things that just spring up and spread on social media. You go to a speakeasy or a performance poetry night and it is absolutely packed on a Monday night. What will being City of Culture mean to&nbsp;Hull? There is something about being at the end of the M62  geographically it is the end of the road. Theres a kind of cultural disconnect with the rest of the world because of that. As City of Culture, for the first time, we feel people are looking in and interested in what is going on in Hull. This seems a departure from your international documentaries or studies of Hulls working classes I wanted to say no when I was offered it, but it was one of those once-in-a-lifetime opportunities that you cant walk away from, and it opened my eyes to a different way of working, with a huge team, delegating a lot of the ideas. Our aim was to make the working-class population, 280,000 people, feel involved, because those people dont naturally feel involved in what is called art or culture. Having worked in factories and come from that culture myself, I dont naturally feel that is my world either. What does Hull mean to you? I have lived in Brixton for 20-odd years but when I talk about home, I still mean Hull. My parents are 92 and 93 and still live there, and my sisters and my friends. Whenever I have made a film abroad, Ive always come back to make a film in Hull. I thought, if Im going to make a film in Britain, I might as well make it in a place where no one else will [laughs].','entertainment'),(148,'You can imagine the pitch meeting that spewed out this idea: what if monster trucks were actually powered by monsters? The result is a screenplay that takes every off-road narrative short-cut available and ploughs its massive, over-inflated tyres over the clear influences that came before: ET, Gremlins and The Iron Giant, to name but a few. A power company is drilling for oil in the hills above the small town where Tripp (Lucas Till) dreams of escape. The over-empathic score rumbles ominously when a company exec (Rob Lowe) sneers on to the screen, so its no surprise that he orders the drills to keep working at the expense of what might be an undisturbed ecosystem under the rocks. Three giant oil-drinking tentacled creatures escape, one of them taking up residence in Tripps half-built truck. It takes a special kind of cluelessness for a film to make the gas-guzzling monster the hero, but its likely that the target audience  children under 12  will be so befuddled by all the noise and action that they wont notice the inconsistencies.','entertainment'),(149,'In December, footage emerged of the Japanese film director Hayao Miyazaki visiting the Dwango Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in Tokyo. In the clip, which was broadcast as part of an NHK documentary, the director of Spirited Away is shown a video of a computerised humanoid creature that has taught itself to walk by using its head and buttocks to shimmy along the ground. After the presentation Miyazaki sits in thought, before issuing his verdict. Whoever creates this stuff has no idea what pain is whatsoever, he says. I am utterly disgusted. Miyazakis delivery has none of the vein-throbbing fury of a Gordon Ramsay  only the life-haunting melancholy of the disappointed father. I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself, Miyazaki adds. A devastated researcher reels from the blow, and judging by the look on his face&nbsp;may&nbsp;never recover from it. The video game medium, which stems as much from the computer science tradition as that of the arts, has often prioritised technological advancement over humanity and empathy in its on-screen depictions. Miyazakis wounding judgment could be considered to be anti-experimental (indeed, the researcher eventually protests, mournfully: This is just our experiment) but his perspective is a useful splash of cold water on an industry that can pursue technological invention at the expense of other considerations. As the trajectory of video game technology has levelled out in the past few years, the question of how to build and populate virtual worlds is giving way to the deeper, tougher question of why. In 2017 we can expect to see a huge range of answers to that question. This months Resident Evil 7, the latest entry in the long-running Japanese horror series, will take us to sweltering Louisiana, to explore the dark history of a hick family that could have stepped from one of Truman Capotes grislier books. Here the goal is familiar and elemental: to exploit our fears. Night in the Woods has a different aim. College dropout Mae Borowski returns home to find an impoverished American community that has lost both hope and identity. Its a game about how the collapse of industry gives rise to mental illness and desperation. Yakuza 0, by contrast, will whisk us into the criminal underclass of Tokyos Kabukicho district, where yakuza factions vie for domination in clashes that can affect the city and its populace in drastic ways. At times of great political and environmental turmoil it follows that the themes of our fiction would return to former landscapes as a way to wrestle with futuristic questions. HBOs Westworld uses the wild west as a lens to examine our responsibility to robots. In a similar vein, Sonys Horizon Zero Dawn explores how, in a world where humans are returned to hunter-gathering, we might work with robots to ensure the survival of our species. For the developers of 2017s games, the fictional, tactile realities they create appeal to a range of human instincts. The hope surely is that, in their depictions, they treasure life rather than, as Miyazaki might put it, insult it.','tech'),(150,'A writer on both Meet the Parents and its sequel, Meet the Fockers, director and co-writer John Hamburg is already well versed in the comic possibilities of that excruciating first encounter between potential in-laws and prospective son-in-law. Here he approaches the uproarious culture clash between the strait-laced Fleming family from Michigan and their daughters tattooed hipster tech billionaire boyfriend, Laird (James Franco) with a relish that shows in a wealth of perceptive sight gags, and a whiplash comic timing that only flags at the end of the final act. Ned Fleming (Bryan Cranston), the well-loved boss of a printing company in Grand Rapids, is celebrating his 55th birthday when a Skype call from his Stanford student daughter Stephanie (Zoey Deutch) reveals a little more about her life than he had bargained for. Specifically, it reveals a secret boyfriend, and, mortifyingly for the buttoned-up Flemings, it reveals his naked buttocks, cavorting around her dorm room. Ned, his wife, Barb (Megan Mullally, excellent), and son, Scotty (Griffin Gluck), decide to spend Christmas in California in order to meet the new man in Stephanies life. Franco is a riot as Neds worst nightmare: part unfiltered id, part priapic puppy, hes given to the kind of huggy, over-sharing intimacy that fills a small-town, meat-and-potatoes man like Ned with visceral horror. Even worse for the proud but struggling proprietor of a printing company is the fact that Lairds slick hi-tech house is paper free. And yes, that includes the bathroom. An extended scene in which Lairds estate manager and self-defence trainer Gustav (Keegan-Michael Key) fixes a malfunctioning automatic toilet is mortifyingly funny. It works as well as it does for two reasons. First, the details of Lairds tech-funded play pad are brilliantly observed. Few things have made me giggle so much in a cinema this year as Lairds absurd art collection. Second, although Ned and Laird are at odds, neither is portrayed as a monster. They are both inherently decent men, just positioned at opposite ends of a very broad spectrum. And if the film drags a little at the end, its perhaps because the film-makers were enjoying the company of these characters as much as the audience undoubtedly will.','entertainment');
